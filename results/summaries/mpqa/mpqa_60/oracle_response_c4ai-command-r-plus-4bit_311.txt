SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or oust longtime leader Robert Mugabe, there are growing fears of civil war and political violence. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but accusations of election rigging and a surge in violence have raised concerns about the potential for post-election unrest. Government officials and military leaders have stated they would not allow Tsvangirai's party, the MDC, to rule, suggesting they would support a coup if he wins. There have been numerous human rights violations, including the abduction of polling agents and violent attacks in swing districts. Election laws have been revised in favor of the ruling party, and a new residency requirement may disenfranchise young opposition supporters. Many believe Mugabe will do everything to steal the election, and some predict he will announce martial law and jail Tsvangirai if he loses. With tensions high and a history of government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment, the outcome of the election is uncertain, and the potential for a violent aftermath is a significant concern.
