SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote, many fear violence and even civil war, regardless of who wins the election. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but a surge in political violence and accusations of rigging the vote have raised concerns that neither side will accept the outcome. Government officials have made disturbing pronouncements, vowing not to allow Tsvangirai to lead the country, even suggesting they would support a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly opposition supporters. The government has been accused of numerous human rights violations, which they deny. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party tired of corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. If Mugabe announces victory, people may storm the streets, while if Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe may declare martial law and send the army into the streets. The government has also been accused of trying to steal the election through revised election laws and procedures.
