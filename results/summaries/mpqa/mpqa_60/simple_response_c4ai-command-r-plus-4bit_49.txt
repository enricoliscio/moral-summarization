SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide whether to re-elect Robert Mugabe or choose challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, there are growing fears of potential violence and civil unrest depending on the outcome. The country's future hangs in the balance as citizens worry about the possibility of a rigged election and the potential for a military coup or widespread rioting if the results are not accepted by all parties. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party has been accused of human rights violations and changing election laws to favor them, while the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) faces the threat of their polling agents being abducted and supporters being disenfranchised. The contest is seen as a battle between an autocratic leader clinging to power and a youthful opposition seeking change. The fear of post-election violence is palpable, with many Zimbabweans concerned about the potential for a civil war or martial law. The question of how the loser and their supporters will react to the election results remains a pressing concern, with some government officials even hinting at a coup should Tsvangirai's MDC win. The outcome is uncertain, and the world watches with bated breath as Zimbabwe decides its future.
