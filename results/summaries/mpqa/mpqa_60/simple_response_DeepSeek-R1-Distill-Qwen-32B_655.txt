Okay, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the Zimbabwean election with Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai as the main contenders. There's fear of violence and civil war if the election results aren't accepted. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, is accused of rigging the vote through changing election laws, which could disenfranchise voters, especially young supporters of the opposition MDC. There have been 34 deaths in political violence, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's government is also accused of human rights violations.

The moral issues here include the potential for election fraud, violence, and suppression of opposition. The article highlights the tension between Mugabe's regime and the opposition, with concerns about the fairness and legitimacy of the election process.

I should focus on the main points: the fear of violence, the accusations of rigging, the impact on voters, and the moral concerns about the election's integrity. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include these elements while maintaining the original moral framing.

Let me structure the summary to first mention the fear of violence, then the accusations of election rigging, the impact on voters, and the potential consequences if the election isn't accepted. I'll make sure to highlight the moral issues like suppression of the opposition and the risks of civil war.

I should also mention key details like the number of deaths, the changes in election laws, and Mugabe's actions to consolidate power. It's important to convey the tension and the stakes involved in the election.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the essential moral points without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans prepare for the upcoming election, fears of violence and civil war loom large, with many questioning whether the loser and their supporters will accept the results. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is ahead in polls, but concerns over political violence and election rigging have heightened tensions. Senior government officials and military leaders have openly opposed Tsvangirai's leadership, raising fears of a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and manipulating election laws to disenfranchise young opposition voters. Changes in polling stations and vote-counting procedures could favor ZANU-PF, while independent monitors are being barred. Analysts warn that Mugabe may jail Tsvangirai if he loses, to maintain power. The election is seen as a clash between an aging autocrat and a restless opposition. Tsvangirai has promised not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, but the fear of stolen votes and potential unrest remains. END OF SUMMARY.
