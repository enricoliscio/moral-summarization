SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in an election that could oust longtime leader Robert Mugabe, there are growing fears of civil war and political violence. Surveys show the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, ahead of Mugabe, but a recent surge in violence and accusations of election rigging have raised concerns about the potential for post-election unrest. Government officials and military leaders have stated they would not tolerate a victory for Tsvangirai's party, the MDC, and have even suggested they would support a coup if he wins. At least 34 people, mostly MDC supporters, have died in political violence this year. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and election rigging, while Tsvangirai faces treason charges based on an edited videotape. The outcome is uncertain, as ZANU-PF officials have revised election laws and procedures in their favor, and there are reports of abducted polling agents and MDC supporters being disenfranchised. Many believe that Mugabe will announce martial law and jail Tsvangirai if he loses, while an MDC victory could lead to rioting and military intervention. The situation has raised fears of a stolen election and further political violence in Zimbabwe.
END OF SUMMARY.
