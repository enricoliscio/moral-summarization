Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Zimbabwean elections with concerns about violence, potential rigging, and the implications of the election outcome. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It mentions fears of civil war, Morgan Tsvangirai leading the opposition, and Robert Mugabe's government's actions. There's talk of political violence, changes in election laws, and the possibility of rigging. The article also touches on the historical context, like the Matabeleland massacres.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral issues, such as the threat of violence, election fraud, and the suppression of opposition. I should include the fear of civil war, the surge in violence, the changes in election laws, and the potential consequences if either side doesn't accept the results.

I should also mention the charges against Tsvangirai and the concerns about voter suppression. It's important to note Mugabe's possible actions to stay in power and the opposition's fears of a military coup or martial law.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the context, then discuss the concerns about violence and election integrity, followed by the implications of the election outcome, and conclude with the broader moral concerns about democracy and human rights.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without going into too much detail. I'll make sure to include the main actors, Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the fears of violence, the election irregularities, and the potential for conflict.

I should also mention the historical reference to the Matabeleland massacres to add context about Mugabe's past actions, which adds to the moral framing about accountability and justice.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear widespread violence and instability as they prepare for the upcoming election, with concerns that neither side will accept the result. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is leading in polls, but fears of political violence and election rigging are high. Senior government officials and military leaders have threatened to support a coup if Tsvangirai wins, while 34 people, mostly MDC supporters, have died in political violence this year. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations, and there are allegations of election laws being changed to rig the vote. The opposition fears voter suppression tactics, such as reduced polling stations in urban areas and residency requirements that could disenfranchise young supporters. Mugabe's government has also banned independent monitors from observing vote-counting. Tsvangirai has been charged with high treason based on a controversial videotape, and analysts suggest this could be a ploy to jail him if he wins. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe, desperate to retain power, and the opposition, weary of corruption and economic hardship. The fear is that either a Mugabe victory or Tsvangirai's win could lead to chaos, with Mugabe potentially declaring martial law or Tsvangirai supporters storming the capital. The moral stakes are high, with concerns about democracy, justice, and accountability for past atrocities, such as the Matabeleland massacres. END OF SUMMARY.
