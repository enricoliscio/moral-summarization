Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the ethical issues presented in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Zimbabwean election, the fears of violence, and the concerns about election rigging. The author uses a lot of morally charged words like "violence," "rig," "steal," "abducted," etc. My goal is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I should start by identifying the key events: the upcoming election, the fear of civil war, the challenger Morgan Tsvangirai leading in polls, but Mugabe's government is accused of rigging the vote. There's also violence against MDC supporters, human rights violations, and Mugabe's possible reactions if he loses.

I need to structure the summary to highlight these points, using the moral terms. Maybe start with the fear of violence and civil war, mention the election, the polls, the accusations of rigging, the violence, and Mugabe's potential actions. Also, include the election law changes and the disenfranchisement of young voters.

I should make sure to include words like "violence," "war," "rig," "died," "violations," "corruption," "unemployment," "steal," "abducted," "attacks," "revised," "bans," "disenfranchise," "steal," "attack," "killed." I need to weave these into the summary naturally.

I'll also need to mention Mugabe's age and the opposition's supporters' restlessness, as well as the possible outcomes if either side wins. The summary should convey the tension and the ethical concerns surrounding the election.

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many of the specified terms as possible. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the upcoming election, with Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, leading in polls against long-time ruler Robert Mugabe. Concerns about political violence, human rights violations, and election rigging are widespread, with 34 deaths linked to political violence this year, mostly targeting Tsvangirai's supporters. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party has revised election laws to increase polling stations in rural areas and reduce them in urban areas, potentially disenfranchising young opposition supporters. Independent monitors are barred from observing vote-counting, raising fears of vote tampering. Senior officials and military leaders have threatened to support a coup if Tsvangirai wins, while Mugabe's government has accused him of plotting his assassination. Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, but fears of martial law and violence persist. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the opposition's demand for change amid corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The risk of violence and instability looms large as Zimbabwe braces for the results. END OF SUMMARY.
