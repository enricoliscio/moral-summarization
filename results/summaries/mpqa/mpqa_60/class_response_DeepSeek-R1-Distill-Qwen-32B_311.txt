Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the Zimbabwean elections, the fear of violence, and the concerns about vote-rigging. Mugabe is the incumbent, and Tsvangirai is the challenger. There's a lot of tension, with fears of civil war if the election isn't accepted. The government is accused of changing election laws to rig the vote, and there's been political violence, with MDC supporters being targeted.

I should highlight the key moral issues: violence, rigging, deaths, corruption, shortages, unemployment, coup threats, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll structure it by mentioning the election, the fear of violence, the accusations of rigging, the deaths, Mugabe's actions, the opposition's concerns, and the potential for conflict. I'll make sure to use as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me start drafting: Zimbabweans fear violence as they head to the polls. Mugabe's government is accused of rigging the vote. 34 deaths in political violence. Mugabe's supporters threaten a coup if Tsvangirai wins. The MDC faces abduction of polling agents and vote-counting manipulation. Mugabe's supporters aim to steal the election. The article emphasizes the risks of conflict and the unethical tactics employed.

I need to ensure all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Let me put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the election, with concerns that neither side will accept the result. Morgan Tsvangirai, the challenger, is ahead in polls, but accusations of vote-rigging and political violence have heightened tensions. At least 34 people, mostly MDC supporters, have died in political violence. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations, and officials have threatened a coup if Tsvangirai wins. The ruling party, ZANU-PF, has revised election laws to increase polling stations in rural areas and reduce them in urban areas, potentially discouraging MDC supporters from voting. Independent monitors have been barred from observing the vote-counting, and a residency requirement could disenfranchise young opposition supporters. Analysts warn that Mugabe may jail Tsvangirai if he loses, while Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the MDC's push for change, with fears of widespread violence and unrest. END OF SUMMARY.
