SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in the upcoming election, many fear violence and unrest, regardless of the outcome. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the governing party has been accused of rigging the election and using violence to intimidate opposition supporters. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, and many more have been abducted or attacked. Government officials have made pronouncements that they will not accept a Tsvangirai government, with some even supporting a coup. The election has been marred by corruption, food shortages, and unemployment, leading to widespread discontent. Many fear that if Mugabe loses, he will impose martial law and jail Tsvangirai, while others believe that if Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe's supporters will riot. The government has been accused of numerous human rights violations, and the election process has been criticized for its unfair procedures. With tensions running high, many Zimbabweans are bracing themselves for a violent aftermath. END OF SUMMARY.
