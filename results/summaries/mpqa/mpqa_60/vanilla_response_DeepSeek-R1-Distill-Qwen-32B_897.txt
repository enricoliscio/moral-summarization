Alright, I need to summarize this article about Zimbabwe's elections. Let me read through it first. 

The article talks about fears of violence after the vote. Zimbabweans are worried about civil war. Robert Mugabe is the current leader, and Morgan Tsvangirai is the challenger. Polls show Tsvangirai is ahead, but there's a lot of violence and concerns about election rigging.

Hmm, the government might not accept the results. There are reports of Mugabe putting the military on high alert. Some officials have even talked about supporting a coup if Tsvangirai wins. 

There's been political violence, mostly against Tsvangirai's supporters. The U.S. State Department accused Mugabe's government of human rights violations. 

Election laws have been changed, which could affect the outcome. They're adding more polling stations in rural areas and reducing in cities, which might discourage Tsvangirai supporters. Also, they're using civil service employees to monitor counting and banning independent monitors. 

A residency requirement could disenfranchise young voters. Mugabe might try to jail Tsvangirai if he loses. Tsvangirai has promised not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins, which might relieve some pressure on Mugabe.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. Focus on the main points: fears of violence, Mugabe vs Tsvangirai, election rigging concerns, violence against supporters, changes in election laws, and potential for conflict.

Make sure to include that Mugabe might not accept defeat, the government's actions to influence the election, and the potential for civil war. Also, mention the impact of the residency requirement and the charges against Tsvangirai.

I should structure it to flow logically: introduce the situation, mention the candidates, the concerns about election integrity, the violence, Mugabe's possible reactions, and the overall fear of conflict.

Let me put it all together concisely, making sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and instability as they prepare for the weekend's election, with concerns over whether the loser and their supporters will accept the results. Robert Mugabe, the country's longtime leader, faces Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader and opposition candidate, who is ahead in polls. However, fears of political violence, election rigging, and a potential refusal to accept defeat have heightened tensions. Senior government officials and military leaders have hinted at supporting a coup if Tsvangirai wins, while Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and changing election laws to ensure his victory. These changes include increasing polling stations in rural areas, reducing them in cities, and banning independent monitors. A residency requirement could also disenfranchise young opposition supporters. Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins, potentially easing pressure on Mugabe to remain in power. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the opposition's push for change, with fears of civil war if the results are contested. END OF SUMMARY.
