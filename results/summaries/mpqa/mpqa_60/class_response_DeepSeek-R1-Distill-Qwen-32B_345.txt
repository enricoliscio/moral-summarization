Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Zimbabwean elections where Robert Mugabe is up for re-election. There's a lot of tension because Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is challenging him. The key moral issues here are violence, rigging, and the potential for civil war.

I notice the author uses words like "violence," "rig," "rioters," "coup," "died," "violations," etc. These words carry strong moral connotations, so I need to include as many as possible in the summary without making it too long.

The article mentions that Tsvangirai is ahead in surveys, but there's fear that Mugabe's party might rig the election. There's been political violence, with 34 deaths, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's party is accused of human rights violations and changing election laws to favor their side. They're increasing polling stations in rural areas and reducing them in cities, which could disenfranchise urban voters, many of whom support the opposition.

There's also the issue of Mugabe putting the army on high alert and the threat of a coup if Tsvangirai wins. The opposition fears that Mugabe won't accept defeat and might declare martial law. Tsvangirai has been charged with treason based on an edited video, which might be a ploy to jail him if he loses.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by highlighting the election context, the fear of violence and civil war, the accusations of rigging, the violence against MDC supporters, the changes in election procedures, and the potential for a coup or martial law. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

Let me structure it: Start with the election and the fear of violence. Mention Tsvangirai leading but concerns about rigging. Include the violence, Mugabe's actions, the changes in polling stations, the residency requirement, and the treason charges. Conclude with the fear of civil war and the stakes involved.

I need to keep each sentence concise and include as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the election to re-elect or oust Robert Mugabe. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is ahead in surveys, but concerns about political violence and election rigging loom large. At least 34 people, mostly MDC supporters, have died in political violence. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party has been accused of human rights violations and changing election laws to rig the vote. They plan to increase polling stations in rural areas and reduce them in urban areas, potentially disenfranchising young opposition supporters. A residency requirement could also prevent many from voting. Tsvangirai has been charged with treason based on an edited video, which analysts see as a ploy to jail him if he loses. Fear of a coup or martial law if either side loses persists, with Mugabe's supporters vowing not to accept Tsvangirai's leadership. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the opposition's desire for change, with the stakes high for Zimbabwe's future. END OF SUMMARY.
