SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide whether to re-elect Robert Mugabe or choose challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, fears of post-election violence and civil war are mounting. Surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but the country's history of political violence and recent accusations of election rigging by Mugabe's party have raised concerns about the acceptance of the results by both sides. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept a Tsvangirai victory, threatening a coup. This, along with reports of human rights violations, food shortages, and unemployment, has created a tense atmosphere. There are also concerns about election procedures, with the governing party planning to increase polling stations in their strongholds and reduce them in opposition areas, potentially disenfranchising young opposition supporters. The opposition's claim that their polling agents have been abducted and concerns about revised election laws add to the uncertainty. Many worry that Mugabe will steal the election or jail Tsvangirai to stay in power. The outcome remains uncertain, and the potential for civil unrest and further violence is high.
END OF SUMMARY.
