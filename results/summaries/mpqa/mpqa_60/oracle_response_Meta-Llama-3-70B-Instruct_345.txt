SUMMARY:

Fear of violence and war grips Zimbabwe as the country prepares for elections, with many believing that the loser will not accept the results. Surveys show opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of President Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and accusations of rigged election laws have raised concerns. Government officials have made disturbing pronouncements, saying they would not allow Tsvangirai to lead the country, and even hinted at supporting a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly supporters of Tsvangirai's party. The government has been accused of human rights violations, and Mugabe has put the armed forces on "high alert". Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party weary of corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. If Mugabe announces victory, people may storm the streets, while if Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe may declare martial law and jail him.
