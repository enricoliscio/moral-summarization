SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans prepare to vote, many fear violence and civil war, with concerns that neither party will accept the election results. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the ruling party has been accused of human rights violations and rigging the vote. Senior government officials have made intolerable pronouncements, threatening a coup if Tsvangirai wins. At least 34 people have died in political violence, and many more have been abducted. The government has been accused of corruption, and Tsvangirai has been charged with high treason. The election has been marred by violence, intimidation, and attempts to disenfranchise opposition supporters. Many fear that if Mugabe loses, he will impose martial law and jail Tsvangirai. The outcome of the election is far from certain, and the country teeters on the brink of chaos.
END OF SUMMARY.
