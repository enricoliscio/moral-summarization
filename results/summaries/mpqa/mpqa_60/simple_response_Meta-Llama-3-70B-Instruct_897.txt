SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in the presidential election, many fear violence and unrest, regardless of the outcome. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the ruling party has been accused of rigging the vote and using violence to intimidate opposition supporters. Government officials and military leaders have threatened not to accept a Tsvangirai victory, with some even suggesting a coup. The election has been marred by violence, with at least 34 people killed, mostly opposition supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations and has put the armed forces on high alert. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocratic leader desperate to remain in power and an opposition party seeking change. The outcome is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the risk of violence and unrest is high.
