SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote, many fear violence and a potential civil war. The election has been marred by political violence, with 34 people killed, mostly supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Government officials have made pronouncements that they will not accept an MDC win, with one senior official even suggesting a coup if necessary. The ruling party has been accused of numerous human rights violations, including rigging the election and using edited videotapes to charge opposition leaders with treason. The opposition claims that 22 of their polling agents have been abducted and violent attacks have surged in swing districts. Election laws and procedures have been revised to favor the ruling party, which could lead to a rigged outcome. Many Zimbabweans see this election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party fighting against government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The outcome is far from certain, but one thing is clear: Mugabe will stop at nothing to steal this election.
