SUMMARY: Many Zimbabweans fear political violence and even civil war in the aftermath of the country's upcoming election. Robert Mugabe, the country's longtime leader, is facing a strong challenge from Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader. Surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but there are concerns that neither side is prepared to accept a loss. Government officials and military leaders have suggested they would not allow Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, to take power. This has raised fears of a coup or other violent unrest. There has already been a surge in political violence, with at least 34 people dying, most of them supporters of the opposition. The government has been accused of human rights violations and rigging the election through changes in voting laws and procedures. There are also concerns about abduction of polling agents and voter disenfranchisement. Many see the election as a contest between an autocratic leader and a youthful opposition seeking to end corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The outcome remains uncertain, but there are fears that Mugabe may use the treason charges against Tsvangirai as an excuse to jail him and stay in power.
END OF SUMMARY.
