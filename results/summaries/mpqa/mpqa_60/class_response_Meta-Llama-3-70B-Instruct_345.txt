SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote, fears of violence and unrest are rampant. Many believe that neither party will accept the election results, leading to a potential civil war. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the governing party has been accused of rigging the vote and using violent tactics to intimidate opposition supporters. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change. Government officials have made pronouncements that they will not allow Tsvangirai to take power, even suggesting they would support a coup. The election has been marred by corruption, food shortages, and unemployment, leading to widespread discontent. If Mugabe announces victory, many believe people will "storm the castle," while if Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe may impose martial law and jail him for treason. The election has been marked by attacks, abductions, and edited videotapes, leading many to believe that Mugabe will stop at nothing to remain in power.
