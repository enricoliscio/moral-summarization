Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article about Zimbabwe's elections. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, so first, I should read through the article to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about the fear of violence after the election, with Mugabe possibly rigging the vote. There's a lot of tension between the ruling party and the opposition. The moral angle here seems to be about justice, fairness, and the consequences of power. The author is highlighting the potential for violence and the undemocratic tactics used by Mugabe's party.

I need to make sure the summary captures that tension and the moral concerns. I should include key points like the fear of civil war, the accusations of vote-rigging, the violence against opposition supporters, and the implications for democracy. Also, mentioning Mugabe's past actions and the opposition's stance on not prosecuting him adds depth to the moral framing.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the essence without losing the moral perspective. Let me structure it by first introducing the fear of violence, then the election dynamics, followed by Mugabe's tactics and the opposition's response. Ending with the broader implications ties it all together.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each sentence adds value and sticks to the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and instability as they prepare for the weekend's election, with concerns that neither side will accept the result. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is ahead in polls, but fears of vote-rigging and political violence loom large. Senior government officials and military leaders have hinted at rejecting Tsvangirai's leadership, raising fears of a coup or civil war. At least 34 MDC supporters have been killed in political violence this year. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, has allegedly manipulated election laws, reduced polling stations in urban areas, and banned independent monitors, raising suspicions of vote tampering. Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins, but analysts warn that Mugabe may jail him to retain power. The election is seen as a clash between an aging autocrat and a restless youth seeking change. The outcome could determine Zimbabwe's path toward democracy or continued turmoil. END OF SUMMARY.
