SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, the possibility of political violence and civil war looms large. Robert Mugabe, the incumbent, is facing off against challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, and both sides have made it clear that they may not accept a loss. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party has been accused of changing election laws to rig the vote in their favor, and there have been reports of human rights violations and political violence, with at least 34 people dying this year, mostly supporters of Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change. Senior government officials and military leaders have stated they would not accept a Tsvangirai victory, and Mugabe has been accused of preparing to declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai on trumped-up charges if he loses. The opposition, meanwhile, alleges that their polling agents have been abducted and that changes to voting procedures will disenfranchise young voters who support them. With both sides refusing to concede and tensions rising, many fear that the election could spark civil unrest or even civil war in Zimbabwe.
