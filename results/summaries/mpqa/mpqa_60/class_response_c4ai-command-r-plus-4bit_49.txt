SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide whether to re-elect Robert Mugabe or choose challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, there are growing fears of political violence and civil unrest. Surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but the country's history of election rigging and the surge in political violence raise concerns about the acceptance of the results by both parties and their supporters. Government officials and military leaders have made pronouncements suggesting they would not accept a Tsvangirai victory, even supporting a coup. The ruling party, ZANU-PF, has been accused of human rights violations and election rigging, including changing election laws and procedures to increase polling stations in their rural strongholds and reduce them in urban areas with strong opposition support. The opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has faced violent attacks, with at least 34 supporters dying this year. There are also concerns about the disenfranchisement of young opposition supporters due to a new residency requirement. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the MDC's fight against corruption, shortages, and unemployment. The outcome is uncertain, with the possibility of post-election violence and a last-ditch effort by Mugabe to stay in power.
END OF SUMMARY.
