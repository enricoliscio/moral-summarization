SUMMARY: Fears of violence and war are escalating in Zimbabwe as the country prepares for elections, with many believing that neither side will accept the outcome. The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the ruling party, led by Robert Mugabe, has been accused of rigging the election and perpetrating human rights violations. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, and many more are expected to be killed if the election results are disputed. Government officials have made disturbing pronouncements, saying they would not allow Tsvangirai to take power and even hinted at supporting a coup. The election has been marred by corruption, food shortages, and unemployment, and many fear that Mugabe will announce martial law and send the army into the streets if he loses. The opposition has accused the government of stealing the election, and analysts believe that the outcome is far from certain. END OF SUMMARY.
