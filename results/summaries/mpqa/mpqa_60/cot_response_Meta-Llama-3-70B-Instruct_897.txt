SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans prepare to vote, many fear violence and unrest after the election. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead of President Robert Mugabe in surveys, but Mugabe's supporters are unwilling to accept defeat. Government officials have made intolerable pronouncements, threatening a coup if Tsvangirai wins. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, with allegations of human rights violations against Mugabe's government. The opposition party accuses Mugabe of desperation to remain in power, citing corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The election has been marred by violence, fear, and unrest, with reports of abduction and attacks on opposition supporters. Mugabe's government has also been accused of trying to steal the election through revised election laws and procedures. END OF SUMMARY.
