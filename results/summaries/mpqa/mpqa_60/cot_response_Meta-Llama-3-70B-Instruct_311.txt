SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans prepare to vote, many fear a civil war may erupt due to the "intolerable" prospect of a government led by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Senior government officials have hinted at a "coup" if Tsvangirai wins, citing the need to prevent being "ruled" by the Movement for Democratic Change. The election campaign has been marred by "human rights violations" and "violations" of election laws, with at least 34 people killed in political violence. President Robert Mugabe, a 78-year-old "autocrat", is "desperate" to remain in power, while Tsvangirai's supporters are weary of government "corruption", food shortages, and unemployment. Many fear that Mugabe will "steal" the election, and if he loses, he may impose "martial law" and jail Tsvangirai on "treason" charges. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: Zimbabwe is on the brink of chaos.
