SUMMARY:

Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence after the upcoming election, as concerns grow that neither the ruling party nor the opposition is prepared to accept the outcome. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of President Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and allegations of election rigging have raised tensions. Senior government officials and military leaders have stated they will not allow Tsvangirai to take power, with one official even suggesting they would support a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly opposition supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations, and Mugabe has put the armed forces on high alert. Many Zimbabweans fear that if Mugabe loses, he will impose martial law and jail Tsvangirai, while others believe that if Tsvangirai wins, his supporters will take to the streets.
