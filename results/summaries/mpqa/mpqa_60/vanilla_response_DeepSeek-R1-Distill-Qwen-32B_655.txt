Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe elections. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about the fear of violence after the Zimbabwe vote. People are worried about civil war because Robert Mugabe is running again, and Morgan Tsvangirai is the challenger. Surveys show Tsvangirai is ahead, but there's a lot of political violence and concerns about vote rigging. 

Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, has made changes to election laws which could help them win, even if Tsvangirai is popular. There have been 34 deaths this year, mostly MDC supporters. The US State Department accused Mugabe's government of human rights violations, which they deny.

There's also talk about Mugabe putting the army on high alert, but the police denied that. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe and the opposition. If Mugabe loses, he might declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai, though, said he wouldn't prosecute Mugabe if he wins, which might reduce pressure on Mugabe to step down.

The article also mentions that ZANU-PF is changing polling stations to favor rural areas, which are their strongholds, and making it harder for urban voters, especially young ones, to vote. This could disenfranchise many opposition supporters.

So, the main points are: fear of violence, Tsvangirai leading in polls, Mugabe's party changing election laws, concerns about rigging, potential for civil war, and the impact of these changes on voter turnout.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY. I should mention the key issues: violence fears, Mugabe vs Tsvangirai, election rigging, voter suppression tactics, and the potential for conflict.

Let me structure it: Start with the fear of violence, mention Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the polls, concerns about rigging, Mugabe's party's actions, the impact on voters, and the possibility of civil war. Also, include Tsvangirai's statement about not prosecuting Mugabe.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all the main points without getting too detailed. Let me put it together.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the upcoming election, with Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai as key contenders. Despite Tsvangirai leading in polls, concerns about vote rigging and political violence persist. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, has altered election laws and procedures, potentially favoring rural areas and disenfranchising urban voters, especially young opposition supporters. Tensions are high, with fears of post-election conflict if either side refuses to accept results. Mugabe's government is accused of human rights violations, and there are allegations of army mobilization. Tsvangirai has pledged not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, possibly reducing pressure on Mugabe to step down. END OF SUMMARY.
