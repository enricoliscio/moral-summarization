Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's elections. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to get the main points.

The article talks about fears of violence after the election. Mugabe is the long-time leader, and Tsvangirai is the challenger. Surveys show Tsvangirai is ahead, but there's a lot of violence and concerns about vote-rigging. Both sides might not accept the results, leading to potential civil war.

I should note the key elements: Mugabe's government's actions, the violence against MDC supporters, the election laws changes, and the fear of post-election violence. The moral framing is about the risks of Mugabe's regime, the potential for fraud, and the dangers of not accepting the results.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral concerns. I'll structure it to highlight Mugabe's tactics, the violence, and the fear of civil war. Also, mention Tsvangirai's stance on not prosecuting Mugabe if he wins, which is a moral point about reconciliation versus justice.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details and focus on the main moral issues: the threat of violence, election rigging, and the potential for instability. I'll make sure to include Mugabe's age and the opposition's supporters' demographics to show the generational divide.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all the key moral points without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear widespread violence as they prepare for the upcoming election, with concerns that neither side will accept the results. Robert Mugabe, the country's long-time leader, faces Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader, in a highly contentious race. Surveys suggest Tsvangirai is ahead, but Mugabe's government has been accused of rigging the vote and committing human rights violations, including the deaths of 34 MDC supporters. Senior officials and military leaders have openly threatened to oppose a Tsvangirai government, with one stating that they would support a coup if necessary. Mugabe's party has also revised election laws to favor rural areas, limit opposition monitors, and disenfranchise urban voters, particularly young MDC supporters. Tsvangirai has been charged with high treason, based on a controversial videotape, and analysts fear Mugabe may jail him if he loses. Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, potentially avoiding accountability for past human rights abuses. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the opposition's push for change, with fears of civil war if the results are contested. END OF SUMMARY.
