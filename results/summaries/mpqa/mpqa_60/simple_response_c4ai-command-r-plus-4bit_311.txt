SUMMARY: With Zimbabwe's election approaching, many fear that the country may descend into civil war or other forms of political violence regardless of the outcome. The incumbent, Robert Mugabe, and his primary challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, are locked in a bitter contest that has already seen bloodshed. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and election rigging, while Tsvangirai faces treason charges for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe. The fear of post-election unrest is palpable, with government officials and military leaders suggesting they would not accept a victory for Tsvangirai and his party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The potential for violence is heightened by the abduction of MDC polling agents and changes to election laws that favor Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party. Many worry that Mugabe may declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai if he loses, while a victory for Mugabe could spark riots by opposition supporters. The situation has raised concerns among election monitors and diplomats, who fear that neither side is prepared to accept the election results peacefully. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, but the potential for civil strife and political repression in Zimbabwe is all too real.
