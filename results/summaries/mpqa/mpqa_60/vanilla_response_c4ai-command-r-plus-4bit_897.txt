SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect President Robert Mugabe, tensions are high as many fear the potential for violence and civil war, regardless of the election outcome. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging by the governing party have raised concerns about the acceptance of the results. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept a victory for Tsvangirai and his party, the MDC, even suggesting they would support a coup. The election is seen as a battle between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the opposition's desire for change, with many predicting unrest and potential civil war if Mugabe wins. The government has been accused of human rights violations during the campaign, and Mugabe is believed to be preparing to steal the election through various tactics. The opposition, however, faces challenges with abducted polling agents and revised election laws that may discourage voters. The outcome remains uncertain, but the fear of post-election violence persists.

END OF SUMMARY.
