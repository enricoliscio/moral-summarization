SUMMARY:

Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence after the upcoming election, with many fearing that neither side will accept the results. Surveys show opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of President Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging have raised concerns. Government officials and military leaders have stated that they will not allow Tsvangirai to take power, with one official even suggesting that they would support a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly Tsvangirai supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations, and Mugabe has put the armed forces on high alert. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party dominated by young citizens weary of government corruption and food shortages.
