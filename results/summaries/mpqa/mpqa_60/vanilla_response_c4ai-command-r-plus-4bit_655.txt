SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, there are growing concerns about potential violence and civil war regardless of the election outcome. Robert Mugabe, the country's long-time ruler, is facing a strong challenge from Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader. Surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but the country's history of political violence and recent changes to election laws have raised alarms. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept a victory for Tsvangirai's party, the MDC, and there have been reports of human rights violations and election rigging by Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the young, restless citizens supporting the opposition. There are fears that Mugabe will declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai if he loses, while the opposition worries about voter suppression and intimidation tactics by ZANU-PF. The outcome is uncertain, but many expect post-election turmoil regardless of who wins.

END OF SUMMARY.
