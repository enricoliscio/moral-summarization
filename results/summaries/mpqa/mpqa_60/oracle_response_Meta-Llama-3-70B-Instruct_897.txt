SUMMARY:

Fears of violence and even civil war are gripping Zimbabwe as the country prepares for elections, with many doubting that the loser will accept the results. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but a surge in political violence and accusations of rigged election laws have raised concerns. Government officials and military leaders have vowed not to allow Tsvangirai's party to take power, with some even suggesting they would support a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly opposition supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations, and Mugabe has put the armed forces on "high alert." Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party weary of government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. If Mugabe announces victory, many expect people to take to the streets, while if Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe may impose martial law and jail him.
