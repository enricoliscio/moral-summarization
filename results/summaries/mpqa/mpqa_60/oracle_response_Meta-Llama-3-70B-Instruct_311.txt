SUMMARY:

Fear of violence and even civil war grips Zimbabwe as the country prepares for elections, with many doubting that the loser will accept the results. Surveys show opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of President Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and allegations of rigged election laws have sparked widespread concerns. Government officials have threatened not to allow a Tsvangirai government, with one senior official even suggesting they would support a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly supporters of the opposition. The US has accused Mugabe's government of human rights violations, which they deny. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party weary of government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The outcome is far from certain, with opposition officials claiming 22 of their polling agents have been abducted and violent attacks may persuade some to vote for Mugabe. END OF SUMMARY.
