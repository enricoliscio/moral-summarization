Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's elections. The user is asking for a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points. The article talks about fears of violence after the vote, so that's a key point. Mugabe is the current leader, and Tsvangirai is the challenger. Surveys show Tsvangirai is ahead, but there's a lot of concern about how the losers might react. 

I should mention the political violence and the accusations of election rigging. The government is changing election laws, which could affect the outcome. There's also the issue of voter disenfranchisement, especially with the residency requirement. 

Mugabe's government is accused of human rights violations, and there are concerns about the military's role. The article mentions that some government officials have indicated they might not accept Tsvangirai's win, which adds to the tension. 

I need to highlight the potential for post-election violence and the possible coup. Also, Tsvangirai's promise not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins is an important point, as it might influence Mugabe's actions. 

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll structure it by mentioning the election context, the fears of violence, the concerns about rigging, the impact of new laws, and the potential consequences of the election outcome. 

Let me make sure I cover all these points without going into too much detail. I'll start with the election context, then move to the violence and rigging concerns, followed by the impact of the new laws, and end with the possible outcomes and Tsvangirai's statement. 

I think that's a solid structure. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence as they prepare for this weekend's election, with fears of civil war looming. Robert Mugabe, the country's only leader since independence, faces challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, who is ahead in surveys. However, concerns about political violence, election rigging, and refusal to accept results are widespread. Senior officials and military leaders have threatened to resist a Tsvangirai victory, with one stating support for a coup if needed. At least 34 MDC supporters have died in violence this year. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and altering election laws to ensure his victory, including reducing polling stations in urban areas and banning independent monitors. A residency requirement could disenfranchise young opposition supporters. Tsvangirai has promised not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, potentially easing pressure on Mugabe to cling to power. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe's autocracy and the opposition's demand for change, with fears of post-election chaos. END OF SUMMARY.
