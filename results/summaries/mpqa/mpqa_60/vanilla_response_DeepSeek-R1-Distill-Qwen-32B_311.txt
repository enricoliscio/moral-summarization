Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe elections. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about the fear of violence after the vote. People are worried about a civil war. The main figures are Robert Mugabe, the long-time president, and Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader. Surveys show Tsvangirai is ahead, but there's a lot of violence and concerns about vote-rigging.

The government is accused of changing election laws to their advantage. There are reports of Mugabe putting the military on high alert, though the police deny it. The opposition fears that if Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe might declare martial law. There are also charges of high treason against Tsvangirai based on a videotape, which seems to be a setup.

The article mentions that Mugabe's party is manipulating polling stations and election monitoring to favor their side. There's a residency requirement that could disenfranchise many young voters who support the opposition. Mugabe is doing everything to steal the election, according to critics.

Tsvangirai says he won't prosecute Mugabe if he wins, which might ease Mugabe's fear of prosecution for past human rights abuses.

So, the summary should cover the main points: fear of violence, Mugabe vs Tsvangirai, vote-rigging concerns, opposition supporters being targeted, changes in election laws, and the potential for civil unrest. It should be concise, under 200 words, and in the specified format.

I need to make sure I include all these elements without getting too detailed. Maybe start with the fear of violence, mention the election, Mugabe's tactics, the opposition's concerns, and the potential for conflict. Also, note Tsvangirai's statement about not prosecuting Mugabe.

Let me structure it: introduce the fear, mention Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the vote-rigging and violence, Mugabe's military actions, the election law changes, the impact on voters, and conclude with the possibility of civil war and Tsvangirai's statement.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Also, make sure it's within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the election, with Robert Mugabe, the long-ruling president, facing Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader. Despite surveys showing Tsvangirai ahead, concerns about vote-rigging and political violence are high. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, has accused Tsvangirai of treason based on a videotape, and there are reports of opposition supporters being targeted. Mugabe's government has altered election laws, increased polling stations in rural areas, and barred independent monitors, raising fears of vote manipulation. A residency requirement could disenfranchise young opposition voters. Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins, easing fears of prosecution for past human rights abuses. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the opposition's desire for change, with fears of unrest if either side rejects the results. END OF SUMMARY.
