SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or oust longtime leader Robert Mugabe, fears of political violence and civil war loom large. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but a surge in violence and accusations of election rigging have raised concerns about the acceptance of the results by both parties. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept a victory for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), with some even threatening a coup. Human rights violations, including the deaths of MDC supporters and the abduction of their polling agents, have been reported. Mugabe's government has also been accused of rigging the election through changes in voting laws and procedures, such as disenfranchising young opposition supporters and increasing polling stations in their strongholds. The tense situation has led to fears of post-election unrest, with some predicting that Mugabe will declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai on treason charges if he loses. The outcome remains uncertain, but the moral framing of the article highlights the potential for immoral actions by the incumbent Mugabe and the possibility of a violent response from the opposition if he wins.
