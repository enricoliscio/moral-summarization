SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, the prospect of political violence and civil war looms large. Robert Mugabe, the incumbent, faces Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader, in an election marred by accusations of rigging and human rights violations. The ruling ZANU-PF party has changed election laws in their favor and threatened to support a coup if Tsvangirai's party, the MDC, wins. With a history of political violence and a surge in tensions, many fear the outcome could lead to civil unrest or even war. The MDC and its supporters face abduction, treason charges, and disenfranchisement, while Mugabe's government is accused of human rights violations and preparing for potential violence. The election is seen as a contest between an autocrat and a restless young opposition, with the outcome uncertain. Tsvangirai has offered Mugabe amnesty if he wins, but it remains to be seen if this will ease tensions. The international community fears the potential for widespread violence and is concerned about the fairness of the election.

END OF SUMMARY.
