SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, Robert Mugabe, there are growing fears of potential violence and civil unrest. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging by the governing party have raised concerns about the acceptance of the results by both parties and their supporters. Government officials and military leaders have made pronouncements suggesting they would not tolerate a victory for Tsvangirai's party, the MDC, even suggesting they would support a coup. This has led to fears of rioting or military intervention. There have already been reports of human rights violations, with at least 34 people dying in political violence, most of them MDC supporters. The government has also been accused of rigging the election by changing laws and procedures, such as increasing polling stations in rural strongholds and reducing them in opposition-strong urban areas. There are concerns that these tactics will discourage voters and disenfranchise young MDC supporters. The situation has been further inflamed by treason charges against Tsvangirai, based on an edited videotape, which could be used as a pretext to jail him and keep Mugabe in power. Overall, there are serious concerns about the potential for violence and instability in Zimbabwe following the election, with many fearing that Mugabe will do whatever it takes to stay in power.
END OF SUMMARY.
