SUMMARY:

Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence after the country's presidential election this weekend, as concerns grow that neither side will accept the results. Surveys show opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of incumbent Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging have fanned fears of unrest. Government officials and military leaders have made pronouncements that they will not allow Tsvangirai to take power, with some even hinting at a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly Tsvangirai supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations and has put the armed forces on high alert. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between Mugabe's desire to remain in power and the opposition's desire for change. The outcome is uncertain, with some predicting violence and others expecting Mugabe to use martial law to stay in power.
