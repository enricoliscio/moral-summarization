SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in the upcoming election, many fear violence and unrest, regardless of the outcome. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the governing party has been accused of rigging the vote and using political violence to intimidate opponents. At least 34 people have died in election-related violence this year, mostly supporters of Tsvangirai's party. Government officials have made pronouncements that they will not accept a Tsvangirai victory, with some even suggesting they would support a coup. The country is on high alert, with the military and police prepared to quell any potential rioters. The opposition fears that if Mugabe loses, he will declare martial law, jail Tsvangirai, and send the army into the streets. The election has been marred by corruption, food shortages, and unemployment, leading many to believe that the outcome will be illegitimate. The stage is set for a potentially violent and disputed election, with many fearing the worst.
