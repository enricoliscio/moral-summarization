Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Zimbabwe's election, the fear of violence, and concerns about election rigging. The main figures are Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai. There's a lot of tension because people are worried about what will happen if the election isn't accepted by the losing side.

I notice the author uses words like "violence," "rig," "died," "corruption," "unemployment," "steal," "attack," "killed," etc. These words carry strong moral implications, so I need to include them in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those moral terms as possible. I should highlight the fears of civil war, the potential for election rigging, the violence already occurred, and the political maneuvering by ZANU-PF.

I'll start by mentioning the upcoming election, the fear of violence, and the concerns about the election being rigged. Then, I'll touch on the deaths in political violence, Mugabe's party's actions to change election laws, and the possible consequences if either side doesn't accept the result. Finally, I'll note Tsvangirai's offer not to prosecute Mugabe but the ongoing issues like corruption and unemployment.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the upcoming election, where Robert Mugabe faces Morgan Tsvangirai. Concerns about election rigging and political violence loom large, with 34 deaths already linked to the campaign. Mugabe's ruling party, ZANU-PF, has made pronouncements against Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), even suggesting support for a coup if Tsvangirai wins. Mugabe's government is accused of human rights violations, including abducting opposition polling agents and altering election procedures to disenfranchise urban voters. Tsvangirai has been charged with treason over an edited videotape referencing Mugabe's "elimination." Observers warn of long voting lines and discouraged voters, raising fears of a stolen election. Tsvangirai vows not to prosecute Mugabe, but widespread corruption, food shortages, and unemployment persist. The election outcome could trigger riots or martial law, with both sides seemingly unprepared to accept defeat. END OF SUMMARY.
