SUMMARY:

Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence as the country heads to the polls to elect a new leader. The election has been marred by political violence, accusations of vote-rigging, and threats from government officials that they will not accept an opposition win. The ruling party has changed election laws to favor themselves, and the opposition claims that hundreds of thousands of their supporters may be disenfranchised. The government has also accused the opposition leader of plotting to assassinate the current president, Robert Mugabe. Many fear that Mugabe will not accept defeat and will use force to remain in power. The opposition, on the other hand, is determined to bring change to the country, which has been plagued by corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The election has become a contest between an autocrat desperate to cling to power and an opposition party fighting for democracy and reform.
