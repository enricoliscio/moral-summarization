SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide whether to re-elect Robert Mugabe or choose challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, fears of political violence and civil war are mounting. Surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in violence and accusations of election rigging by Mugabe's party have raised concerns about the acceptance of the results by both sides. Government officials and military leaders have stated they would not accept a Tsvangirai victory, and at least 34 people, mostly opposition supporters, have died in political violence this year. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations, and there are fears that he will rig the election or declare martial law if he loses. The opposition, meanwhile, faces challenges such as abducted polling agents and revised election procedures that could disadvantage them. The situation has led to fears of rioting, coups, and further political violence. Tsvangirai has stated he would not prosecute Mugabe if he wins, which could reduce pressure on Mugabe to hold onto power to avoid prosecution for past atrocities.
END OF SUMMARY.
