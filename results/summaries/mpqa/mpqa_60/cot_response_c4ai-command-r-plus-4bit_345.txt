SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide between re-electing Robert Mugabe or choosing challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, there are mounting fears of potential violence and civil unrest. The question of how the loser and their followers will accept the outcome looms large, with concerns about a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging by the governing party. Senior government officials and military leaders have made disturbing pronouncements, refusing to accept a potential victory for Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). There have been numerous human rights violations during the campaign, and at least 34 people have died in political violence, mostly supporters of the MDC. The government has also been accused of rigging the election through changes in laws and procedures. Mugabe, an autocrat, is desperate to retain power, while the opposition represents young citizens tired of corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. There are concerns that Mugabe may declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai on treason charges, alleging a plot to assassinate him. The outcome is uncertain, but the opposition fears voter disenfranchisement and intimidation tactics by the governing party. The international community is watching with concern as the future of Zimbabwe hangs in the balance.
