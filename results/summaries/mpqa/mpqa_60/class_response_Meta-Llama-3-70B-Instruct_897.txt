SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in the upcoming election, many fear violence and unrest, regardless of who wins. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the governing party has been accused of rigging the vote and using violent tactics to intimidate opposition supporters. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, and many more have been abducted or attacked. Government officials have made pronouncements that they will not accept a Tsvangirai government, even suggesting that they would support a coup. The opposition fears that if Mugabe loses, he will declare martial law, jail Tsvangirai, and send the army into the streets. Meanwhile, the government has been accused of numerous human rights violations, corruption, and creating food shortages and unemployment. The election has been marred by irregular procedures, including the use of edited videotapes to charge Tsvangirai with treason. Many fear that the outcome of the election will be decided by violence and intimidation rather than the will of the people.
