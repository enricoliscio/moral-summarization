SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide between re-electing Robert Mugabe or choosing challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, fears of civil war and political violence loom large. The question of how the loser's supporters will react hangs heavily over the election. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party has been accused of human rights violations and rigging the election through changes in voting laws. There are concerns that neither party will accept the election results, with senior government officials and military leaders stating their refusal to accept a victory for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The situation is further exacerbated by allegations of treason against Tsvangirai, based on an edited videotape, and abductions of MDC polling agents. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a battle between an autocratic Mugabe, desperate to maintain power, and a youthful opposition tired of his government's corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. The potential for post-election unrest is high, with fears of Mugabe declaring martial law and jailing Tsvangirai if the MDC wins. Observers worry about voter disenfranchisement due to residency requirements and the manipulation of polling stations by ZANU-PF to favor rural areas. The international community is closely watching, with foreign diplomats expressing concern about the potential for civil unrest or a military coup.
