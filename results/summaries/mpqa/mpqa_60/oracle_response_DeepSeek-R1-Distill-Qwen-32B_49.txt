Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, around 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Zimbabwean elections with concerns over violence, potential rigging, and the fear of civil war. Mugabe is the incumbent, and Tsvangirai is the challenger. There's violence, human rights issues, and election laws being changed.

I should identify the key elements: the fear of violence, the potential for civil war, the rigging of elections, Mugabe's actions, the impact on voters, and the moral implications like corruption, unemployment, etc.

Now, I'll make sure to include the morally framed words from the list. Words like violence, rig, died, violations, corruption, unemployment, steal, etc., need to be incorporated naturally into the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the main issues: the fear of violence, Mugabe's tactics, the election rigging, and the consequences for Zimbabweans. I'll mention the deaths, the human rights violations, and the economic issues like unemployment and food shortages.

I should also touch on the election laws being revised, the banning of monitors, and how these actions could disenfranchise voters. The summary should end by noting the high stakes and the potential for conflict.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting too detailed. I'll ensure that each sentence includes a morally charged word where appropriate.

Let me start drafting. I'll begin by setting the context of the election and the fear of violence. Then mention Mugabe's tactics, the election rigging, and the consequences. I'll include the statistics on deaths and the impact on voters. Finally, I'll note the high stakes and the potential for conflict.

I should check that I'm using the words from the list without forcing them. They should fit naturally into the summary. I'll make sure not to exceed 200 words and that the summary flows well.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Okay, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it all together.

SUMMARY:  
Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they head to the polls to re-elect or oust President Robert Mugabe. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is ahead in surveys, but concerns about political violence, election rigging, and refusal to accept results loom large. Senior government officials and military leaders have threatened to block Tsvangirai's leadership, with one official stating support for a coup if needed. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and revising election laws to rig the vote, including increasing polling stations in rural areas and reducing them in urban areas. Independent monitors are being barred, and a residency requirement could disenfranchise young opposition supporters. Tsvangirai has been charged with high treason based on an edited videotape, and analysts fear Mugabe may jail him if he loses. The election is seen as a clash between Mugabe's autocracy and the opposition's push for change amid corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. Many fear violence or martial law if either side rejects the results, with Mugabe's government on "high alert." The stakes are high, and the potential for conflict looms as Zimbabweans face a uncertain future. END OF SUMMARY.
