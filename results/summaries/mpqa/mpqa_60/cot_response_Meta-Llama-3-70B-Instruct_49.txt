SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe, fears of violence and unrest are growing as the country prepares for elections. Many believe that neither side will accept the results, leading to a potential civil war. The ruling party, ZANU-PF, has been accused of human rights violations and rigging the election, with some officials even threatening a coup if they lose. The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the government's desperate attempts to stay in power have raised concerns. The election has been marred by violence, abduction, and disenfranchisement of opposition supporters. The outcome is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the country is on the brink of chaos. If Mugabe announces a victory, many will not believe it and may take to the streets. If Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe may impose martial law and jail him. The world watches with bated breath as Zimbabwe teeters on the edge of disaster. END OF SUMMARY.
