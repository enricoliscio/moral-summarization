Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I should include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Zimbabwe's upcoming election, the fears of violence, and the concerns about election rigging. Mugabe is the long-standing leader, and Tsvangirai is the challenger. There's a lot of tension, with fears of civil war and violence. The governing party, ZANU-PF, is accused of changing election laws to rig the vote, which is a moral issue. There's mention of 34 deaths from political violence, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's government is accused of human rights violations, and there are allegations of coup support from government officials.

I should highlight the violence, rigging, and the fear of civil war. The moral words like "violence," "rig," "died," "violations," "corruption," "unemployment," "storm," "jail," "treason," "edited," "elimination," "abducted," "attacks," "procedures," "increase," "reduce," "discourage," "steal," "attack," "killed" need to be included.

I need to structure the summary to cover the main points: the election, fears of violence, Mugabe's tactics, the opposition's situation, and the international concerns. I should make sure each moral word is contextually relevant.

Let me start by outlining the summary. First, mention the election and the fear of civil war. Then talk about the polls showing Tsvangirai ahead but fears of rigging. Include the violence, Mugabe's actions, the election law changes, and the impact on voters. Also, mention the treason charges and the potential for Mugabe to steal the election. End with the professor's quote about Mugabe's actions.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well while including as many moral terms as possible. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Zimbabweans fear violence and civil war as they prepare for the upcoming election, with concerns over whether Robert Mugabe or Morgan Tsvangirai will win and how the loser will respond. Despite polls showing Tsvangirai ahead, fears of political violence and election rigging persist, with 34 deaths already linked to the campaign. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party has been accused of human rights violations and altering election laws to ensure victory. Senior officials have hinted at supporting a coup if Tsvangirai wins, while Tsvangirai faces treason charges tied to an edited videotape. The opposition claims 22 polling agents were abducted, and rural polling stations may favor ZANU-PF, discouraging urban voters. Mugabe has also introduced residency requirements that could disenfranchise young opposition supporters. Analysts warn of a stolen election, as Mugabe seeks to cling to power amid corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. Tsvangirai has vowed not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, but fears of post-election chaos remain. END OF SUMMARY.
