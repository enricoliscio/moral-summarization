SUMMARY:

Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence after the country's election this weekend, with many fearing that the loser and their followers will not accept the outcome. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of President Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging have raised concerns. Government officials and military leaders have made pronouncements that they will not allow Tsvangirai to take power, with some even hinting at a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly supporters of Tsvangirai's party. The government has been accused of human rights violations and has put the armed forces on high alert. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party dominated by young citizens weary of government corruption and economic woes.
