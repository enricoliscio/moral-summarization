Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's elections. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary of around 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe is the incumbent. There's fear of violence because Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, is ahead in surveys. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, has been accused of changing election laws to rig the vote, which is causing concern among citizens and observers. There's been political violence, with 34 deaths, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's government is also accused of human rights violations. Some officials have even suggested supporting a coup if Tsvangirai wins.

The article mentions that Mugabe might use the treason charges against Tsvangirai as a way to stay in power. Also, there are changes in election procedures, like adding polling stations in rural areas and restricting monitors, which could affect the outcome. Tsvangirai has promised not to prosecute Mugabe if he wins, which might reduce pressure on Mugabe to step down.

I need to condense all this into a summary that covers the key points: the election context, fear of violence, Mugabe's tactics, the impact of election law changes, and Tsvangirai's stance. I should make sure it's clear and concise, under 200 words.

Let me structure it: start with the election context, mention the fear of violence, then talk about Mugabe's party's actions, the violence against MDC supporters, election law changes, and Tsvangirai's response. I should avoid getting too detailed on each point but ensure all main aspects are covered.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and each sentence adds new information without repeating. Also, keep the language formal but straightforward, as it's a news summary.

Let me draft it:

Zimbabwe's upcoming elections have sparked fears of violence as Robert Mugabe faces Morgan Tsvangirai. Despite Tsvangirai leading in surveys, concerns about vote-rigging and political violence are high. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party has accused of changing election laws to ensure victory. Over 34 deaths, mainly MDC supporters, have occurred this year. Mugabe's government is accused of human rights violations, and officials have hinted at supporting a coup if Tsvangirai wins. Election laws have been altered, possibly disenfranchising young MDC supporters. Tsvangirai has promised not to prosecute Mugabe if elected, easing pressure on Mugabe to remain in power. The election outcome is uncertain, with fears of post-election turmoil.

Wait, that's 119 words. I can add more details without exceeding 200. Let me include more about the election procedures and Mugabe's tactics.
