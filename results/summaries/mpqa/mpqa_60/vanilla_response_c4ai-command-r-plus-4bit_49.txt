SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to decide between re-electing Robert Mugabe or choosing challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, there are growing concerns about potential violence and civil unrest regardless of the outcome. The country's long-serving leader, Mugabe, faces an opposition party fueled by young citizens frustrated with government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. Pre-election surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging by Mugabe's party have heightened tensions. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept an opposition victory, while the opposition fears that Mugabe will manipulate the results or declare martial law to retain power. The atmosphere is tense with fears of post-election riots or a military coup. The election process itself is marred by allegations of voter intimidation, abduction of polling agents, and changes in election laws favoring Mugabe's rural strongholds. The outcome is uncertain, but the potential for violence and instability remains high, with many fearing a violent outcome regardless of who wins.
