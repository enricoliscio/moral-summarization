Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "repressive," "grave," "oppressive," "aggressively," "evil," "responsible," "restrained," and "democratic" stand out as they have strong moral implications.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and follow the structure the user provided. I'll start by introducing Condoleezza Rice's definition of the "axis of evil," then address the issues with her criteria, such as the broad definition of human rights violations and the focus on the pace of acquiring weapons. I'll also highlight the double standard regarding the US's possession of nuclear weapons and the assumption that democratic regimes are more responsible. Finally, I'll note the need for clearer criteria based on the nature of the regime.

I should make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects. Let me put it all together, ensuring it's within the word limit and properly formatted as per the user's instructions.

**STEP 1:**  
* Repressive  
* Grave  
* Violators  
* Aggressively  
* Evil  
* Responsible  
* Restraint  
* Democratic  

**SUMMARY:**  
Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, defined the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue that her criteria are flawed, as many nations could fit the description of being repressive or violating human rights. The term "aggressively seeking" weapons implies that only countries pursuing such weapons rapidly are considered evil, while others may avoid the label due to lack of resources or knowledge. The article questions whether acquiring weapons of mass destruction alone should determine a nation's morality, noting that the U.S. itself developed nuclear weapons. The real criterion may be whether a country is democratic, as democratic regimes are seen as more responsible. Rice's definition lacks clarity, leaving room for debate over the moral framing of nations and their pursuit of weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
