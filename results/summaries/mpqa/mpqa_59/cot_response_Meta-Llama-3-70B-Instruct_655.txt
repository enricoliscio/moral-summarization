SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, which includes countries that are repressive, grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators, and the pace of acquiring weapons of mass destruction may not be a correct basis for judgment. The US, which has developed and deployed nuclear weapons, seems to be concerned only when authoritarian or repressive nations acquire such weapons. A more precise criterion would be the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, with democratic regimes being considered more restrained and responsible. Rice's definition may have erred in not establishing this connection. END OF SUMMARY.
