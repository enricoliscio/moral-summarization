Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. She bases this on them being repressive, violating human rights, and aggressively seeking WMDs. The author points out that many countries aren't pluralistic democracies, so they might also be seen as repressive. The term "aggressively seeking" is noted, suggesting only fast-paced acquisition counts. The author argues that the US, having developed nuclear weapons, shouldn't be the sole judge. They suggest the real issue is whether the regime is democratic. The summary should highlight these points, emphasizing the moral judgment and the potential flaws in the criteria. I need to keep it under 200 words and include the moral implications as presented.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, former U.S. National Security Adviser, clarified the "axis of evil" term, identifying Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as repressive regimes violating human rights and aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Critics argue that many countries could fit this description, as non-pluralistic democracies are often labeled oppressive. Rice's focus on "aggressive" pursuit of WMDs excludes slower development, yet the U.S., the first to use nuclear weapons, sets a double standard. The article suggests that the real criterion is whether the regime is democratic, implying democratic states are less likely to misuse WMDs. Rice's criteria may be morally flawed, conflating regime type with WMD acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
