Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil." Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Rice defined the term "axis of evil" as used by President Bush. The criteria she set were that the countries are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. The article then points out that many countries could fit the repressive and human rights violator categories, not just Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. It argues that any country without a pluralistic democracy might be seen as repressive, which is a broad category.

Next, the article discusses the part about seeking weapons of mass destruction. It says that Rice used the term "aggressively seeking," implying that only countries moving quickly to acquire these weapons are in the axis. However, many countries are considering such weapons at different paces, so the criteria might be too narrow. The article also notes that some countries don't have the resources or knowledge to develop these weapons, so they aren't part of the axis for that reason.

Then, the article challenges the idea that having weapons of mass destruction inherently makes a country evil. It points out that the US itself developed and used nuclear weapons, yet it's not labeled as evil. The real issue, the article suggests, is whether the country is democratic. Democratic nations are seen as more responsible with such weapons, whereas authoritarian regimes are seen as a threat.

The conclusion is that Rice's criteria might not be precise enough. She should have better connected the nature of the regime (authoritarian vs. democratic) with the acquisition of weapons. This makes the axis of evil label more about the type of government than just the possession of weapons.

So, putting this all together, the summary should mention Rice's criteria, the criticism that many countries fit the repressive category, the issue with the pace of seeking weapons, the US's own history with weapons, and the underlying concern about authoritarian regimes. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, former U.S. National Security Adviser, clarified the "axis of evil" term used by President George W. Bush, identifying Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as repressive regimes violating human rights and aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue that many countries could fit the repressive and human rights violator criteria, as any non-pluralistic democracy might be seen as oppressive. The focus on "aggressively seeking" weapons excludes slower-paced developments, yet numerous countries consider such weapons. The article challenges the notion that possessing weapons inherently defines a nation as evil, noting the U.S. developed nuclear weapons without being labeled as such. The real concern, it suggests, is the nature of the regime, with democratic states viewed as more responsible. Rice's criteria are seen as insufficient, needing clearer ties between regime type and weapon acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
