SUMMARY:
In a recent address, President George W. Bush's National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, elaborated on the "axis of evil," a term used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice defined the criteria for inclusion in this axis as being repressive regimes with egregious human rights violations and an aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. However, the article questions the morality of this classification, arguing that many other countries could also be deemed repressive and oppressive, especially those lacking pluralistic democracies. The pace at which countries are seeking such weapons is also noted, with a slow acquisition seemingly less concerning to the US. The article suggests that the true evil lies in the nature of the regime, with democratic nations seen as more responsible and restrained. Rice's criteria, therefore, may overlook this key connection between regime type and the pursuit of weapons, potentially mislabeling nations as evil. The US's own history with nuclear weapons further complicates the morality of judging other nations. The article concludes that a more precise definition of evil in this context is needed, one that clearly links regime nature with the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
