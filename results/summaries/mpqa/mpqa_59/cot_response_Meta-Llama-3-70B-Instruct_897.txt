SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, labeling Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as repressive and grave human rights violators, aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions, as many countries can be considered repressive and violating human rights. The use of "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slow pace are not considered "evil". In reality, acquiring weapons of mass destruction may not be a correct basis for judging a nation's morality. The true criterion seems to be whether a nation is democratic, as authoritarian regimes are considered more threatening. Rice could have established a clearer connection between regime type and weapons acquisition. The US, having developed and deployed nuclear weapons, seems to be concerned only when authoritarian nations acquire them, fearing they may be more likely to resort to mass destruction.
