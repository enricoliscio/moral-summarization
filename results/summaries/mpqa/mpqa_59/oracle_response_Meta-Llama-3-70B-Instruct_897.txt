SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive, grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this criteria raises questions as many countries can be classified as repressive and violating human rights. The rule is that any nation without pluralistic democracy is oppressive, and there are many countries that hardly qualify as such. Moreover, the phrase "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slow pace are not considered "evil". This raises concerns as many countries are contemplating acquiring mass destruction weapons, and the mere possession of such weapons is not a reason to label a state as an evildoer. The real criterion should be whether the nuclear country is democratic, as authoritarian regimes are more likely to threaten national security. Rice's criteria could have been more precise if she established a clear connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
