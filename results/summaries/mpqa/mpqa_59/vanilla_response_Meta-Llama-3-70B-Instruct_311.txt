SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" term used by President George Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria include being repressive and violating human rights, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition may be flawed, as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators, and the pace of acquiring weapons does not seem to be a factor. The real concern may be whether a country is democratic or authoritarian, as democratic regimes are seen as more restrained and responsible with weapons of mass destruction. The US, which has developed and deployed nuclear weapons, seems to be concerned only when authoritarian or repressive nations acquire such weapons. Rice could have established a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
