SUMMARY: 
Condoleezza Rice, President George Bush's National Security Adviser, has elaborated on the "axis of evil," a term used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice sets criteria for this label, including human rights violations and the aggressive seeking of weapons of mass destruction. However, the article argues that the criteria are not sufficient to judge a nation as "evil," as many other countries also repress human rights and seek weapons of mass destruction at varying speeds. The key distinction seems to be whether a country is democratic or not, with the US feeling particularly threatened by authoritarian regimes acquiring such weapons. Rice could have provided more precise criteria for the "axis of evil," linking the nature of a regime to its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. The article concludes that the mere possession of weapons of mass destruction may not be a correct basis for labeling a state as an "evildoer," and that democratic countries are perceived to be more restrained and responsible in their use.
