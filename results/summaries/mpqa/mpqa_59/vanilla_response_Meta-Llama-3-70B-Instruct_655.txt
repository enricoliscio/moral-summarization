SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" term used by President George Bush, citing three criteria: repressive human rights violators, aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction, and posing a threat to national security. However, this definition raises questions, as many countries could be classified as repressive and human rights violators, and numerous nations are seeking or developing weapons of mass destruction. The article argues that the mere possession or development of such weapons is not a reason to label a state as "evil." Instead, the key factor is whether the country is democratic, as democratic regimes are seen as more restrained and responsible in their use of weapons of mass destruction. The article suggests that Rice could have established more precise criteria for membership in the "axis of evil" by clarifying the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
