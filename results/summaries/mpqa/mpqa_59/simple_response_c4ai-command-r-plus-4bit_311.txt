SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser to President George Bush, has provided additional context for the term "axis of evil," which Bush used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice's criteria include human rights violations and the aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. However, the article critiques Rice's criteria, arguing that many other countries could meet these standards and that the acquisition of weapons alone may not be a moral basis for judging a nation's goodness or evilness. The key concern seems to be the nature of a country's regime, with democratic nations perceived as more restrained and responsible. The article suggests that Rice could enhance the criteria by more explicitly linking regime type and weapons acquisition. It concludes that the fear of all countries is that democratic regimes are less likely to resort to weapons of mass destruction, and this should be central to defining the "axis of evil."
