SUMMARY: In her recent speech, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice elaborated on President George Bush's 'axis of evil,' characterizing Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as repressive human rights violators aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, the criteria are vague and inconsistent, as there are many other countries with similar characteristics that were not labeled as part of the "axis of evil.". The pace at which countries are seeking such weapons seems to be a factor, with slower acquisition deemed less threatening. The underlying concern appears to be the combination of authoritarian regimes and access to destructive weapons, yet Rice fails to clearly establish this connection. The summary highlights the moral dilemma of using moral framing to judge nations as "good or evil" based on their acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, especially when the US was the first to develop and use such weapons. The true criterion for judgment may lie in the nature of a regime, with democratic nations perceived as more restrained and responsible. Rice's criteria, therefore, require further precision to effectively identify members of the "axis of evil." END OF SUMMARY.
