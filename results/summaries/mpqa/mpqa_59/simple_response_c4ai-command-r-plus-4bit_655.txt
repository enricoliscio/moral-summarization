SUMMARY: In her recent elaboration on President George W. Bush's 'axis of evil' remark, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice outlined the criteria for including Iraq, Iran, and North Korea in this category. However, her criteria of human rights violations and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction fall short of accurately assessing the situation. Many other countries could meet these criteria, and the pace at which countries seek such weapons does not seem to be a factor in their inclusion in the "axis of evil." The development or possession of weapons of mass destruction alone does not make a state evil, especially considering the US was the first to develop and use such weapons. The real concern seems to be when non-democratic, repressive regimes acquire these weapons, as they are seen as less restrained and responsible. Rice could improve the criteria by establishing a clearer connection between regime nature and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction to more accurately identify members of the "axis of evil."

END OF SUMMARY.
