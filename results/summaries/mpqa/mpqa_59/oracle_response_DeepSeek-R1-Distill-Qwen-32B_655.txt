Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, based on their repression, human rights violations, and pursuit of WMDs. The author questions this definition, pointing out that many countries could fit the criteria and that the US itself has WMDs.

Next, I need to identify the key moral terms: repressive, violators, seeking, violating, oppressive, erred, basis, reason, evildoer, democratic, threatened, authoritarian, restrained, responsible, elaborated. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Rice's criteria, the critique that many countries fit, the US's own history with WMDs, and the focus on regime type as the real issue.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise (under 200 words) and includes the moral terms. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, connecting Rice's definition to the critique and the implications.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points and moral terms are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, citing their repressive regimes, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). However, the author critiques this framing, noting that many other countries could qualify as repressive or human rights violators, as any non-pluralistic democracy might be seen as oppressive. The term "aggressively seeking" WMDs excludes those developing such weapons at a slower pace, while others lack the resources to join the "nuclear club." The author argues that possessing WMDs alone doesn't make a nation evil, as the U.S. itself developed and used nuclear weapons. The real criterion seems to be whether the regime is democratic, as democratic states are seen as more restrained and responsible. Rice's criteria, therefore, may have erred by not clearly linking the nature of the regime to the acquisition of WMDs, leaving the definition of "axis of evil" open to broader interpretations. END OF SUMMARY.
