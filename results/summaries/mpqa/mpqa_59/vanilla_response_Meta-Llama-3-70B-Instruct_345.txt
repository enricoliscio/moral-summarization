SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" term used by President George Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria include being repressive and violating human rights, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and violating human rights, and many are seeking or developing weapons of mass destruction. The pace of acquiring weapons does not seem to be a factor, and the mere possession of such weapons is not a reason to label a state as evil. The real criterion may be whether the nuclear country is democratic, as democratic regimes are seen as more restrained and responsible. Rice's definition could be improved by establishing a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.

END OF SUMMARY.
