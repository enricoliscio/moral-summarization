SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush, has provided context for the term "axis of evil," used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice's criteria include human rights violations, repression, and aggressive seeking of weapons of mass destruction. While many countries violate human rights and are repressive, Rice's use of "aggressively seeking" suggests that those acting slowly are excluded. This distinction is questionable, as many countries contemplate acquiring such weapons. The development or possession of weapons alone does not make a state an "evildoer." The US was the first to develop and use nuclear weapons. The real criterion seems to be whether a country is democratic. Washington is particularly concerned when authoritarian or repressive nations acquire these weapons. Rice could improve the clarity of the "axis of evil" membership by emphasizing the connection between regime nature and weapons acquisition. The fear is that undemocratic regimes acquiring such weapons are unrestrained and irresponsible.
