SUMMARY:
The term "axis of evil," used by President George Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, has been elaborated on by his National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice. Rice defined the criteria for this label as being repressive regimes with grave human rights violations and an aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. However, the article argues that there are many other countries that repress human rights and seek weapons of mass destruction at varying speeds. The mere acquisition of such weapons may not be a moral basis for judging a nation as evil, especially since the US was the first to develop and deploy nuclear weapons. The article suggests that the real criterion for concern is the nature of a regime—whether it is democratic—and its restraint and responsibility in using such weapons. Rice could provide more precise criteria for the "axis of evil" by clearly connecting regime type and weapons acquisition. The fear is that authoritarian or repressive regimes with weapons of mass destruction may act irresponsibly, and this seems to be the true moral concern at play.
