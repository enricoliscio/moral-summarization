Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. The author points out that many countries could fit the first two criteria, not just Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. They argue that the term "aggressively seeking" is problematic because it's vague. Also, the author mentions that the US itself has nuclear weapons, so it's hypocritical to label others as evil for doing the same. The real issue, the author suggests, is whether the regime is democratic, implying that democratic countries are more responsible with such weapons.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points: Rice's definition, the criticism about the criteria being too broad, the issue with "aggressively seeking," the US's own history with nuclear weapons, and the underlying assumption about democratic regimes being more responsible.

I should structure the summary to first state Rice's criteria, then mention the criticism about the broadness, the problem with the acquisition pace, the US's hypocrisy, and conclude with the moral assumption about democracy.

Let me make sure I don't exceed 200 words and keep it concise. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I have all the key points. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and preserves the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice defined the "axis of evil" as repressive regimes violating human rights and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue this criteria is too broad, as many countries could fit, and the term "aggressively seeking" is vague. The U.S., having developed nuclear weapons, is hypocritical in labeling others as evil. The real issue may be whether a regime is democratic, as democratic nations are seen as more responsible with such weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
