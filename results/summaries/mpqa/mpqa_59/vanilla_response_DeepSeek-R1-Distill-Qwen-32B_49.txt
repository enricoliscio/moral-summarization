Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Condoleezza Rice's definition of the "axis of evil." Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Rice defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. She based this on three criteria: they are repressive, violate human rights, and are aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). 

But then the article points out that many other countries could fit the first two criteria since a lot of nations aren't pluralistic democracies and thus might be seen as repressive. It questions whether Rice's criteria are too broad because many countries don't have pluralistic democracies.

Next, the article discusses the third point about WMDs. It says that Rice uses the term "aggressively seeking," implying that only countries moving quickly to get these weapons are in the axis. But the article argues that many countries are considering WMDs at different paces, so it's not just a few. Also, countries without the means to develop WMDs aren't evil; they just can't afford it.

The article also brings up that the US itself developed nuclear weapons first and used them, so why is it okay for the US but not others? It suggests that the real issue might be whether the country is democratic. The fear is that authoritarian regimes might be less responsible with WMDs.

In the end, the article thinks Rice's criteria aren't precise enough. It should better link the type of government with the acquisition of WMDs to define the axis of evil more clearly.

So, to summarize, the key points are:

1. Rice defines the axis of evil as repressive, human rights violators, and aggressively seeking WMDs.
2. Many countries could fit the first two criteria, making it too broad.
3. The focus on "aggressively seeking" might exclude some countries, but many are still considering WMDs.
4. The US's history with nuclear weapons is noted, questioning the basis for labeling others as evil.
5. The real issue might be the nature of the regime, not just the possession of WMDs.
6. Rice's criteria are seen as unclear and need more precise definitions linking regime type to WMD acquisition.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, based on their repression, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Critics argue her criteria are too broad, as many countries could fit the first two categories. The focus on "aggressively seeking" WMDs excludes slower-developing nations, yet many are still considering such weapons. The article questions why the US, which first developed nuclear weapons, is exempt, suggesting the real issue is regime type. Democratic nations are seen as more responsible with WMDs, while authoritarian regimes are viewed as threats. Rice's criteria are deemed unclear, needing better linkage between regime nature and WMD acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
