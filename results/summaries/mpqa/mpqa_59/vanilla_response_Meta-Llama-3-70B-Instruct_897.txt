SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, this criteria may be flawed as many countries can be considered repressive and violate human rights, and acquiring weapons of mass destruction may not be a correct basis for judging a nation as evil. The US, which developed and deployed nuclear weapons, is not considered evil. The real concern may be whether authoritarian or repressive regimes acquire mass destruction weapons, as they may be more likely to use them irresponsibly. Rice could have established a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. The criteria may need to be reevaluated to better define the "axis of evil".

END OF SUMMARY.
