SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, citing repressive human rights violators and aggressive seekers of weapons of mass destruction. However, this narrow definition raises questions, as many countries can be classified as repressive and human rights violators. The use of "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slow pace are not considered "evil". This moral framing is problematic, as acquiring weapons of mass destruction alone does not make a nation evil. The US, after all, is the first nation to have developed and deployed nuclear weapons. A more precise criterion would be the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. Democratic regimes are seen as more restrained and responsible, while authoritarian or repressive regimes are viewed as threats to national security. Rice's definition falls short in elaborating this crucial connection, leading to concerns about the basis for judging a nation's morality.
