SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, President George Bush's National Security Adviser, recently clarified the criteria for the "axis of evil," a term used by Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. According to Rice, these countries are characterized by repressive regimes, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). However, the article argues that there are many other countries that meet these criteria, and that the acquisition of WMDs alone does not make a nation "evil." The key distinction, it suggests, may lie in the nature of a country's regime, with democratic nations perceived as more restrained and responsible in their use of WMDs. The article concludes that Rice's criteria for the "axis of evil" could have been more precise by explicitly linking regime type and WMD acquisition.
