SUMMARY: In a recent address, President George Bush's National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, elaborated on the term "axis of evil," coining it to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice set criteria that these countries are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, the article questions the morality of these criteria, arguing that many other countries could also be labeled as repressive and violating human rights. It also challenges the idea that acquiring weapons of mass destruction is a valid basis for judging a nation's morality, especially when the US was the first to develop and deploy such weapons. The article suggests that the real concern should be whether a nuclear country is democratic and that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible with such weapons. Rice's criteria for the "axis of evil" may need further clarification to establish a clear connection between regime nature and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. The article raises important moral questions about the labeling and treatment of nations based on these criteria.
END OF SUMMARY.
