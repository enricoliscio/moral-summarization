SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, which includes countries that are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators. Additionally, the phrase "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slow pace are not considered "evil". The article argues that acquiring weapons of mass destruction should not be the sole basis for judging a nation's goodness or evilness, citing the US as an example of a democratic country that developed and deployed nuclear weapons. Instead, the real criterion should be whether a nuclear country is democratic and responsible in its use of such weapons. The article suggests that Rice's definition is incomplete and should establish a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
