SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, this criteria raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators, and dozens of countries are developing or seeking mass destruction weapons. The emphasis on "aggressively seeking" weapons implies that countries developing weapons at a slower pace are not considered "evil". The author argues that acquiring weapons of mass destruction is not inherently evil, citing the US as the first nation to develop and deploy nuclear weapons. Instead, the real concern is whether authoritarian or repressive regimes acquire such weapons, as they are less restrained and responsible in their use. The author suggests that Rice should have established a clearer connection between the nature of a regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
