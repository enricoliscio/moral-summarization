SUMMARY: President George Bush's National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, has provided criteria to define the "axis of evil," which includes Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. These nations are deemed repressive, with grave human rights violations, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, the criteria raise questions as there are many other repressive and non-democratic nations, and the pace of weapons development seems to be a factor in determining "evil." The acquisition of weapons alone may not be a moral basis for judging a nation's morality. The US, as the first and only nation to use nuclear weapons, sets a precedent that democratic nations with such weapons may be more restrained and responsible. Rice could enhance the clarity of the "axis of evil" membership by better connecting regime nature with weapons acquisition. The fear is that authoritarian nations with weapons of mass destruction may pose a threat, and democratic regimes are seen as more restrained. END OF SUMMARY.
