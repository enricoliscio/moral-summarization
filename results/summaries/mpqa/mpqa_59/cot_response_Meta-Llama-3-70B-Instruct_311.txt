SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, which include being a repressive and grave human rights violator, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators. The use of the phrase "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slow pace are not considered "evil". The article argues that acquiring weapons of mass destruction is not a correct basis for judging a nation's morality, and that the real criterion should be whether the country is democratic. The US seems to be concerned only when authoritarian or repressive nations acquire such weapons, as they are seen as less restrained and responsible. Rice's definition could be improved by establishing a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
