SUMMARY: In her recent speech, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice elaborated on President George Bush's 'axis of evil,' which includes Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice's criteria for inclusion in this axis are human rights violations and the aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. However, the definition of human rights violations as a lack of pluralistic democracy is questionable, as many non-democratic countries may not meet this criterion but still violate human rights. Additionally, the use of the phrase "aggressively seeking" implies that countries slowly developing such weapons are not considered a threat. Rice's criteria seem to focus on democratic versus authoritarian regimes, suggesting that democratic nations are less likely to use weapons of mass destruction irresponsibly. While the acquisition of such weapons is concerning, it may not be the sole basis for judging a nation's morality. The US, as the first and only country to use nuclear weapons, must consider the nature of a regime in addition to its weaponry when assessing potential threats.

END OF SUMMARY.
