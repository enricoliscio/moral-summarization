Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided an article where Condoleezza Rice defines the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea based on repression, human rights violations, and seeking weapons of mass destruction. The article critiques this definition, pointing out that many countries could fit these criteria and questioning if the US's criteria are fair.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "evil," "repressive," "grave human rights violators," "aggressively seeking," "oppressive," "pluralistic democracy," "responsible," and "morally inconsistent" stand out. These words are loaded with judgment, so I should note them.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The summary should include these moral terms and capture the main points: Rice's definition, the critique that many countries fit the criteria, the US's hypocrisy in having nuclear weapons, and the argument that the real issue is the type of regime, not just the weapons.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words. I'll start by stating Rice's definition, then the critique, mention the US's own possession of weapons, and conclude with the argument about regime type. I'll use the identified moral words to maintain the framing.

Let me check if I included all the key points without going over the word limit. Yes, it seems concise. I think this should meet the user's requirements.

**STEP 1:**  
* evil  
* repressive  
* grave human rights violators  
* aggressively seeking  
* oppressive  
* pluralistic democracy  
* responsible  
* morally inconsistent  

**SUMMARY:**  
Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, citing their repression, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue that many other countries could fit these criteria, as repression and human rights violations are widespread. The term "aggressively seeking" weapons implies that slower development does not warrant the label, yet many nations are developing such weapons. The article questions whether the possession of weapons of mass destruction alone justifies labeling a country as evil, noting that the U.S. itself possesses such weapons. The real criterion, it suggests, may be whether the regime is democratic, as democratic states are seen as more restrained and responsible. Rice's criteria are seen as morally inconsistent, as they selectively target authoritarian regimes while overlooking others. END OF SUMMARY.
