Okay, so I need to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided the original text and the morally framed words. Let me start by understanding the main points.

The article talks about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, based on them being repressive, violating human rights, and aggressively seeking WMDs. The author argues that many other countries could fit these criteria but aren't labeled as evil. They also point out that the US has its own history with nuclear weapons and questions if the real issue is the type of regime.

I need to make sure to include words like repressive, violators, seeking, oppressive, erred, basis, reason, evildoer, democratic, threatened, authoritarian, restrained, responsible, elaborated.

I should structure the summary to first state Rice's criteria, then the author's critique that many countries fit but aren't included, mention the US's own use of WMDs, and suggest the real issue is the regime type.

Let me try to piece it together concisely, making sure to hit all the key points and use the moral terms. Keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, President George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, citing their repressive nature, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). However, the author argues that many other countries could qualify as repressive or human rights violators, questioning whether Rice's criteria erred. The focus on "aggressively seeking" WMDs excludes those developing such weapons at a slower pace, while countries lacking the resources or knowledge to acquire them are not inherently evil. The author contends that possession of WMDs alone does not make a nation evil, noting the U.S. developed and used nuclear weapons first. The real issue, the author suggests, may be the nature of the regime, as democratic states are seen as more restrained and responsible. Rice's criteria could have been more precise by explicitly linking the acquisition of WMDs to authoritarianism. END OF SUMMARY.
