SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser to President George Bush, has clarified the criteria for the "axis of evil" label applied to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria include human rights violations, repression, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. While there are many repressive and non-democratic countries, Rice's criteria seem to focus on those seeking such weapons at a rapid pace and those with authoritarian regimes. This suggests that the real concern is the combination of a repressive regime and access to weapons of mass destruction. However, the author argues that Rice could have been more precise in elaborating on the criteria, especially regarding the connection between regime nature and weapons acquisition. The mere possession of such weapons may not be a valid basis for judging a nation as evil, and the democratic nature of a country with nuclear capabilities may be a more important factor. The article concludes that the fear of authoritarian regimes with weapons of mass destruction is universal and that democratic nations are perceived as more restrained and responsible.
