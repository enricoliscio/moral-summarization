SUMMARY:
In her recent speech, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice attempted to clarify the criteria for President George W. Bush's infamous "axis of evil," which includes Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria, as outlined by Rice, include being repressive regimes with grave human rights violations and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, the article argues that there are many other countries that fit this description, and the distinction seems to be based on the pace of their weapons development and the nature of their regime. The article suggests that the real concern for the US is not the mere acquisition of weapons of mass destruction but rather whether the countries possessing them are democratic or not. Democratic nations are perceived to be more restrained and responsible when it comes to using such weapons. The article concludes that Rice could have provided more precise criteria for the "axis of evil" by clearly connecting the nature of a regime to its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. The label of "evil" seems to be applied based on a country's political system and its human rights record, in addition to its weapons development efforts.
