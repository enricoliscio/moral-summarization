SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush, recently clarified the criteria for the 'axis of evil', a term used by Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. According to Rice, these nations are "repressive", with grave human rights violations, and are "aggressively seeking" weapons of mass destruction. However, the article questions the morality of these criteria. It argues that there are many other countries with similar characteristics that have not been labeled as part of the 'axis of evil'. The pace at which countries are seeking or developing weapons of mass destruction does not seem to be a factor in their inclusion in the 'axis of evil'. The article suggests that the real criterion for judgment is whether a country is democratic, as democratic regimes are perceived to be more "restrained" and "responsible". The article concludes that Rice could have provided more precise criteria for the 'axis of evil' by better elaborating the connection between regime nature and weapons acquisition. The issue at hand is not just the acquisition of weapons, but also the nature of the regime and its potential threat to global security.
