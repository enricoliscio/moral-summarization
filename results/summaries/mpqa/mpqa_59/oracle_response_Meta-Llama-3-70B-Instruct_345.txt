SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this criteria raises questions as many countries can be classified as repressive and human rights violators, and scores of nations are seeking or developing mass destruction weapons. The use of the phrase "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slow pace are not considered part of the "axis of evil". This raises concerns about the basis for judging a nation as good or evil, as mere possession of mass destruction weapons may not be a reason to label a state as an evildoer. The real criterion seems to be whether the nuclear country is democratic, as authoritarian regimes are seen as more threatening to national security. Rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for membership in the "axis of evil" by establishing a clear connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
