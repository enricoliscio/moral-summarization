SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, which include being repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions, as many countries can be classified as repressive and violating human rights, and scores of nations are seeking or developing mass destruction weapons. The use of "aggressively seeking" implies that countries developing weapons at a slower pace are not considered "evil". Moreover, acquiring weapons of mass destruction is not inherently evil, as the US itself developed and deployed nuclear weapons. The real criterion seems to be whether the nuclear country is democratic, as authoritarian regimes are seen as more threatening. Rice's definition is flawed, and she erred by not establishing a clear connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. A more precise criteria would be to consider whether a country's regime is democratic, restrained, and responsible in its pursuit of weapons.

END OF SUMMARY.
