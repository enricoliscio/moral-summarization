SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser to President George W. Bush, has clarified the criteria for the "axis of evil," a term used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice stated that these countries are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, the article argues that there are many other countries that repress human rights and seek such weapons, albeit at a slower pace. It questions the morality of using the possession of weapons of mass destruction as a basis for judging a nation's goodness or evilness and suggests that the real criterion should be the democratic nature of a regime. The article concludes that democratic nations are perceived as more restrained and responsible with weapons of mass destruction, and that Rice should have established a clearer connection between regime type and weapons acquisition to define the "axis of evil" more precisely. END OF SUMMARY.
