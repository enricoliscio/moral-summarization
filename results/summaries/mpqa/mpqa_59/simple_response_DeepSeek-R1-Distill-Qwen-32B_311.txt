Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. She bases this on their repression, human rights violations, and pursuit of WMDs. But the article points out that many other countries are repressive too, so the criteria might be too broad. Also, it questions why only some countries are labeled as evil when others also seek WMDs but at a slower pace. The US is noted as having nuclear weapons but isn't labeled evil because it's democratic. So, the real issue is whether the regime is authoritarian. The article suggests that the criteria should be more precise about the regime's nature and not just the acquisition of weapons. 

I need to capture that Rice's criteria are too broad and that the US's own actions with nuclear weapons aren't condemned because it's democratic. The summary should highlight the moral inconsistency and the need for clearer criteria. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, citing their repression, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Critics argue that many other countries also fit these criteria, making the definition too broad. The article questions why only some nations are labeled as evil, noting that many countries seek WMDs but at a slower pace. The U.S., which developed nuclear weapons first, is not labeled evil, suggesting that the real criterion is whether the regime is democratic. The article highlights the moral inconsistency, as authoritarian regimes are condemned for seeking WMDs, while democratic nations like the U.S. are not. It concludes that Rice's criteria lack precision and should better address the connection between regime type and WMD acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
