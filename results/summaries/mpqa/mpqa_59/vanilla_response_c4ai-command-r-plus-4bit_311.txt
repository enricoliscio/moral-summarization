SUMMARY: In her recent speech, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice elaborated on President George W. Bush's "axis of evil" remark, which categorized Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as repressive regimes that violate human rights and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. Rice's criteria for inclusion in the "axis of evil" are repressive rule, human rights violations, and actively pursuing nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. However, the definition of repressive rule and human rights violations is vague and subjective, as many countries do not meet the standards of pluralistic democracy. Additionally, the use of the phrase "aggressively seeking" suggests that countries slowly developing such weapons may not be considered part of the axis. The article argues that the development or possession of weapons of mass destruction alone should not be the basis for judging a nation as good or evil, and that the real criterion may be the democratic nature of a regime. The article concludes that Rice could have provided more precise criteria for the "axis of evil" by clearly connecting regime nature with the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.
