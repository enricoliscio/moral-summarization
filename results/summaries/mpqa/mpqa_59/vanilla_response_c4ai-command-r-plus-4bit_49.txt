SUMMARY: In her recent speech, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice elaborated on President George Bush's 'axis of evil,' stating that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are defined as such due to their repressive human rights violations and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. However, the criteria are questionable as there are many other repressive countries, and the pace of acquiring weapons seems to be a determining factor in labeling a country 'evil.' The US's own history with nuclear weapons and the connection between regime type and acquisition of WMDs are also discussed. The article suggests that democratic nations are perceived as more restrained with WMDs, which should be a key criterion for Rice's definition.
END OF SUMMARY.
