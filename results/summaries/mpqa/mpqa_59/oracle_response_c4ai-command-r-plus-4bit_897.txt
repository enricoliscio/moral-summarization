SUMMARY: In a recent address, President George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, Condoleez(z)a Rice, elaborated on the criteria used to define the "axis of evil," which includes Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice stated that these countries are repressive, violate human rights, and are aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, the article argues that there are many other countries that could also be considered repressive and violating human rights. It also questions the use of the phrase "aggressively seeking," suggesting that countries acquiring weapons of mass destruction at a slower pace may not be included in the "axis of evil." The article further argues that the development or possession of such weapons may not be a valid basis for judging a nation as good or evil, especially considering that the US was the first nation to develop and deploy nuclear weapons. Instead, it suggests that the real criterion may be whether a country is democratic or not. Washington seems to be particularly threatened by authoritarian regimes acquiring weapons of mass destruction, irrespective of the pace of their weaponry development. Rice could have provided more precise criteria for the "axis of evil" by establishing a clearer connection between regime nature and weapons acquisition.
