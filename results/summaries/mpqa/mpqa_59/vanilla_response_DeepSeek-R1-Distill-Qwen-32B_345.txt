Alright, I need to summarize this article about Condoleezza Rice's definition of the "axis of evil." Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Rice elaborated on the term, which Bush used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria she set were that these countries are repressive, violate human rights, and seek weapons of mass destruction. 

Hmm, the article then points out that many countries could fit the repressive and human rights violator criteria, not just those three. It questions whether Rice's definition is accurate because every non-pluralistic democracy might be seen as repressive. That's an important point to include.

Next, the article discusses Rice's use of "aggressively seeking" weapons. It suggests that only countries moving quickly to acquire these weapons are considered evil, while others aren't. It also mentions that many countries might want such weapons but are limited by resources or knowledge, not necessarily by wanting to be evil. That's a good point about the context of acquisition.

The article then argues that having weapons of mass destruction alone isn't a reason to label a country evil. It uses the US as an example, which developed and used nuclear weapons. So, the real issue might be whether the country is democratic. If a country is authoritarian and has these weapons, it's seen as a threat. This is a crucial point because it ties the nature of the regime to the threat perception.

I should make sure to highlight that Rice's criteria might be too broad and that the US's own history with nuclear weapons complicates the argument. Also, the article suggests that the real fear is about authoritarian regimes, not just the possession of weapons.

Putting it all together, the summary should mention Rice's criteria, the criticism about the broadness of the definition, the focus on authoritarianism, and the example of the US. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, recently clarified the "axis of evil" term, originally used by Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. She outlined three criteria: these nations are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue that many countries could fit the first two criteria, as any non-pluralistic democracy might be seen as repressive. Rice's mention of "aggressively seeking" weapons implies that only countries pursuing such arms rapidly are labeled as evil, while others, constrained by resources or knowledge, are not. The article questions whether possessing weapons of mass destruction alone justifies labeling a nation as evil, noting that the U.S., which developed and used nuclear weapons, would have been included under this criterion. It suggests that the real issue may be the nature of the regime, with authoritarian states being seen as more threatening when they acquire such weapons. Rice's criteria, therefore, may be too broad and could benefit from clearer definitions linking regime type to the acquisition of weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
