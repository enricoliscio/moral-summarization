SUMMARY: In her recent remarks, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice attempts to clarify the criteria for President George W. Bush's infamous "axis of evil" label, applied to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Rice asserts that these countries are characterized by repressive regimes, egregious human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). However, the article argues that the criteria are flawed and inconsistent. Many other countries could meet these criteria yet are not labeled as part of the "axis of evil." The article suggests that the key factor may be the nature of a country's regime, with democratic nations perceived as less likely to use WMDs. Rice's criteria seem to imply that a country's pace of acquiring WMDs and its democratic status are more important factors than mere possession of such weapons. This raises ethical questions about the fairness and morality of the "axis of evil" label and the potential double standards applied by the US administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
