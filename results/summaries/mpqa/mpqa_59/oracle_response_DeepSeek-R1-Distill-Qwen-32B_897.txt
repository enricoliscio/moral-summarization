Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article discusses Condoleezza Rice's definition of the "axis of evil," which includes Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. She bases this on them being repressive, human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. The author points out that many countries are repressive and violate human rights, so Rice might have erred by not considering all of them. 

The article also mentions that only countries aggressively seeking WMDs are labeled evil, while others are not because they can't afford them. It questions if acquiring WMDs alone makes a country evil, noting the US developed nuclear weapons but isn't labeled evil. The real issue seems to be whether the country is democratic. The author suggests Rice should have clarified the connection between regime type and WMD acquisition.

I need to include the moral words like repressive, violators, seeking, violating, oppressive, erred, basis, reason, evildoer, democratic, threatened, authoritarian, restrained, responsible, elaborated.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key moral terms.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice defined the "axis of evil" as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, citing their repressive nature, human rights violations, and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). However, many other countries also qualify as repressive or human rights violators, suggesting Rice may have erred in her criteria. The focus on "aggressively seeking" WMDs excludes slower-paced developments, while countries without resources or knowledge remain outside the scope. Acquiring WMDs alone may not justify labeling a nation as evil, as the US itself developed nuclear weapons. The real concern appears to be the nature of the regimeâ€”authoritarian versus democratic. Democratic states are seen as more restrained and responsible with WMDs, while authoritarian regimes are viewed as threats. Rice could have elaborated clearer criteria linking regime type to WMD acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
