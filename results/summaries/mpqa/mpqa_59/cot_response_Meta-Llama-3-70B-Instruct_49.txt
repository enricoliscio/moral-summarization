SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, which includes countries that are repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators. The article argues that the mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not a reason to label a state as evil. Instead, the real criterion is whether the nuclear country is democratic, as authoritarian or repressive regimes are seen as more threatening to national security. The article suggests that Rice could have established a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. This raises questions about the morality of labeling countries as "evil" based on their regime type rather than their actions. END OF SUMMARY.
