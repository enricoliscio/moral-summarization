SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, stating that countries must be repressive human rights violators and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition is flawed, as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators, and acquiring weapons of mass destruction is not inherently evil. The US, after all, is the first nation to develop and deploy nuclear weapons. The real concern seems to be that authoritarian or repressive regimes acquiring weapons of mass destruction pose a greater threat to national security. A more precise criterion for the "axis of evil" would be the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. This moral framing suggests that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to weapons of mass destruction, and that the true evil lies in the oppressive nature of the regime, not just the possession of weapons.

END OF SUMMARY.
