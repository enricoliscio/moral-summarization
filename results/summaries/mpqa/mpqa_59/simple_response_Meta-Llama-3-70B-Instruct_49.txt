SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" as countries that are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, this criteria raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and violate human rights, and many are seeking or developing weapons of mass destruction. The author argues that the mere possession of such weapons is not a reason to label a state as evil, citing the US as the first nation to develop and deploy nuclear weapons. Instead, the real criterion should be whether the nuclear country is democratic, as democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction. The author suggests that Rice could have established a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
