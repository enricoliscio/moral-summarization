Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil." Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how Rice set criteria for the term, focusing on repression, human rights violations, and seeking weapons of mass destruction. 

Hmm, the author points out that many countries could fit these criteria, not just Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. They mention that any country without a pluralistic democracy might be seen as violating human rights. That's a good point because it's a broad category. 

The article also discusses the wording "aggressively seeking" weapons. So, only countries actively pursuing WMDs are in the axis, not those moving slowly. But the author argues that possession alone doesn't make a country evil, using the US as an example since they developed nuclear weapons first. 

I should note that the US is the only one to have used such weapons, which adds context. The article suggests that the real issue is whether the country is democratic. Democratic nations are seen as more responsible with WMDs. 

So, the summary needs to capture that Rice's criteria are too broad, the focus on authoritarian regimes, and the argument that possession of WMDs isn't inherently evil. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to highlight these points clearly.

SUMMARY: Condoleezza Rice, former National Security Adviser under President George W. Bush, recently clarified the criteria for the "axis of evil," a term Bush used to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. According to Rice, these countries are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). However, the article argues that many other nations could also fit these criteria, as most countries without pluralistic democracies could be seen as repressive or violating human rights. The term "aggressively seeking" WMDs implies that only countries actively pursuing such weapons qualify, excluding those developing them slowly. The article questions whether possession of WMDs alone should label a nation as evil, noting that the U.S., which developed and used nuclear weapons, is not held to the same standard. It suggests that the real criterion may be whether the regime is democratic, as democratic nations are seen as more responsible with WMDs. Rice's criteria, the article concludes, may be too broad and could have been more precise by linking the nature of the regime to WMD acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
