SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, stating that countries must be repressive human rights violators and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions about its moral validity. There are many countries that violate human rights and seek weapons of mass destruction, but are not considered part of the "axis of evil". The pace of acquiring weapons seems to be a factor, with countries that are slow to develop them being excluded from the label. Moreover, the mere possession of weapons of mass destruction is not a reason to label a state as evil. The real criterion should be whether the country is democratic and responsible in its use of such weapons. The fear is that authoritarian regimes are more likely to use weapons of mass destruction irresponsibly. Rice's definition falls short of establishing a clear connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
