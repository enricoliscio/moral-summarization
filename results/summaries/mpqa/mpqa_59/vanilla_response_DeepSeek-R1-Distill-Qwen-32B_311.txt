Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Condoleezza Rice defining the "axis of evil." The user provided the article, and they want a concise summary of around 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems the article is discussing Rice's criteria for labeling countries as part of the "axis of evil," specifically mentioning Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria are repression, human rights violations, and seeking weapons of mass destruction. 

The article points out that many countries could fit these criteria, not just the three mentioned. It questions whether repression and human rights violations are the sole factors, especially since many countries aren't pluralistic democracies. It also discusses the issue with the term "aggressively seeking" weapons, implying that only those moving quickly are targeted, while others might be developing weapons but not as fast. 

Additionally, the article brings up the point that the US itself has nuclear weapons, so possession alone shouldn't define evil. It suggests that the real issue is whether the regime is democratic. The article concludes that Rice's criteria are too vague and that the connection between regime type and weapons acquisition wasn't clearly explained.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by stating Rice's definition and the three countries. Then, I'll mention the criticism about the broadness of the criteria and how many countries could fit. I'll note the issue with the term "aggressively seeking" and the US's own history with nuclear weapons. Finally, I'll highlight the argument that regime type might be the real issue but wasn't clearly defined.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows well. I'll check for clarity and conciseness, ensuring all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's National Security Adviser, has clarified the criteria for labeling Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of the "axis of evil." She identified these countries as repressive, violating human rights, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue that many other nations could fit these criteria, as repression and human rights violations are common in non-pluralistic democracies. The term "aggressively seeking" weapons implies that only countries pursuing such arsenals rapidly are targeted, excluding others developing weapons at a slower pace. The article questions whether possession of weapons of mass destruction alone justifies labeling a nation as "evil," noting that the U.S. itself developed and used nuclear weapons. It suggests that the real concern lies in whether the regime is democratic, as democratic states are seen as more restrained in using such weapons. Rice's criteria, however, lack precision in linking regime type to weapons acquisition. END OF SUMMARY.
