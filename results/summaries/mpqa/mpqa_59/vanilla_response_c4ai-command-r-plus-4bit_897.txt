SUMMARY: In her recent comments, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice elaborated on President George W. Bush's "axis of evil" reference, stating that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are repressive, violate human rights, and aggressively seek weapons of mass destruction. However, there are many other countries that also repress human rights and seek such weapons. The distinction seems to lie in the pace of their pursuit and the nature of their regimes. Rice's criteria suggest that democratic nations with nuclear capabilities are less of a concern than authoritarian ones, implying that democracy provides restraint and responsibility. This indicates that the real concern is not the weapons themselves but the type of government that possesses them. Washington's focus on specific nations may stem from a belief that democratic regimes are less likely to use weapons of mass destruction. A more precise definition of the "axis of evil" could benefit from a clearer connection between regime type and weapons acquisition.
