SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the "axis of evil" criteria, citing human rights violations and aggressive pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. However, this framing raises moral concerns. Many countries violate human rights and pursue WMDs, yet only Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are singled out. The US, which developed and deployed nuclear weapons, is not considered "evil." The true criterion seems to be whether a country is democratic, as authoritarian regimes are deemed more threatening. This moral double standard is problematic. Rice's definition implies that acquiring WMDs is not inherently evil, but rather the nature of the regime possessing them. A more precise connection between regime type and WMD acquisition is needed to establish a morally sound basis for the "axis of evil."

END OF SUMMARY.
