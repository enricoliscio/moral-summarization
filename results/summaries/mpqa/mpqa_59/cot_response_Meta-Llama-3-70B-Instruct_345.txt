SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has defined the criteria for the "axis of evil" term used by President George Bush to describe Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The criteria include being repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. However, this definition raises questions as many countries can be considered repressive and human rights violators, and several are seeking or developing mass destruction weapons. The article argues that acquiring weapons of mass destruction alone is not a basis for judging a nation as good or evil, and that the real criterion should be whether the nuclear country is democratic. The US seems to be concerned only when authoritarian or repressive nations acquire such weapons, as they are seen as less restrained and responsible. The article suggests that Rice could have established a clearer connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
