SUMMARY:

US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking controversy. This move is seen as hypocritical, as the US claims to lead the fight against terrorism. The article draws parallels with the fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini against Salman Rushdie, which was criticized by Western countries for violating human rights and international law. In contrast, the US has issued an assassination order without proof or documentation, simply based on opposition to the US. The article argues that Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did with Iran, and that the US is trying to justify its inhumane behavior through military might.
