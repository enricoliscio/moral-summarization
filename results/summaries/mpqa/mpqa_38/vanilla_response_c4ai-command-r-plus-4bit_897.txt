SUMMARY: US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, a directive that contradicts the country's purported leadership in the fight against terrorism. This move has sparked comparisons to the fatwa issued by the Imam against Salman Rushdie, which Western countries criticized as a violation of human rights and freedom of expression. In response, European countries recalled their ambassadors from Tehran, pressuring Iran. However, the US assassination order lacks any proof or justification, targeting individuals solely for opposing the US. The article calls for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for Western nations to hold the US accountable for violating the human rights of countless individuals. It criticizes the US for reverting to pre-historic justice and attempting to drown out global cries for justice with the explosions of bombs.
END OF SUMMARY.
