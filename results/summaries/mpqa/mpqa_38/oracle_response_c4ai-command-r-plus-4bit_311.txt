SUMMARY: In a shocking move, US President Bush has directed the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This directive is a blatant violation of human rights, as it targets millions of people without proof or reason. The US justifies its cruel behavior with the might of its bombs, while Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors, as Europe did when Iran issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet. The world must not allow the hard-won concept of God-given human rights to be wasted and must stand against the US's unjust and inhumane actions. END OF SUMMARY.
