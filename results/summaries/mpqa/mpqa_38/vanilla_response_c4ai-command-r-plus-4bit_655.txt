SUMMARY: In a controversial move, US President Bush has authorized the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, raising concerns about the country's commitment to fighting terrorism and respecting human rights. This directive contrasts with the reaction to the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie, where Western countries criticized it as an act of terrorism and a violation of human rights. The article argues that the US assassination order lacks justification and proof, targeting anyone who opposes the country. It calls for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US, highlighting the double standards in the West's response to human rights violations. The article also criticizes the US for regressing to pre-historic notions of justice and using explosive force to silence the cries for justice worldwide.

END OF SUMMARY.
