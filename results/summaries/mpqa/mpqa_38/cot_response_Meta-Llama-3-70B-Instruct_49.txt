SUMMARY:
The US President has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of terrorism. This move is seen as a blatant violation of human rights and international law, with the US claiming to lead the fight against terrorism. The author draws a parallel with the Imam's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was also deemed an act of terrorism by Western countries. The US's assassination order is seen as a cruel and inhuman act, with no proof, reason, or documentation. The author calls on Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for European countries to recall their ambassadors, citing the US's blatant disregard for human rights. The US's actions are seen as a threat to the hard-won discovery of God-given human rights, and a return to pre-historic times. END OF SUMMARY.
