Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article starts by stating that US President Bush ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally. The author is critical of this, especially since the US is leading the fight against terrorism. They compare this to the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by the Imam, which was protested by human rights supporters, leading to ambassadors being recalled from Iran. The author points out that Iran clarified the fatwa, showing it was about defending the Prophet's honor, supported by all Islamic clerics. Now, the US is issuing an assassination order without proof or reason, targeting millions. The author suggests Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors from the US, just as Europe did from Iran. They argue the US is violating human rights on a larger scale and is resorting to pre-historic justice after 9/11. The US is using force to silence global justice cries, which the author sees as cruel and unacceptable.

The moral words used include assassinate, directive, satisfied, insulting, peace, protested, move, recalled, pressure, violating, order, proof, reason, documentation, withdraw, recall, determined, take, put, cruelty, allow, wasted, silence, justiceseeking, explosions, justify, behavior.

I need to summarize this, keeping those words. The summary should highlight the US's assassination directive, the hypocrisy compared to Iran's fatwa, the lack of proof, the call for ambassadors' withdrawal, and the criticism of US behavior as cruel and against human rights.

Let me structure this:

- Start with Bush's directive to assassinate opponents.
- Mention the US's role in fighting terrorism.
- Compare to Iran's fatwa, which was protested by Europe.
- Highlight that Iran clarified the fatwa as defending Prophet's honor.
- Now, US is issuing an order without proof, targeting millions.
- Suggest Islamic countries withdraw ambassadors, as Europe did.
- Criticize US for violating human rights on a larger scale.
- Mention the US's determination to use pre-historic justice after 9/11.
- Conclude that the world won't allow human rights to be wasted, and the US is using force to silence justice.

I need to make sure to include as many moral words as possible without making it too long. Let me try to craft a concise summary using these points and the specified words.

The author condemns the US for violating human rights on a larger scale and using pre-historic justice post-9/11.
