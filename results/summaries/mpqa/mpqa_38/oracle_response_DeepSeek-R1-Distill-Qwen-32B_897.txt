Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is comparing the actions of the US government under Bush with Iran's response to Salman Rushdie. It's using strong moral terms like "assassinate" and "violating human rights." The author is clearly critical of the US for ordering assassinations without proof, contrasting it with Iran's fatwa which was also protested but on different grounds.

I need to make sure I include the key morally framed words: assassinate, directive, satisfied, insulting, peace, protested, move, recalled, pressure, violating, order, proof, reason, documentation, withdraw, recall, determined, take, put, cruelty, allow, wasted, silence, justiceseeking, explosions, justify, behavior.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I should start by highlighting Bush's directive to assassinate opponents. Then contrast it with Iran's fatwa and the international reaction. Emphasize the hypocrisy of the US claiming to fight terrorism while ordering assassinations without justification. Mention the call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors and the double standards of European countries. Conclude with the moral implications and the threat to human rights principles.

I need to make sure the summary flows well, using the specified moral terms without making it sound too disjointed. I'll structure it to first present the US action, then the comparison with Iran, followed by the call to action for Islamic countries and the critique of European hypocrisy, ending with the broader moral stance against US cruelty.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll present the summary as per the user's instructions, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY:  
US President Bush has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, a move that contrasts sharply with the moral outrage expressed by Western countries over Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the holy Koran. While European nations withdrew ambassadors from Iran, accusing it of violating human rights, the US now targets millions without proof, reason, or documentation, solely for opposing its interests. The author highlights the hypocrisy of Western criticism, urging Islamic countries to reciprocate by withdrawing ambassadors from the US. The article condemns the US for its cruelty and inhuman behavior, questioning its commitment to justice and human rights. It emphasizes the global rejection of such actions and the need to protect human rights principles, asserting that no nation should tolerate such violations. The US's reliance on force to silence global justice-seeking cries is criticized as a regression to pre-historic justice, with the author calling for accountability and moral integrity in international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
