Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by mentioning President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents worldwide. That's a strong statement. The article contrasts this with the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by the Imam, where the US and Europe protested, calling it terrorism and against human rights. They even recalled ambassadors from Iran. 

The article points out that Iran clarified the fatwa, explaining it was about protecting the Prophet's honor, which is a collective right for millions. Now, the US is assassinating without proof, just because of opposition. The writer suggests Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors from the US, just like Europe did with Iran. The US is accused of violating many people's rights, not just one. 

The article also mentions that after 9/11, the US is resorting to "pre-historic" justice, using bombs to silence global cries for justice. The writer believes this is unacceptable and that human rights shouldn't be ignored.

So, to summarize, the key points are: Bush's CIA assassination order, contrast with Rushdie fatwa protests, hypocrisy in US and Europe's response, Iran's clarification, the US's broad violation of rights, and the call for diplomatic action against the US. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: US President Bush has authorized the CIA to assassinate opponents globally, a move criticized as hypocrisy given past protests against Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. The article highlights the double standard, where Iran faced backlash for defending religious honor, while the US now targets millions without evidence. It calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, mirroring Europe's move against Iran, and criticizes the US for violating human rights on a large scale. The piece condemns the US's post-9/11 approach as disregarding justice and human rights, urging global opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
