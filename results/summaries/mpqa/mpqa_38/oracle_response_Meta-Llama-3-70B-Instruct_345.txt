SUMMARY:

US President Bush has issued a directive to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and hypocrisy. This move is particularly galling given the international outcry over Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the holy Koran. The European countries, claiming to support human rights, protested and recalled their ambassadors from Tehran, citing terrorism and human rights violations. Now, the US is violating human rights on a massive scale, issuing an assassination order without proof, reason, or documentation, simply because of opposition to the US. It is morally incumbent upon Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for European countries to recall theirs, just as they did with Iran. The US is determined to take justice back to pre-historic times, using 7-ton bombs to silence the justice-seeking cries of the people. This cruelty will not be allowed to waste away the hard-won human rights achieved over thousands of years.

END OF SUMMARY.
