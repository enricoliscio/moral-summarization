SUMMARY: US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking controversy as the country leads the global fight against terrorism. This directive is compared to a previous incident where the Islamic Republic of Iran issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran. Western countries protested, claiming it violated human rights and international law. However, the article argues that the US assassination order lacks proof, reason, or documentation and is based solely on opposition to the country. It calls for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for Western countries to apply the same standards they used to judge Iran. The article concludes by criticizing the US for attempting to silence global justice with military force and justifying inhumane behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
