Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is comparing the US's actions to Iran's in terms of human rights. Let me read through the text again to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that President Bush ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide. This is presented as a moral issue because the US is supposedly leading the fight against terrorism. Then it contrasts this with Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was criticized by Western countries for violating human rights. The article argues that Iran's action was a religious decree supported by clerics, whereas the US's assassination order is without proof or reason, targeting millions just for opposing the US.

The author is critical of the US's hypocrisy, pointing out that while Europe condemned Iran, they didn't do the same for the US's actions. The moral argument here is that the US is violating human rights on a larger scale, which should be met with similar diplomatic actions, like recalling ambassadors.

I need to make sure the summary captures this contrast and the moral critique. I should mention the US's assassination directive, compare it to Iran's fatwa, note the hypocrisy in Western responses, and highlight the call for Islamic countries to take action against the US.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the original's tone and moral stance. Let me structure it by first stating the US directive, then contrasting with Iran's case, discussing the hypocrisy, and concluding with the call to action.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral hypocrisy of the U.S. government by comparing its directive to assassinate opponents globally with Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. While the U.S. claims to fight terrorism, it issues assassination orders without proof or justification, targeting millions for opposing it. In contrast, Iran's fatwa was widely condemned as a human rights violation, leading European countries to recall ambassadors. The article argues that the U.S. is committing a greater injustice, affecting many more people, and calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the U.S., just as Europe did from Iran. It criticizes the U.S. for using force to silence global justice cries, suggesting it is reverting to prehistoric justice and urging the world to protect human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
