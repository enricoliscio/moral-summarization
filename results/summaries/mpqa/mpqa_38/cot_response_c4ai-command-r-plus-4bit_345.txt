SUMMARY: The US President has directed the CIA to assassinate America's *opponents* worldwide, despite the country's claims of leading the fight against *terrorism*. When a fatwa was issued against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran, *human rights supporters* protested, calling it an *act of terrorism* that *crushed human rights principles*. In response, European countries recalled their ambassadors from Tehran. The Islamic Republic of Iran clarified that the insult violated the *rights* of millions of Muslims worldwide and was supported by *clerics*. Now, the US has issued an *assassination order* without proof, targeting those who oppose them. This double standard is evident as the US violates the *rights* of many, yet faces no consequences. Islamic countries should recall their ambassadors from the US as a stand against this *inhuman behavior*. The US, with its 7-ton bombs, aims to silence the *justice-seeking cries* of the world.
END OF SUMMARY.
