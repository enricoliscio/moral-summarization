SUMMARY: US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, a directive that contradicts the country's purported leadership in the fight against global terrorism. This move has sparked comparisons to the fatwa issued by the Imam against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran, which Western countries criticized as a violation of human rights and international law. The article argues that the US assassination order lacks proof, reason, or documentation and is based solely on opposition to the country. It calls for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US, mirroring the earlier action by European countries in response to the Rushdie fatwa. The article condemns the US for attempting to silence global cries for justice with military force and justifying inhumane behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
