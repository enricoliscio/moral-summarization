SUMMARY:

US President Bush has issued a directive to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of violating human rights principles. This move is particularly hypocritical, considering the international outcry against Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the holy Koran. The European countries had recalled their ambassadors from Tehran, citing terrorism and human rights violations. Now, the US is ordering the assassination of millions without proof, reason, or documentation, simply due to opposition to the US. It is only fitting that Islamic countries withdraw their ambassadors from the US, just as the European countries did with Iran. The US is determined to take justice back to pre-historic times, using 7-ton bombs to silence the justice-seeking cries of the world's people and justify its own inhumane behavior. This cruelty will not be allowed to waste away the hard-won human achievement of God-given human rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
