Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that President Bush ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide. The author is critical of this, pointing out the hypocrisy since the U.S. claims to lead the fight against terrorism. There's a comparison made with Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, where the West protested, calling it terrorism and a violation of human rights, leading to ambassadors being recalled. The author argues that Iran's action was justified because it defended the Prophet and millions of Muslims, whereas the U.S. is now targeting millions without proof, just because of opposition.

The author suggests that Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the U.S., just as Europe did from Iran, if they're consistent in their stance on human rights. The U.S. is accused of reverting to pre-historic justice after 9/11, using bombs to silence global cries for justice, which is seen as inhuman and unacceptable.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main points: Bush's directive, the hypocrisy in the U.S. stance, the comparison with Iran's fatwa, the call for ambassadors' withdrawal, and the criticism of U.S. justice and actions post-9/11. I need to maintain the moral tone, highlighting the contrast between U.S. actions and its claims, as well as the hypocrisy in international reactions.

I'll structure it by first mentioning Bush's order, then the hypocrisy, the fatwa comparison, the call for ambassadors' withdrawal, and the critique of U.S. justice and actions. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: US President Bush has authorized the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, a move criticized as hypocritical given the US's claim to lead the fight against terrorism. The article draws a moral comparison to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which the West condemned as terrorism, despite Iran defending its religious and human rights. The author argues that the US is now targeting millions without proof, simply for opposing it, and calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, as Europe did from Iran. The US is accused of prioritizing power over human rights and using violence to silence global justice cries, reverting to pre-historic justice after 9/11. The author emphasizes the moral duty to protect human rights and opposes the US's inhumane actions. END OF SUMMARY.
