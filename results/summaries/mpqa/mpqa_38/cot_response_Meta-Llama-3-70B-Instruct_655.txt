SUMMARY:
The US President has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of hypocrisy. This move is seen as a blatant violation of human rights, particularly in light of the international community's condemnation of Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet. The author argues that the US is attempting to justify its own inhuman behavior by silencing justice-seeking voices with military might. The directive is seen as a cruel and terrorism-like act, with no proof, reason, or documentation to support it. The author calls on Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for European countries to recall their ambassadors in protest of this violation of human rights. The US is accused of attempting to take justice back to pre-historic times, and the author asserts that no country will tolerate this cruelty. END OF SUMMARY.
