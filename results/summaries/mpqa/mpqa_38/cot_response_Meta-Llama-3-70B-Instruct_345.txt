SUMMARY:
The US President has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of terrorism. This move is seen as a blatant violation of human rights, reminiscent of the Imam's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the holy Koran. The international community had condemned the fatwa as an act of terrorism, yet the US is now engaging in a similar act of cruelty, targeting millions of people without proof or reason. The Islamic world is calling for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US, citing the violation of human rights on a massive scale. The US is trying to silence the justice-seeking cries of the people with the sound of explosions, but this inhuman behavior will not be tolerated. END OF SUMMARY.
