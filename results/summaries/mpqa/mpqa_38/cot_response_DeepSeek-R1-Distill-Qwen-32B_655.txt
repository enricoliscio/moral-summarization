Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents, which is framed as a moral issue. The article compares this to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, highlighting the hypocrisy of Western countries in condemning Iran but not the US for similar actions.

The user has specified two steps. Step 1 is to identify all single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "assassinate," "terrorism," "oppress," "protest," "human rights," "crush," "pressure," "violation," "cruelty," "inhuman," and "silence" stand out as they carry strong moral implications.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should highlight the moral comparison between the US and Iran, the hypocrisy of Western countries, and the call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the US action, then the comparison to Iran's fatwa, the hypocrisy of Western responses, and the call to action for Islamic countries. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, emphasizing the unfairness and double standards.

I also need to remember to structure the response with "STEP 1:" followed by each moral word on a new line, and then the "SUMMARY:" section with the concise summary ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise, making sure the moral points are clearly articulated. Let me make sure I don't exceed 200 words and that all key points from the article are included.

**STEP 1:**  
* Assassinate  
* Terrorism  
* Opponents  
* Protest  
* Human rights  
* Crush  
* Pressure  
* Violating  
* Cruelty  
* Inhuman  
* Silence  

**SUMMARY:**  
US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, raising moral concerns about the use of violence to silence dissent. This directive contrasts sharply with the global outcry when Iran issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet, which was condemned as terrorism and a violation of human rights. European countries withdrew ambassadors from Iran to protest, but now the US is accused of targeting millions without proof or justification, merely for opposing American interests. The article highlights the hypocrisy of Western nations, which condemned Iran for violating human rights but remain silent on the US's actions. It calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, arguing that the US is committing a far greater injustice by violating the rights of many. The text criticizes the US for resorting to prehistoric justice and inhuman behavior, urging the world to stand against such cruelty and uphold human rights.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
