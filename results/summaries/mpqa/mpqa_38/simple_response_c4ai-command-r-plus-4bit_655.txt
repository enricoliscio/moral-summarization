SUMMARY: In a shocking development, US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This hypocritical move contrasts with the outrage expressed by supposed supporters of human rights when the Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran. The fatwa was clarified as a defense of the rights of millions of people, yet the US now issues an assassination order without proof or reason. Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did with Iran. The US is attempting to silence the cries for justice with violent explosions and inhumane behavior. This cruelty will not be tolerated, and the hard-won human rights achievements will not be squandered.
END OF SUMMARY.
