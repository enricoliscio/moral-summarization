SUMMARY:

The US President has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of terrorism. This move is hypocritical, given the international outcry against Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet. The Imam's edict was deemed a violation of human rights, yet the US is now ordering the killing of millions without proof, reason, or documentation. The only criterion is opposition to the US. In response, Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did with Iran. The US is determined to take justice back to pre-historic times, violating human rights and ignoring the justice-seeking cries of the world's people. Its inhuman behavior is unacceptable and will not be silenced by the sound of explosions. The world will not allow this cruelty to go unchecked.

END OF SUMMARY.
