SUMMARY:

The US President has issued a directive to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of violating human rights principles. This move is seen as hypocritical, given the international outcry against Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet. The Imam's edict was deemed an act of terrorism, while the US order is seen as a blatant disregard for human life. The author argues that the US has no proof, reason, or documentation to justify this order, and that it is simply a means to silence opposition. The international community should recall their ambassadors from the US, just as they did with Iran, to protest this cruel and inhumane behavior. The US is determined to take justice back to pre-historic times, but the world will not allow this erosion of human rights, achieved after thousands of years of research. The US must be held accountable for its actions, and its attempts to justify its inhuman behavior will not be tolerated.

END OF SUMMARY.
