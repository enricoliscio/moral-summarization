Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by talking about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally. It contrasts this with the US claiming to lead the fight against terrorism. Then it mentions the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by the Imam, which Iran defended, leading to European countries recalling their ambassadors. The article points out that while Iran was criticized for that fatwa, the US is now ordering assassinations without proof, targeting millions just for opposing them. It suggests Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors from the US, just as Europe did with Iran, because the US is violating more human rights. The article criticizes the US for reverting to pre-historic justice after 9/11 and for using military force to silence global justice cries.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Bush's CIA directive, the contrast with the US's anti-terrorism stance, the Rushdie fatwa and Europe's reaction, the hypocrisy in the US's actions, the call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors, and the criticism of the US's approach to justice post-9/11.

Let me structure this. Start with Bush's order, mention the contrast with fighting terrorism. Then discuss the Rushdie fatwa and Europe's response. Highlight the hypocrisy in the US's current actions versus their past stance. Note the call for ambassadors' withdrawal. Conclude with the criticism of the US's justice approach and its use of military force.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too detailed. Also, keep it concise, within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence adds a new point without overlapping.

The piece advocates for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, akin to Europe's action against Iran, due to the US's alleged human rights violations.
