SUMMARY:

The US President has ordered the CIA to assassinate opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and hypocrisy accusations. The author recalls the international backlash against Iran when Imam Khomeini issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet, with European countries recalling their ambassadors from Tehran. In contrast, the US has issued a blanket assassination order without proof or reason, solely based on opposition to the US. The author argues that Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the US and that European countries should recall theirs, citing the US's violation of human rights on a massive scale. The US's actions are seen as a desperate attempt to silence justice-seeking voices and justify its own inhuman behavior through military might. The author condemns the US's regression to "pre-historic times" and its disregard for human rights achieved after thousands of years of research.
