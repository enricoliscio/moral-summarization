SUMMARY: In a shocking development, US President Bush has directed the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the global fight against terrorism. This hypocritical move echoes the double standards applied when the Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie, as Western nations decried it as terrorism and a violation of human rights. However, when the US now issues an assassination order against millions without evidence, the same nations remain silent. The Islamic Republic of Iran rightfully clarified that insulting the Prophet violated the rights of millions of believers, yet the US continues to trample on human rights with impunity. The US seems intent on reverting to pre-historic justice, ignoring the hard-won progress in recognizing God-given human rights. The cruelty and injustice of the US must not be allowed to drown out the cries for justice from the rest of the world. END OF SUMMARY.
