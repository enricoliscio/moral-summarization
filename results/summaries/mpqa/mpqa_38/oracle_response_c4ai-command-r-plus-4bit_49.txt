SUMMARY: US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, a directive that contradicts the country's claimed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This order, issued without proof or reason, violates human rights and international law, echoing a past incident where Western nations protested a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting Islam. The double standard is evident as the US justifies its cruel and inhumane behavior with explosions and noise, while Islamic countries, in a justified move, should recall their ambassadors from the US to protect the rights of their people. The world will not allow the achievements of thousands of years of human rights research to be wasted by such unjustified and oppressive actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
