Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article talks about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents globally. It contrasts this with the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, where the US and Europe reacted strongly, calling it terrorism and human rights violations. Iran defended their stance, explaining it was about protecting the Prophet's honor. Now, the US is doing something similar but on a larger scale without any proof. The article suggests that Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors from the US, just as Europe did from Iran, if they're serious about human rights. It also criticizes the US for using military force after 9/11, implying they're ignoring human rights principles. The tone is critical of the US, comparing their actions unfavorably to their past reactions to similar situations.

So, I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Bush's directive to the CIA, then the comparison to the Rushdie fatwa and Europe's reaction. Then, note Iran's clarification and the argument for Islamic countries to respond similarly. Highlight the criticism of the US's actions post-9/11 and their seeming disregard for human rights. Make sure to include the main points without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: US President Bush has directed the CIA to assassinate opponents globally, sparking criticism amid claims of leading the fight against terrorism. The article contrasts this with the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie, where the West condemned Iran for human rights violations, recalling ambassadors in protest. Iran argued the fatwa protected the Prophet's honor, a stance supported by many Muslims. Now, the US is accused of targeting millions without proof, simply for opposing it. The article suggests Islamic countries withdraw ambassadors from the US, as Europe did from Iran, if they truly uphold human rights. It criticizes the US for justifying inhuman actions post-9/11, using military force to silence global justice cries. The piece highlights hypocrisy in the US stance on terrorism and human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
