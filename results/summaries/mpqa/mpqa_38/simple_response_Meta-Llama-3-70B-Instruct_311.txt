SUMMARY:

The article condemns the US President's order to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, citing it as a blatant violation of human rights and international law. The author draws a parallel with the Imam's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was criticized by Western countries as an act of terrorism. In contrast, the US directive is seen as a cruel and unjustified attack on millions of people, simply because they oppose the US. The article argues that if European countries were genuinely concerned about human rights, they should recall their ambassadors from the US, just as they did with Iran. The author concludes that the US is attempting to undermine the progress made in human rights and justice, and that no country will tolerate such cruelty.
