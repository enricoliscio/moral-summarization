SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the US government for ordering the CIA to assassinate its opponents worldwide, claiming it is a violation of human rights and international law. The author draws a comparison to the fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini against Salman Rushdie, which was also condemned by Western countries as an act of terrorism. The article argues that the US directive is a more severe violation of human rights, as it targets millions of people without proof or documentation, solely based on opposition to the US. The author suggests that Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the US and that European countries should recall their ambassadors from the US if they were honest in their condemnation of Iran. The article concludes that no country will tolerate such cruelty and that the US cannot silence justice-seeking voices with violence.
