SUMMARY: In a shocking development, US President Bush has instructed the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This order is reminiscent of the fatwa issued by the Imam against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Holy Koran, which sparked protests from self-proclaimed supporters of human rights. The fatwa was deemed an act of terrorism and a violation of international law and human rights principles. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran clarified that insulting the Prophet violated the rights of millions of Muslims worldwide, emphasizing that it was a directive from God, confirmed by Islamic clerics. Now, the US has issued an assassination order without proof or reason, targeting those who oppose them. This hypocrisy calls for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries recalled their ambassadors from Iran, claiming to uphold human rights. The US's actions threaten to set justice back to pre-historic times, disregarding the hard-won human achievement of recognizing and protecting God-given human rights. The use of explosive force and noise to drown out the cries for justice from people worldwide underscores the inhumanity of the US's behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
