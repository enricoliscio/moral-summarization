Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided an example summary, so I should make sure my approach aligns with that.

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's comparing the US's CIA assassination order to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. The author is criticizing the US for hypocrisy, pointing out that while Iran faced backlash for the fatwa, the US is now doing something similar but on a larger scale without justification.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral contrast. The article mentions that Iran's action was widely condemned as violating human rights, but the US's directive is even more severe, targeting millions without proof. The author suggests that if countries withdrew ambassadors from Iran for human rights issues, they should do the same with the US now.

I should also include the part about the US's actions being seen as a regression to pre-historic justice, especially after 9/11, and how it's not acceptable to undermine human rights advancements.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well. Maybe start by stating the directive, then compare it to Iran's fatwa, mention the hypocrisy, and conclude with the call for diplomatic action and the importance of human rights.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduce Bush's directive to CIA to assassinate opponents globally.
2. Contrast with Iran's fatwa against Rushdie, which was condemned.
3. Highlight the hypocrisy of the US's actions while fighting terrorism.
4. Mention the lack of proof or reason in the US's directive.
5. Suggest that Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors from the US, similar to how Europe did with Iran.
6. Critique the US's approach as regressive and harmful to human rights.
7. Conclude with the global rejection of such cruelty and the need to uphold human rights.

I need to make sure each point is clear and the moral judgment is preserved. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text. Let me try to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: US President Bush has authorized the CIA to assassinate opponents worldwide, a move criticized for its hypocrisy, especially as the US leads the fight against terrorism. This directive is contrasted with Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which faced global condemnation for violating human rights. The article highlights that while Iran was pressured for targeting one individual, the US now threatens millions without justification. It calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, mirroring Europe's move against Iran, to protest this severe human rights violation. The US's action is seen as regressive, undermining global human rights progress, and is expected to face global rejection. END OF SUMMARY.
