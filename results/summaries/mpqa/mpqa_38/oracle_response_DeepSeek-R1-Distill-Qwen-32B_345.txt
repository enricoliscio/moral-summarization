Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents, which is framed as a moral issue. The author compares this to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, where the US and Europe protested, but now the US is doing something worse.

I need to highlight the contrast between the US's hypocrisy. They criticized Iran for a fatwa but now are assassinating without proof. The author uses words like "assassinate," "directive," "protested," "pressure," "violating," "order," etc.

I should structure the summary to show the US's actions as morally wrong, using the provided words. I'll mention the fatwa as a point of comparison, then move to the US's assassination order, noting the lack of proof and reason. Then, I'll address the hypocrisy of the US and Europe, suggesting Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors, just as Europe did with Iran.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key morally framed terms without making it too wordy. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and maintains the moral critique.

SUMMARY:  
US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, a directive issued amid claims of leading the fight against terrorism. The author draws a moral comparison to the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which Iran issued for insulting the Prophet and the Quran. At the time, Western countries, claiming to uphold human rights, protested, recalling ambassadors from Tehran to pressure Iran. However, the US now targets millions without proof, reason, or documentation, solely for opposing it. The author condemns this as a violation of human rights on a massive scale, urging Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, just as Europe did with Iran. The US, the author argues, is resorting to pre-historic justice, using cruelty and explosions to silence global justice-seeking cries. This behavior, the author warns, cannot be allowed, as it threatens the progress made in recognizing God-given human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
