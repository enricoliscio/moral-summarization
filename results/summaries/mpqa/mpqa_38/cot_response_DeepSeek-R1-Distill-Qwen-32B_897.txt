Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll read the article to understand its content. It's about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents, contrasting it with Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. The article criticizes the US for hypocrisy, pointing out that while they condemned Iran for human rights violations, they themselves are now doing something similar on a larger scale.

The user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "assassinate," "opponents," "terrorism," "protest," "crushed," "pressure," "violating," "cruelty," "inhuman," and "hypocrisy" stand out as they express moral judgment.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words. I'll structure it by first mentioning Bush's directive, then contrasting it with Iran's fatwa and the international reaction. I'll highlight the hypocrisy and call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors, ending with a statement about the US's inhuman actions.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically and retains the original's critical tone. Also, I need to start the summary with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

Finally, I'll review everything to make sure I followed all instructions correctly and that the summary accurately reflects the moral framing of the original article.

* Assassinate

* Cruelty  
* Inhuman  
* Hypocrisy  

**SUMMARY:**  
US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, raising moral concerns. This directive contrasts sharply with the international outcry against Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was condemned as terrorism and a violation of human rights. The article highlights the hypocrisy of Western countries, which criticized Iran for targeting one individual but remain silent as the US targets millions without justification. The Islamic Republic of Iran argued that insulting the Prophet Muhammad violated the rights of millions, a stance supported by the global Islamic community. The article calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, just as Europe did from Iran, to protest the US's actions. It criticizes the US for disregarding human rights and resorting to inhuman behavior, urging the world to reject such cruelty and uphold the principles of justice and human dignity.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
