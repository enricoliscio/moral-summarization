SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the US government's directive to assassinate its opponents worldwide, citing it as a violation of human rights. The author draws a parallel with the fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini against Salman Rushdie, which was condemned by Western countries as an act of terrorism. The article argues that the US directive is a more severe violation of human rights, as it targets millions of people without proof or reason. It calls on Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for European countries to recall their ambassadors from the US, just as they did with Iran. The article concludes that the US is trying to take justice back to pre-historic times and that no country will tolerate this cruelty, which undermines the hard-won achievement of human rights.
