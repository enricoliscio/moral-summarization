SUMMARY: In a shocking development, US President Bush has directed the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's purported leadership in the global fight against terrorism. This hypocritical move mirrors the outrage expressed by self-proclaimed human rights defenders when the Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran. The fatwa was justified as a defense of the rights of millions of Muslims, yet the US now issues a blanket assassination order without evidence or justification. Double standards are evident as the US attempts to revert to pre-historic justice, disregarding the hard-won concept of human rights. The US believes it can drown out the calls for justice with explosions and justify its inhumane actions through brute force. Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors from the US, mirroring the earlier reaction of European countries to Iran. The world must not tolerate this cruelty and the erosion of human rights. 

END OF SUMMARY.
