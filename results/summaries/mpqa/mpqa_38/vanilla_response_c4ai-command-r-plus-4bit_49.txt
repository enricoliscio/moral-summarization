SUMMARY: US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, raising concerns about the country's commitment to fighting terrorism and respecting human rights. This directive stands in contrast to the protests against the fatwa issued by the Imam against Salman Rushdie, which Western countries claimed violated human rights and international law. The Islamic Republic of Iran defended the fatwa, arguing that insulting the Prophet violated the rights of millions of Muslims worldwide. Now, the US has issued an assassination order without proof or reason, targeting those who oppose the country. The article calls for a similar response from Islamic countries and challenges the double standards of Western nations, urging them to recall their ambassadors from the US if they are truly committed to human rights. It criticizes the US for its aggressive and unjust approach, suggesting that it seeks to silence global calls for justice with military force and explosions. END OF SUMMARY.
