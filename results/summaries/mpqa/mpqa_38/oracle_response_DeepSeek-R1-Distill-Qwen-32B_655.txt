Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents, which is a strong moral statement. The author compares this to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, highlighting the hypocrisy of Western countries in their reactions.

I should identify the key morally charged words the author used, like "assassinate," "directive," "insulting," and "cruelty." These words set a strong tone, so I need to include them in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and maintain that moral perspective.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Bush's assassination order, the comparison to Iran's fatwa, the hypocrisy of Western countries, and the call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors. I'll make sure to use the specified moral terms to frame the summary accurately.

I also need to ensure the summary flows logically, connecting the actions of the US with the reactions of other countries, emphasizing the moral inconsistency. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure all important points are covered without being too verbose.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the author's moral stance, using the specified words and maintaining a clear, concise structure. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY:  
US President Bush has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, a move that raises moral concerns, especially as the US claims to lead the fight against terrorism. The article draws a parallel to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet Muhammad, which was widely condemned by Western countries as a violation of human rights. The author highlights the hypocrisy of these nations, as they now remain silent while the US targets millions without proof or justification. The article criticizes the US for its cruelty and inhuman behavior, urging Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, just as Western countries did from Iran. The author argues that the US is undermining human rights and wasting away the progress made in recognizing God-given human rights. The article concludes by condemning the US for using violence to silence justice-seeking cries, questioning its justification for such behavior in the aftermath of September 11. END OF SUMMARY.
