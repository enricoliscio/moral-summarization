SUMMARY: In a shocking move, US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This hypocritical action stands in stark contrast to the reaction of Western nations to the fatwa issued by the Imam against Salman Rushdie, which was justified as defending the rights of millions of Muslims against insults to the Prophet and the Koran. The double standards are clear: while Iran was pressured for allegedly violating human rights, the US faces no consequences for its indiscriminate targeting of human beings based solely on their opposition to America. Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors from the US, and Western nations should demonstrate their commitment to human rights by recalling their ambassadors as well. The US must not be allowed to regress justice to pre-historic times, trampling on the hard-won concept of God-given human rights with its violent and unjustifiable actions. END OF SUMMARY.
