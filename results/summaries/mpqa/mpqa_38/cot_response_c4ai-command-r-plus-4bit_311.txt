SUMMARY:
The US President has instructed the CIA to assassinate America's *opponents* worldwide, raising questions about the country's commitment to fighting *terrorism*. When Iran's Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran, self-proclaimed *supporters* of *human rights* protested, calling it an *act of terrorism* and a violation of *international law* and *human rights principles*. In contrast, the US has issued an *assassination order* without proof, targeting those who oppose it. This double standard is highlighted, suggesting that Islamic countries should recall their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did with Iran over *human rights* concerns. The author condemns the US for its *cruelty* and its attempt to silence the *justice*-seeking voices of the world with explosions and *inhuman behavior*. The US is criticized for disregarding the *achievement* of discovering and upholding *God-given human rights*, which are the result of millennia of *research* and must not be *wasted*.
