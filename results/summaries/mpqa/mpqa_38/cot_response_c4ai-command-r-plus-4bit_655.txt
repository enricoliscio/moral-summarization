SUMMARY:
The US President has instructed the CIA to assassinate America's *opponents* worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the fight against *terrorism*. When a fatwa was issued against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran, Western nations *protesting*, claiming it violated *rights*. Now, the US has issued an assassination order without proof, simply for opposing America. Islamic nations should recall their ambassadors, as the West did with Iran, to stand against this *violation* of *rights*. The US seems determined to revert to *justice* of the past, ignoring the *achievement* of God-given *rights* and the cries of the world for *justice*. Its attempts to justify its *inhuman* actions with explosions and noise must not succeed. 

END OF SUMMARY.
