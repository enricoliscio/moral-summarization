Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral stance.

The article starts by stating that President Bush ordered the CIA to assassinate opponents globally. The author is clearly critical of this action, especially since the U.S. claims to be leading the fight against terrorism. There's a comparison made with Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. The author points out that when Iran issued that fatwa, Western countries condemned it as terrorism and withdrew ambassadors. Now, the U.S. is doing something similar but on a larger scale, targeting millions without proof.

The moral argument here is about hypocrisy. The author is pointing out that the U.S. is criticizing Iran for human rights violations but is now engaging in a much larger violation themselves. The author suggests that Islamic countries should withdraw ambassadors from the U.S., just as Europe did from Iran, to hold the U.S. accountable.

I need to capture this moral critique in the summary. The key points are:
1. Bush's directive to assassinate opponents.
2. Contrast with the U.S. leading the fight against terrorism.
3. Comparison to Iran's fatwa and the international reaction.
4. Hypocrisy in the U.S. condemning Iran while doing worse.
5. Call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors.
6. Criticism of the U.S. reverting to "pre-historic justice" and using force to silence critics.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these points while highlighting the moral inconsistency. I'll structure it to first mention Bush's order, then the comparison to Iran, the hypocrisy, the call for diplomatic action, and the criticism of U.S. methods.

Let me draft this, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll start with the main action, then the comparison, the moral argument, the call to action, and the critique of the U.S. approach. That should cover all necessary elements while preserving the author's moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
US President Bush has authorized the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, a move criticized as hypocritical given the US's role in leading the global fight against terrorism. The article draws a parallel to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was widely condemned by Western countries as a violation of human rights. European nations withdrew ambassadors from Iran in protest, yet the US now targets millions without proof or justification, allegedly for opposing its interests. The author argues that if Europe condemned Iran for human rights violations, it should similarly condemn the US for its broader, unprovoked actions. The article calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, echoing the diplomatic response to Iran. It criticizes the US for reverting to "pre-historic justice" and using force to silence global justice-seeking voices, urging the world to uphold human rights principles and oppose such cruelty.
