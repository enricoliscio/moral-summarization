SUMMARY:
The US President has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of terrorism. This move is seen as a blatant violation of human rights, with no proof or reason provided. The author draws a parallel with the fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini against Salman Rushdie, which was also criticized by Western countries as an act of terrorism. The US action is deemed more egregious, as it targets millions of people without justification. The author argues that if European countries were genuine in their condemnation of Iran's human rights record, they should now recall their ambassadors from the US. The US is accused of trying to silence justice-seeking voices with brute force, and its inhuman behavior is seen as a threat to the hard-won discovery of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
