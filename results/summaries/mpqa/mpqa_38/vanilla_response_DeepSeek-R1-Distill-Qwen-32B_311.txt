Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally. It contrasts this with the reaction to the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, where Western countries condemned Iran for violating human rights. The summary should highlight the hypocrisy of the US's actions, the lack of justification, and the call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors. I should keep it under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Let me make sure to include the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: US President Bush has authorized the CIA to assassinate opponents worldwide, a move criticized as hypocritical given the US's role in the global fight against terrorism. The article draws parallels to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which faced international condemnation for violating human rights. The US's assassination directive, without evidence or justification, is seen as targeting millions for opposing American interests. The piece calls for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors from the US, echoing the earlier European move against Iran. It condemns the US for undermining human rights principles and warns against a regression to pre-historic justice, urging the world to reject such cruelty and uphold human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
