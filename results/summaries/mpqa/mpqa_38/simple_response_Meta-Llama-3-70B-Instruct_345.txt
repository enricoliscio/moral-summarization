SUMMARY:

The US President has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and hypocrisy. When Iran's Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet, Western countries protested, calling it an act of terrorism and a violation of human rights. Now, the US has issued a blanket assassination order without proof or reason, solely based on opposition to the US. This blatant disregard for human life warrants a unified response from Islamic countries, recalling their ambassadors from the US. The European countries, who previously withdrew their ambassadors from Iran, must do the same with the US, as the latter's actions violate the rights of millions. The US's actions are a cruel attempt to silence justice-seeking voices and justify its inhumane behavior. The world will not stand idly by as the US seeks to undermine the hard-won achievement of human rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
