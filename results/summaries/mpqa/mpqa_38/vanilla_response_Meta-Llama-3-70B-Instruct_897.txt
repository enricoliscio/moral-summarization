SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the US government's directive to the CIA to assassinate opponents worldwide, citing hypocrisy given the US claims to lead the fight against terrorism. The author recalls the international outcry against Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was deemed an act of terrorism and a violation of human rights. In contrast, the US has issued a blanket assassination order without proof or documentation, solely based on opposition to the US. The article argues that Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did with Iran, and that the US is attempting to justify its inhumane behavior through military might.
