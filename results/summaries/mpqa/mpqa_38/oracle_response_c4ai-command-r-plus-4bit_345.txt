SUMMARY: US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, a directive that contradicts the country's proclaimed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This order, issued without proof or reason, violates the rights of countless individuals, mirroring the protests against the fatwa on Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran. The double standard is evident as Western nations recalled their ambassadors from Iran over the fatwa, claiming human rights violations, yet remain silent on America's assassination order. This hypocrisy undermines the progress made in recognizing God-given human rights, with the US attempting to silence global cries for justice with explosive force. The Islamic world should respond by withdrawing ambassadors from the US, holding it accountable for its unjust behavior and preserving hard-won human rights achievements. This move would challenge the US's attempt to revert to pre-historic justice, where might made right. The author calls for a stand against US cruelty, urging the protection of human rights and global justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
