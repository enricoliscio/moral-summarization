SUMMARY:

The US President has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and hypocrisy accusations. This directive is reminiscent of the Imam's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was condemned by Western countries as an act of terrorism and a violation of human rights. However, the US order is more egregious, targeting millions of people without proof or justification, simply for opposing the US. The author argues that if European countries were genuine in their criticism of Iran, they should now recall their ambassadors from the US. The US is attempting to silence justice-seeking voices with military might, but this will not be tolerated. The author emphasizes that human rights, achieved after centuries of struggle, cannot be undone by US aggression.

END OF SUMMARY.
