SUMMARY:

The US President has ordered the CIA to assassinate opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and hypocrisy accusations. The author recalls the international backlash against Iran when Imam Khomeini issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet, with European countries recalling their ambassadors from Tehran. In contrast, the US has issued a blanket assassination order without proof or reason, simply due to opposition to the US. The author argues that if European countries were genuine in their human rights concerns, they should recall their ambassadors from the US, as the US is violating the rights of millions, not just one individual. The US is attempting to silence justice-seeking voices with military might, but this will not be tolerated. The world will not let human rights achievements be undone by such cruelty.

END OF SUMMARY.
