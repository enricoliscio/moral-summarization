SUMMARY: In a shocking move, US President Bush has ordered the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's claims of leading the fight against terrorism. This directive is a blatant violation of human rights and international law, as it targets millions of people without proof or reason. The order follows the US's decision to protest against a fatwa issued by the Imam, calling for Salman Rushdie's death for insulting the Prophet and the Koran. The Islamic Republic of Iran clarified that the fatwa upheld the rights of millions of Muslims worldwide, but Western countries still pressured Iran by recalling their ambassadors. Now, the US has issued an even more extreme directive, and Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors. The US's actions are a step back to pre-historic justice, and the world must not allow human rights achievements to be wasted away by the explosions of bombs. The US's behavior is inhumane and unjustified, and no country should tolerate such cruelty. END OF SUMMARY.
