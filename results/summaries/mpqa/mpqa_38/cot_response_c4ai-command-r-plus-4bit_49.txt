SUMMARY:
The US President has instructed the CIA to assassinate America's *opponents* worldwide, despite the country's supposed leadership in the fight against *terrorism*. This decision stands in stark contrast to the uproar caused when the Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the Koran. Western nations, self-proclaimed *supporters* of *human rights*, *protested*, calling the fatwa an *act of terrorism* that violated *international law* and *human rights principles*. The Islamic Republic of Iran clarified that the fatwa respected the rights of millions of Muslims worldwide, and was supported by *clerics* across the Islamic world. Now, the US has issued an *assassination order* without proof or *reason*, targeting those who oppose them and potentially violating the *rights* of countless innocent people. This hypocrisy is underscored by the fact that the US, in its quest for *justice*, is willing to resort to *cruelty* and ignore the *achievement* of recognizing and upholding *God-given human rights*, an *achievement* that has been made possible through centuries of *research*. The US believes it can drown out the *justice-seeking cries* of the world with its bombs and justify its *inhuman behavior*. Islamic nations should consider withdrawing their ambassadors from the US, just as European nations did with Iran, to send a clear message against such violations. END OF SUMMARY.
