Alright, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's content and the moral language used. The article talks about President Bush ordering the CIA to assassinate opponents, which is a strong moral statement. It compares this to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, where the US and Europe criticized Iran for violating human rights. Now, the US is doing something similar but on a larger scale, which the author finds hypocritical.

I need to identify the key morally framed words from the user's list. Words like "assassinate," "directive," "protested," "pressure," "violating," "order," "cruelty," etc., are important. The summary should include as many of these as possible without making it too long.

The structure should start by stating the main point: Bush ordering assassinations. Then, contrast it with the US and Europe's reaction to Iran's fatwa. Highlight the hypocrisy and the call for Islamic countries to withdraw ambassadors, just as Europe did with Iran. Conclude with the moral implications and the potential for global pushback against the US actions.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows logically. Also, I need to use the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
US President Bush has issued a directive ordering the CIA to assassinate America's opponents globally, a move that raises serious moral and legal concerns. This directive comes as the US claims to lead the fight against terrorism. The article draws a moral comparison to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which was widely condemned by Western countries for violating human rights and international law. European countries recalled their ambassadors from Iran to exert pressure, but the article argues that the US is now violating the rights of millions without proof, reason, or documentation, solely for opposing its interests. The author suggests that if European countries were honest in their criticism of Iran, they should now recall their ambassadors from the US for its far-reaching cruelty. The article condemns the US for reverting to pre-historic justice and wasting the hard-won discovery of God-given human rights. It criticizes the US for silencing global justice-seeking cries with explosions and justifying its inhuman behavior. The author calls for Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US, emphasizing that no country should tolerate such cruelty or allow human rights to be wasted.  
END OF SUMMARY.
