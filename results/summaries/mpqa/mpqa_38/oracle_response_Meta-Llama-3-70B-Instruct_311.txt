SUMMARY:

US President Bush has issued a directive to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and hypocrisy accusations. The move is seen as a violation of human rights and international law, with no proof, reason, or documentation to justify the order. This is in stark contrast to the international outcry when Iran's Imam issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet and the holy Koran. The Imam's edict was deemed an act of terrorism, yet the US is now engaging in a similar act of violating human rights on a massive scale. The author argues that Islamic countries should withdraw their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did from Iran, to protest this cruelty. The US is determined to take justice back to pre-historic times, but the world will not allow this human achievement to be wasted away. The US thinks it can silence justice-seeking cries with explosions and justify its inhuman behavior, but this will not be tolerated.

END OF SUMMARY.
