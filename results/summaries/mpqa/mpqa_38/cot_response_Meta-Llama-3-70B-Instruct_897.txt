SUMMARY:
US President Bush has issued a directive to the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, sparking outrage and accusations of terrorism. This move is seen as a blatant violation of human rights, with no proof, reason, or documentation to justify the killings. The author draws a parallel with the fatwa issued by the Imam against Salman Rushdie, which was also criticized by Western countries as an act of terrorism. The US is now guilty of violating the rights of millions of people, and it is only fitting that Islamic countries withdraw their ambassadors in protest. The author condemns the US for trying to justify its inhuman behavior through violence and intimidation, and warns that no country will tolerate this cruelty. The discovery of God-given human rights, achieved after thousands of years of research, must not be wasted away.
END OF SUMMARY.
