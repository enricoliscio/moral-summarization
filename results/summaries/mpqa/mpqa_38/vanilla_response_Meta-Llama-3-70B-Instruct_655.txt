SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the US government's decision to authorize the CIA to assassinate its opponents worldwide, citing it as a violation of human rights. The author draws a parallel with the fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini against Salman Rushdie, which was condemned by Western countries as an act of terrorism. The article argues that the US directive is a more severe violation of human rights, as it targets millions of people without proof or documentation, solely based on opposition to the US. The author calls on Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the US and for European countries to recall their ambassadors from the US, as they did with Iran, to protest this violation of human rights. The article concludes that the US is attempting to undermine the progress made in human rights, and that no country will tolerate such cruelty.
