SUMMARY: In a shocking development, US President Bush has instructed the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, contradicting America's self-proclaimed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This directive mirrors the hypocrisy displayed by Western nations during the Salman Rushdie fatwa, where they condemned the Islamic Republic of Iran for defending the honor of the Prophet and the Koran. The fatwa, clarified by Iran, was understood by the world as a defense of the rights of millions of believers, yet Western nations, supposedly champions of human rights, remained silent on Bush's assassination order targeting millions without evidence. Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors from the US, just as European countries did with Iran. The US, reeling from the September 11 attacks, seeks to regress justice to pre-historic times, ignoring the hard-won human rights achievements of humanity. The US believes it can drown out the calls for justice from the global community with its bombs and justify its inhumane actions through brute force. END OF SUMMARY.
