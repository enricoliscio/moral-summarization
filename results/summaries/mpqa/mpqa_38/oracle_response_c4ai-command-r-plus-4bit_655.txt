SUMMARY: In a disturbing development, US President Bush has directed the CIA to assassinate America's opponents worldwide, despite the country's professed leadership in the fight against terrorism. This order tramples on human rights and international law, echoing the unjustified protests against the fatwa on Salman Rushdie, which defended the honor of the Prophet and the Koran. The Islamic Republic of Iran rightfully clarified that insulting the Prophet violates the rights of millions of Muslims, yet the US now issues an assassination order without proof or reason, targeting those who oppose its hegemony. Islamic countries should respond by withdrawing their ambassadors from the US, mirroring the coordinated move by European countries against Iran. The double standards are evident, as the US attempts to mask its injustice and cruelty with bomb explosions, disregarding the principles of justice and human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
