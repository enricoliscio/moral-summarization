Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify the morally framed words first. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about China criticizing the US human rights report. The key points are that China is accusing the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. They mention police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, lack of personal safety, military operations infringing on sovereignty, and pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this report in response to the US's annual report that usually accuses China.

Now, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I should look for words that carry a strong moral connotation. Let me go through the article again. Words like "criticizes," "accusing," "abuses," "blind eye," "infringing," "slammed," "distorted," "accused," "violations." These words all carry a moral judgment, either positive or negative.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping these moral words as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I should structure it to highlight China's criticism of the US, the specific issues mentioned, and the context of the annual reports.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too verbose. Let me piece it together: China criticizes the US report, accuses them of ignoring their own problems, lists specific issues, condemns military actions, and responds to the US's accusations. I'll make sure to include all the morally framed words identified earlier to preserve the author's framing.

Wait, did I miss any morally framed words? Let me check again. "Criticizes," "accusing," "abuses," "blind eye," "infringing," "slammed," "distorted," "accused," "violations." I think that's all. Okay, time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

**STEP 1:**  
* Criticizes  
* Accusing  
* Abuses  
* Blind eye  
* Infringing  
* Slammed  
* Distorted  
* Accused  
* Violations  

**SUMMARY:**  
China has released its annual report criticizing the United States' human rights record, accusing Washington of ignoring its own domestic issues while condemning others. The report highlights police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the U.S., while also condemning U.S. military operations and overseas troop presence as violations of other nations' sovereignty. Additionally, it condemns the U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this report in response to the U.S. State Department's annual global human rights report, which often accuses China of human rights abuses. The Chinese report accuses the U.S. of hypocritically acting as a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own problems.  
END OF SUMMARY.
