Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about China criticizing the US human rights report. It mentions that China released its annual report on the US, accusing them of ignoring their own human rights issues while criticizing others. The report lists police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and troop deployments. Additionally, China points out that the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol.

China releases this report annually in response to the US State Department's report, which usually accuses China of human rights abuses. The Chinese report criticizes the US for acting as a global judge on human rights while ignoring their own problems.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll include the main points: China's annual report, the accusations against the US, the specific issues mentioned, and the context of responding to the US report. I'll structure it to highlight the mutual criticism between the two countries.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check for any unnecessary details to keep it brief. Also, I need to make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.
