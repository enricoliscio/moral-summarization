SUMMARY:
China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, slamming the administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. China claims the US is "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. The report criticizes the US for assuming the role of "world judge of human rights" and distorting human rights conditions in many countries, including China, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems. The report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. China's report aims to highlight the US's own human rights issues, accusing it of being hypocritical in its criticism of other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
