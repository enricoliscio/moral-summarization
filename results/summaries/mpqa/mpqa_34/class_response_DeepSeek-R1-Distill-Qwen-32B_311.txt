Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read the article carefully. It's about China criticizing the US human rights report. The key points are that China published its annual report, accusing the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. They mention police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, lack of safety, military actions infringing on sovereignty, and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this report in response to the US report that usually accuses China of widespread human rights abuses.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: turning, abuses, discrimination, safety, infringing, withdrawing, widespread, distorted, accused, violations. I should make sure to include these words where appropriate.

I'll start by stating that China criticized the US report, highlighting the hypocrisy. Then list the issues China points out: police abuses, poverty, discrimination, safety concerns. Mention the military actions as infringing on sovereignty. Include the withdrawal from Kyoto. Finally, note that China responds to the US report that accuses them of widespread violations, emphasizing the distortion of facts.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral terms are preserved. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without losing the moral framing.
