Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to ensure the summary reflects the original's tone and perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. China is criticizing the US human rights report, pointing out issues like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. They also accuse the US of military overreach and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. The article mentions that China releases this report annually in response to the US's own human rights report, which often criticizes China.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I should maintain the critical tone towards the US while highlighting China's counterpoints. It's important to include all key accusations: police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, military actions, and environmental policy. Also, note that China responds annually to the US report, which usually accuses China of human rights issues.

I should structure the summary to first state that China has criticized the US report, then list the main points of their criticism, and finally mention the annual nature of the response. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically and captures the essence without unnecessary details.

Let me draft it: China has criticized the US human rights report, highlighting issues like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and personal safety in the US. They also accuse the US of military overreach and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this report annually in response to the US's own report, which often accuses China of human rights abuses. This maintains the moral framing by showing China's perspective on the US's hypocrisy.

I think that covers all the necessary points concisely. I'll make sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

The report is released annually in response to the U.S. State Department's global human rights report, which often criticizes China for human rights abuses.
