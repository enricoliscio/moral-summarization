SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, while accusing the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and overseas troop deployments. The report also condemns the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China's report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of widespread abuses. China argues that the US is guilty of the same human rights violations it accuses others of, and that it should focus on addressing its own problems rather than acting as a "world judge of human rights". The report suggests that the US is guilty of hypocrisy and selective outrage, and that it should take a more introspective approach to human rights.
