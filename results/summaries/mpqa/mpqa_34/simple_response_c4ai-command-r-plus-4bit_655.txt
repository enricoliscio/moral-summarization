SUMMARY: In a moralistic tone, China criticizes the United States for its hypocrisy and self-righteousness in matters of human rights. While the US positions itself as the "world judge of human rights," China's report reveals how the US turns a blind eye to its own human rights violations while condemning other nations. The report highlights issues within the US such as police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety, as well as the infringement of other nations' sovereignty through military interventions. China's annual response to the US State Department's report on global human rights conditions, underscores the US's selective and biased approach to human rights, ignoring its own shortcomings while judging others. This exchange between the two nations reveals a complex dynamic where each accuses the other of human rights abuses, with China emphasizing the moral responsibility of those who claim to judge and condemn others.
