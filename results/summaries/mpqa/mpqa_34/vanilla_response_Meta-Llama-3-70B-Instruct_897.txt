SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for ignoring its own human rights abuses while condemning other countries. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. The report slams the Bush administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China releases the report in response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. The Chinese report accuses the US of distorting human rights conditions in many countries, including China, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems.
