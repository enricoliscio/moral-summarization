SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for ignoring abuses in its own country while criticizing others. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and stationing forces overseas. Additionally, the report slams the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. This report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. China's report claims the US is hypocritical, distorting human rights conditions in other countries while ignoring its own problems.
