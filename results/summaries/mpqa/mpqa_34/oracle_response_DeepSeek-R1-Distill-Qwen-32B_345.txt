Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should preserve. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

China is criticizing the US human rights report. They're accusing the US of ignoring their own human rights issues while criticizing others. The report mentions police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also talks about the US infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and stationing forces overseas. Additionally, they're upset that the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol.

The author used specific words like "abuses," "poverty," "discrimination," "infringing," "operations," "stationing," "withdrew," "distorted," and "violations." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to first state that China criticized the US report. Then, list the main points from the Chinese report: police abuses, poverty, discrimination, lack of safety, military actions infringing sovereignty, and withdrawal from Kyoto. Also, mention that China releases this report annually in response to the US report, which usually accuses China.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without making it too lengthy.
