SUMMARY: 
China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing America for its double standards on human rights issues. The report, issued by China's State Council, accused the US of ignoring its own human rights abuses while condemning other nations for theirs. It listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and a lack of personal safety within the US, as well as the US military's infringement on the sovereignty of other nations. The report also condemned the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This report comes in response to the US State Department's annual human rights report, which often criticizes China for alleged human rights violations. China's report highlighted the hypocrisy of the US, accusing it of distorting the human rights records of other countries while failing to address its own issues. China's report is a stark reminder that the US must address its own human rights shortcomings before passing judgment on others. END OF SUMMARY.
