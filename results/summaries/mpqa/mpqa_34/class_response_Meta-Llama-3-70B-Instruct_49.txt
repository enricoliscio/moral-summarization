SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of "turning a blind eye" to its own abuses while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. Furthermore, the report slams the US administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China's report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. China argues that the US is guilty of "distorting" human rights conditions in many countries, including China, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems.
