Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article carefully. 

The article is about China criticizing the US human rights report. China accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. They mention police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of safety. Also, China points out US military actions infringing on sovereignty and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. The summary needs to include the morally charged words: turning, abuses, discrimination, safety, infringing, withdrawing, widespread, distorted, accused, violations.

I should structure the summary to highlight China's criticism, the issues they point out in the US, and the context of the annual reports. I need to make sure each moral term is included where appropriate. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll check each point from the article to include all necessary elements without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
China has criticized the US human rights report, accusing the US of ignoring its own human rights abuses while condemning others. The Chinese report, released by the State Council's Information Office, highlighted police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accused the US of "wantonly infringing" on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and overseas troop deployments. Additionally, China condemned the Bush administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. The report criticized the US for distorting human rights conditions globally, including in China, while overlooking its own violations. China releases this report annually in response to the US State Department's global human rights assessment, which often accuses China of widespread abuses. END OF SUMMARY.
