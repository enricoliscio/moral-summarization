Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about China criticizing the US human rights report. China's report accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. They mention police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. Also, the US is accused of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and stationing forces abroad. Plus, they withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words listed are: turning, abuses, poverty, discrimination, lack, infringing, operations, stationing, withdrawing, distorted, violations. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I'll start by noting the key points: China's annual report, the accusations against the US, the specific issues mentioned, and the context of responding to the US report. I'll structure the summary to include these elements, using the moral terms to frame the narrative.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, connecting the accusations and the context of the reports. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring that all the moral terms are included and that the framing is maintained. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review it to make sure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral perspective intended by the author.
