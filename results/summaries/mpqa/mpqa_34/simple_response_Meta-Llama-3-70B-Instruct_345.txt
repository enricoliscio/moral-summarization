SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing the US for hypocrisy and double standards. The report accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights abuses, including police brutality, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety, while criticizing other countries for similar issues. China also condemns the US for infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases. The report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often criticizes China for human rights abuses. China argues that the US is acting as a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own problems, and that this hypocrisy undermines the US's credibility on human rights issues.
