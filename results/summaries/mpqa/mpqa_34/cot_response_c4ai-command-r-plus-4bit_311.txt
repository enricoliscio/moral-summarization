SUMMARY: China has issued a report criticizing the United States for its human rights record, accusing it of turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses while criticizing other countries. The Chinese report listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accused the US of infringing on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and of withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. The report was released in response to a US State Department report that accused China of widespread human rights violations, distorting the human rights conditions in many countries while ignoring its own problems. China's report highlights the hypocrisy of the US in assuming the role of a "world judge of human rights" while failing to address its own moral shortcomings. END OF SUMMARY.
