SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for hypocrisy and double standards. The report accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights abuses, including police brutality, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety, while criticizing other countries for similar issues. China also condemns the US for infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and stationing troops overseas. The report slams the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of widespread abuses. China argues that the US is assuming the role of "world judge of human rights‚Äù while ignoring its own problems, and that this hypocrisy undermines its credibility to criticize others.
