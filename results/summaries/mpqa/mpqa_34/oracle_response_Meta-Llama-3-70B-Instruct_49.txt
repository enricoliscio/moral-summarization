SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of "turning a blind eye" to its own "abuses" and "violations" while criticizing other countries. The report highlights evidence of police "abuses", "poverty", "racial discrimination", and "lack" of personal safety in the US. It also condemns the US for "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military "operations" and "stationing" US forces overseas. Furthermore, the report slams the US administration for "withdrawing" from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China's report is a response to the US State Department's report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of widespread "abuses". The Chinese report accuses the US of "distorting" human rights conditions in many countries, including China, while ignoring its own "human rights-related problems".
