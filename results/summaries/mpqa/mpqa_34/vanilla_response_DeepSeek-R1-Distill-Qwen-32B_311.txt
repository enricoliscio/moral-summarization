Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about China criticizing the US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article says that China released its annual report on human rights in the US, accusing the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. The report, from China's State Council, lists issues like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and troop deployments. Additionally, it mentions the US withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, which China disapproves of.

The US, on the other hand, releases a report that usually accuses China of human rights abuses. China's report criticizes the US for acting as a "world judge" and ignoring its own problems. The summary needs to capture these key points concisely, under 200 words. I should make sure to include the main accusations from China, the context of the annual report, and the mutual accusations between the two countries. I'll structure it to first state that China criticized the US report, then list the main points of their accusations, and conclude with the mutual nature of their criticism. I'll keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary details.
