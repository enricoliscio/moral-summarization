Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. China is criticizing the US human rights report, pointing out issues like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. They also accuse the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and stationing forces overseas. Plus, the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, which China mentions.

I need to keep the moral words like "abuses," "poverty," "discrimination," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by stating China's criticism, listing the issues they pointed out, and mention the US's hypocrisy by criticizing others while ignoring their own problems. I should also note that this is an annual response to the US report.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too wordy. Maybe start with China's action, then list the accusations, and end with the context of the annual report. That should cover everything while preserving the moral framing.
