SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of "turning a blind eye" to its own abuses, including police brutality, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. The report also condemned the US for "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. Furthermore, the report criticized the US President's administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. The Chinese report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of widespread abuses. China argues that the US is guilty of "distorting" human rights conditions in other countries, including China, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems.
