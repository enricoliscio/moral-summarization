SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing the US for ignoring its own human rights issues while scrutinizing other countries. The report, issued by China's State Council, highlighted issues such as police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also criticized US military interventions overseas and the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. This report comes as a response to the US State Department's annual human rights report, which often criticizes China. China's report accused the US of acting as a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own shortcomings.
