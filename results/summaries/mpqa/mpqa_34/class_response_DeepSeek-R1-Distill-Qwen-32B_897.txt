Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the specific words to keep. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

China is criticizing the US human rights report. They're accusing the US of ignoring its own issues while pointing fingers at others. The report mentions police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of safety in the US. It also talks about military actions infringing on sovereignty and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this report annually in response to the US report that usually accuses China of human rights abuses.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally charged words: turning, abuses, discrimination, safety, infringing, withdrawing, widespread, distorted, accused, violations. I should structure the summary to highlight these points clearly.

I'll start by stating China's issuance of the report and its accusations. Then, list the issues they pointed out in the US. Mention the military actions and Kyoto withdrawal. Finally, note that this is an annual response to the US report, which often accuses China.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points and moral words are included.
