SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing other countries. The report, issued by China's State Council, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also criticized US military operations and the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. This report is released annually in response to the US State Department's report on global human rights conditions, which often criticizes China. China's report claims that the US acts as a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own issues and accuses other countries of violations.
