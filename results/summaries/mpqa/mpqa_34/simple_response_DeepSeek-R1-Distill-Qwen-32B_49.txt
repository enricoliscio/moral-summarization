Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about China criticizing the US human rights report. China's report accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. They mention police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. Also, China points out the US's military actions and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this report annually in response to the US's report that usually accuses China.

Now, I need to capture the essence without losing the moral perspective. The moral framing is about hypocrisyâ€”accusing others while ignoring one's own problems. I should highlight that China is pointing out the US's double standards.

I should structure the summary to first state that China criticized the US report, then list the main accusations, and mention the annual response to the US report. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and making sure it's clear and includes the moral angle.

Let me draft it:

China criticizes the US human rights report, highlighting US hypocrisy. The report accuses the US of ignoring its own issues like police abuse, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of safety while criticizing others. It also condemns US military actions and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this annually in response to the US report that accuses China. The moral framing emphasizes the US's role as a hypocritical judge.

Wait, that's a bit too brief. Let me expand a bit to include all points clearly, ensuring it's under 200 words.

China has criticized the US human rights report, accusing the US of hypocrisy. The report, published by the Information Office of the State Council, lists US issues like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. It also condemns the US for military actions and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. China releases this annually in response to the US report, which often accuses China. The moral framing highlights the US's role as a hypocritical judge, ignoring its own problems while criticizing others.

That should cover all the key points and maintain the moral perspective.
