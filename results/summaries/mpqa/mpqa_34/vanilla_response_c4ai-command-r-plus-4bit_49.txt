SUMMARY: China released its annual report on human rights abuses in the United States, accusing the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing other countries. The report, issued by China's Cabinet, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also criticized the US for its military interventions overseas and its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. This report is China's response to the US State Department's report on global human rights conditions, which typically criticizes China. China's report highlighted the irony of the US acting as a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own human rights issues.
