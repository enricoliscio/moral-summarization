SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report criticizing the United States for its human rights record, accusing it of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other nations. The report listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety within the United States. It also charged the US with infringing on the sovereignty of other nations and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This report comes in response to the annual US State Department report on global human rights conditions, which has accused China of widespread human rights violations. China's report condemns the US for acting as the "world judge of human rights," while allegedly ignoring its own human rights issues. 

China's report highlights the hypocrisy of a nation that criticizes others while allegedly committing its own abuses. The annual exchange of reports has become a tit-for-tat ritual, with each country accusing the other of distortions and violations.
