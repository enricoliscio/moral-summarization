Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first.

China is criticizing the US human rights report. They're pointing out that the US talks about other countries' human rights issues but ignores their own problems. The Chinese report mentions police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. They also accuse the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions. Plus, they're upset that the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol.

The author used specific moral words like "turning a blind eye," "abuses," "discrimination," "safety," "infringing," "withdrawing," "widespread," "distorted," "accused," and "violations." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight China's criticism, the points they made about the US, and the moral framing. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include the key moral terms without making it too lengthy.

Let me draft it: Start by stating China's criticism of the US report. Mention the specific issues they pointed outâ€”police abuses, poverty, discrimination, safety. Then talk about the US's military actions and withdrawal from Kyoto. Conclude by noting that China releases this report annually in response to the US's own report, which usually accuses China.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral terms. Let me check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, ensure that the summary accurately reflects the original article's content and moral perspective.
