SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of "turning a blind eye" to its own abuses, including police brutality, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. The report criticizes the US for "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. It also slams the US administration for "withdrawing" from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China's report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of "widespread" abuses. The Chinese report argues that the US is guilty of "distorting" human rights conditions in other countries, including China, while ignoring its own "human rights-related problems". The report accuses the US of hypocrisy, saying it assumes the role of "world judge of human rights" while violating human rights itself.
