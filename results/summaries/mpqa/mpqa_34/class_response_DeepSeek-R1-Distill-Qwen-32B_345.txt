Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. China is criticizing the US for its human rights report, pointing out issues like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. They also accuse the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. The summary should include the morally charged words like "abuses," "discrimination," "safety," "infringing," etc. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll structure it by stating China's response, listing their accusations, and highlighting the hypocrisy angle. I'll also mention the annual nature of these reports to show the ongoing tension. Finally, I'll end with the moral critique against the US. Let me put this together clearly and concisely.

Additionally, China condemns the Bush administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This report is China's response to the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which often accuses China of widespread human rights violations. China accuses the U.S. of distorting human rights conditions globally, including in China, while ignoring its own problems. The Chinese report criticizes the U.S. for acting as a "world judge of human rights" while perpetrating its own violations. END OF SUMMARY.
