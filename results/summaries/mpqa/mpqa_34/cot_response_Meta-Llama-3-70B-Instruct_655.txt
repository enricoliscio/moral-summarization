SUMMARY:
China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. China also accuses the US of "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. Furthermore, the report slams the US President's administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China's report is a response to the US State Department's report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. China claims the US is distorting human rights conditions in many countries, including China, and accuses them of human rights violations, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems.
