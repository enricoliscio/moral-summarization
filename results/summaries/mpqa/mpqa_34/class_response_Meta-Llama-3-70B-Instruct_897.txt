SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report highlights evidence of police abuses, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, as well as the country's wanton infringement on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and overseas troop deployments. The report also slams the US administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases, a move that exacerbates widespread environmental violations. By releasing this report, China is pushing back against the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which typically accuses China of widespread abuses. China argues that the US is distorting human rights conditions in many countries, including China, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems. END OF SUMMARY.
