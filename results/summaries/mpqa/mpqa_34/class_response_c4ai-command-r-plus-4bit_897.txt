SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report on human rights violations in the United States, accusing the US of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other nations. The report, released annually by the Information Office of the State Council, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also slammed the US for its military interventions overseas and its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. This report comes in response to the US State Department's own report on global human rights conditions, which accused China of widespread human rights abuses. China's report condemns the US for acting as the "world judge of human rights," while ignoring its own problems and infringing on the sovereignty of other nations.
