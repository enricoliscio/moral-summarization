SUMMARY: China criticizes the United States for its hypocrisy and double standards when it comes to human rights, accusing it of ignoring its own abuses while criticizing other nations. The annual report by China's State Council highlights issues in the US such as police brutality, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety, as well as its interference in other countries' sovereignty and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China's report is a response to the US State Department's own human rights report, which condemns China for alleged human rights violations. The Chinese report condemns the US for acting as a "world judge of human rights" while failing to address its own issues, demonstrating a clear moral stance against hypocrisy and a call for mutual accountability in upholding human rights.
