SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, as well as the country's military interventions and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China argues that the US is quick to judge other countries' human rights records while ignoring its own problems. The report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of widespread abuses. China accuses the US of being a "world judge of human rights" that distorts human rights conditions in other countries, including China, while ignoring its own issues. The report is seen as a moral rebuke to the US, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection and accountability in human rights.
