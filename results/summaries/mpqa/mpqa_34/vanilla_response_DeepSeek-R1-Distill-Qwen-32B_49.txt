Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about China criticizing the US human rights report. China released their annual report, pointing out issues in the US like police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. They also accuse the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol.

I should include the main points: China's criticism, the issues they highlighted in the US, their accusation of the US ignoring its own problems while judging others, and that this is in response to the US report that usually criticizes China.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating China's action, list the criticisms, mention the US military operations and Kyoto withdrawal, and note the annual response to the US report. I'll end by highlighting the hypocrisy accusation.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without getting too detailed. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.
