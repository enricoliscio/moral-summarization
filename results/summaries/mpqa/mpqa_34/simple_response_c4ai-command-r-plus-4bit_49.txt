SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights abuses in the United States, highlighting the hypocrisy of the US in criticizing other nations while ignoring its own shortcomings. The report, released by the Information Office of the State Council, presents evidence of police brutality, racial discrimination, poverty, and lack of personal safety in the US, while also criticizing the US for its aggressive military interventions overseas and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China's report serves as a response to the US State Department's own report on global human rights conditions, which accuses China of human rights violations. The Chinese report emphasizes the US's selective morality and disregard for the sovereignty of other nations, exposing the hypocrisy and double standards often employed by those in positions of power and influence.
