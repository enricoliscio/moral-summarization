SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report on the human rights record of the United States, highlighting its hypocrisy in criticizing other nations while ignoring its own issues. The annual report, released by the Information Office of the State Council, details evidence of police brutality, racial inequality, poverty, and environmental negligence within the US. It also condemns the US for its military interventions overseas, accusing it of violating the sovereignty of other nations and causing harm to innocent civilians. This report serves as a response to the US State Department's own human rights report, which often criticizes China while ignoring the moral implications of its own actions. China's report underscores the importance of recognizing one's own moral shortcomings before passing judgment on others, and it calls into question the ethical basis for the US's self-appointed role as the "world judge of human rights." End of summary. END OF SUMMARY.
