SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights violations in the United States, accusing the US of hypocrisy in its human rights stance. The report by the Information Office of the State Council listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and a lack of personal safety in the US, contrasting this with the US's criticism of other nations' human rights records. China's report also criticized the US for its military interventions overseas and its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, demonstrating a disregard for the sovereignty and environmental well-being of other nations. This report serves as a response to the US State Department's own report on global human rights conditions, which condemns China for alleged human rights abuses. China's report highlights the US's tendency to ignore its own human rights issues while passing judgment on other countries, a stance that China finds distorted and hypocritical.
