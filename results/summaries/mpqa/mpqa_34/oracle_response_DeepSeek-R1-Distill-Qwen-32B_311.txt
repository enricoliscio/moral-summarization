Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about China criticizing the US human rights report. China accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. They mention police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. Also, China points out that the US is infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and stationing forces abroad. Additionally, the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, which China criticizes.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words listed are: turning, abuses, poverty, discrimination, lack, infringing, operations, stationing, withdrawing, distorted, violations.

I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should structure the summary to first mention China's response to the US report, then list the accusations against the US, and finally note that China releases this report annually in response to the US report. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to maintain the framing.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.
