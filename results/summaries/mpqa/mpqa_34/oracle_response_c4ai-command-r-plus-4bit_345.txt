SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report on the human rights record of the United States, accusing the US of turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses while criticizing other nations. The annual report listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety within the US, as well as the US government's infringement on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and the stationing of US forces overseas. It also criticized the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, demonstrating a disregard for global environmental concerns. This report serves as a response to the US State Department's own report on global human rights conditions, which accuses China of human rights violations. China's report highlights the hypocrisy of the US in assuming the role of a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own domestic issues and violating the sovereignty of other nations. China urges the US to address its own human rights-related problems and to respect the rights and choices of other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
