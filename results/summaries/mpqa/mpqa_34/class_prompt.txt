China criticizes US human rights report BEIJING - China issued its annual report on human rights in the United States on Monday, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report by the Information Office of the State Council, China's Cabinet, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination and lack of personal safety in the United States, the official Xinhua news agency said. It also accused Washington of "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas, Xinhua said. The report also slammed US President George W. Bush's administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China releases the report every year in response to a US State Department report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. The US report came out last week. "Once again the United States, assuming the role of `world judge of human rights' has distorted human rights conditions in many countries and regions in the world, including China, and accused them of human rights violations, all the while turning a blind eye to its own human rights-related problems," the Chinese report said.
