SUMMARY: 
China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, condemning the US for its hypocrisy in criticizing other nations for human rights abuses while ignoring its own shortcomings. The Chinese report, issued by the State Council, highlights police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of violating the sovereignty of other nations through its military interventions and of neglecting its environmental responsibilities by withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This report serves as a response to the US State Department's annual human rights report, which often condemns China for alleged human rights violations. China's report asserts that the US acts as a "world judge of human rights," turning a blind eye to its own issues while unjustly judging other countries. The Chinese report underscores the need for all nations, including the US, to address their own human rights issues rather than engaging in selective condemnation.
