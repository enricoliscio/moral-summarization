SUMMARY:
China has released its annual human rights report on the United States, criticizing the US for its alleged human rights abuses and hypocrisy in criticizing other nations while ignoring its own issues. The Chinese report, issued by the Information Office of the State Council, highlights police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and a lack of personal safety in the US, as well as the US military's infringement on the sovereignty of other nations. It also condemns the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. This report is China's response to the US State Department's own human rights report, which accuses China of widespread human rights abuses. The Chinese report accuses the US of acting as the "world judge of human rights," ignoring its own human rights-related *problems* while *accusing* other countries of the same. China's report underscores the ongoing tensions between the two countries over human rights and underscores the differing perspectives on this issue.
