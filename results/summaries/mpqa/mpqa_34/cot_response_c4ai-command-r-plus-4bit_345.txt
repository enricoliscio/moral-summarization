SUMMARY:
China has issued a report criticizing the United States for its human rights abuses and hypocrisy in assuming the role of "world judge of human rights." The Chinese report accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights issues, including police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and a lack of personal safety. It also condemns the US for infringing on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This report is released annually in response to the US State Department's global human rights report, which often accuses China of human rights violations. China's report highlights the US' double standards and selective morality in judging other countries while ignoring its own human rights shortcomings. China urges the US to address its own issues and respect the sovereignty and choices of other nations.
