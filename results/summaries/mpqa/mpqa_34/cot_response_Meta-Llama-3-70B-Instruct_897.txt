SUMMARY:
China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, and slams the US President George W. Bush's administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China claims the US is "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. The report asserts that the US is guilty of "distorting" human rights conditions in many countries, including China, and accuses them of human rights violations, while ignoring its own human rights-related problems. The report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. END OF SUMMARY.
