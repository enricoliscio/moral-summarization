SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries for theirs. The report lists evidence of police abuses, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, and slams the US for "wantonly infringing" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas. The report also criticizes the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases. China's report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses. China argues that the US is guilty of distorted reporting, accusing other countries of human rights violations while ignoring its own problems. By doing so, the US is assuming the role of "world judge of human rights‚Äù and failing to address its own human rights-related issues. END OF SUMMARY.
