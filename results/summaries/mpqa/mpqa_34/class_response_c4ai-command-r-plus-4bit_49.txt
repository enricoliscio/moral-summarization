SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report on human rights violations in the United States, accusing the US of turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses while criticizing other nations. The report, released annually by China's State Council, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also charged the US with infringing on the sovereignty of other nations through military actions and withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This report is China's response to the US State Department's global human rights report, which criticizes China for alleged widespread human rights violations. China's report condemns the US for acting as the "world judge of human rights," distorting the human rights situation in other countries, and ignoring its own problems.
