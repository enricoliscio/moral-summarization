SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for hypocrisy and double standards. The report accuses the US of ignoring its own human rights abuses, including police brutality, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety. It also condemns the US for infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and overseas military presence. Furthermore, the report slams the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which often accuses China of widespread abuses. The Chinese report argues that the US is guilty of the same human rights violations it accuses other countries of, and that it should focus on addressing its own problems rather than acting as a "world judge of human rights".
