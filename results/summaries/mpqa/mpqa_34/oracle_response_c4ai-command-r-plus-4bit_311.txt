SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report on the human rights record of the United States, accusing the country of turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses while criticizing other nations. The report listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety within the US, as well as the infringement on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and the stationing of US forces abroad. It also criticized the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. This annual response to the US State Department's report on global human rights conditions highlights what China sees as American hypocrisy in assuming the role of "world judge of human rights," while ignoring its own human rights-related problems and distorting the human rights conditions in other countries, including China. China's report underscores the country's perspective on the US's approach to human rights, emphasizing its own interpretation of moral violations and the perceived double standards at play. END OF SUMMARY.
