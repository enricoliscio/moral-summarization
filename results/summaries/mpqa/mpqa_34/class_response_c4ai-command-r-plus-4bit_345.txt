SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing report on human rights violations in the United States, accusing the US of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other nations. The report, released annually by China's State Council, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also criticized the US for its military interventions overseas and its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. This report comes in response to the US State Department's own report on global human rights conditions, which accused China of widespread human rights abuses. China's report countered that the US acts as a "world judge of human rights," distorting the human rights conditions in other countries while ignoring its own problems. 

China's report highlights the ongoing tensions between the two countries over human rights issues, with each accusing the other of abuses and violations. The report also brings attention to the moral and ethical implications of US foreign policy and its impact on global perceptions of the country's commitment to human rights.
