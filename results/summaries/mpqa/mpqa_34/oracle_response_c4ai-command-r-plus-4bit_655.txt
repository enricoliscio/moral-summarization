SUMMARY: China has released its annual report on human rights violations in the United States, accusing the US of turning a blind eye to its own abuses while criticizing other nations. The report highlighted issues such as police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and a lack of personal safety within the US, as well as the US government's infringement on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and the stationing of US forces abroad. Additionally, the report criticized the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, demonstrating a disregard for global environmental efforts. This report serves as a response to the US State Department's own report on global human rights conditions, which criticized China. China's report underscores the hypocrisy of the US in assuming the role of a "world judge of human rights" while ignoring its own human rights issues and distorting the human rights conditions in other countries.
END OF SUMMARY.
