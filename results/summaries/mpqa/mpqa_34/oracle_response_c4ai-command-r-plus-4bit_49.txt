SUMMARY: In a yearly report on human rights, China criticized the United States for turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses while scrutinizing other nations. The Chinese report, issued by the State Council, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accused the US of infringing on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing troops abroad. The report further criticized the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. China's report was released in response to a US State Department report that accused China of human rights violations. China denounced the US for acting as the "world judge of human rights," distorting the human rights situation in other countries, and ignoring its own human rights issues. The Chinese report highlights the ongoing exchange of accusations between the two countries regarding human rights abuses and violations.
