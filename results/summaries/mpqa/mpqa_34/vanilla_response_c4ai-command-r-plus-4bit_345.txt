SUMMARY: In response to a US State Department report on global human rights conditions, China released its annual report on human rights abuses in the United States. The Chinese report accused the US of ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing other countries. It listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US, as well as the US government's infringement on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. China's report also criticized the US for acting as a "world judge of human rights" and distorting human rights conditions in other countries while ignoring its own problems. The Chinese report was issued by the Information Office of the State Council and comes as a response to the US report released last week, which accused China of widespread human rights abuses.
