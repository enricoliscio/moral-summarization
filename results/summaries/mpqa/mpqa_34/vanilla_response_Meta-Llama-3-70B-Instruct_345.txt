SUMMARY:

China has released its annual report on human rights in the United States, criticizing Washington for ignoring its own human rights abuses while condemning other countries. The report lists evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military operations and overseas military presence. Additionally, the report slams the US for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases. The report is a response to the US State Department's annual report on global human rights conditions, which typically accuses China of widespread abuses. China's report argues that the US is hypocritical in its criticism of other countries while ignoring its own human rights issues.
