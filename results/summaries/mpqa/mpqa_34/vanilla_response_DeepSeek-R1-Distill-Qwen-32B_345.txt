Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about China criticizing the US human rights report. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article says that China issued its annual report on human rights in the US, accusing the US of ignoring its own issues while criticizing others. The report mentions police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, and lack of personal safety in the US. It also accuses the US of infringing on other nations' sovereignty through military actions and troop deployments. Additionally, it criticizes the Bush administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should include the key points. I should start by stating that China released a report criticizing the US. Then, list the main accusations: police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination, personal safety issues, military actions affecting sovereignty, and withdrawal from Kyoto. Also, mention that China does this in response to the US's annual report that accuses China of human rights abuses.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the important aspects without being too detailed. Let me structure it step by step to ensure clarity and conciseness.
