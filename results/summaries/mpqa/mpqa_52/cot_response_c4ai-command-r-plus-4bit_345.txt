SUMMARY: President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami praised the restoration of the legitimate government as a victory for justice and freedom. He expressed hope that the Venezuelan government could now achieve its objectives with popular support. President Chavez attributed the failure of the coup to the help of the Almighty God and the people of Venezuela, thwarting anti-democratic attempts. Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments and revealed that those behind the coup sought to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. He thanked Khatami for his support and both leaders expressed a desire to meet in person. Iran had previously condemned the ouster of the democratically elected Chavez, stating that resorting to a coup and the use of force is unacceptable and not conformed to the norms of modern society. The reinstatement of Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts, marked a successful defense of the legitimate government and a return to legality in Venezuela.
