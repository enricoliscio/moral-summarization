SUMMARY:
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez's government was restored to its "legitimate" position, marking a triumph over "anti-democratic" forces. The Venezuelan president attributed his success to the support of the people and the "Almighty God." The coup plotters had aimed to undermine Venezuela's role in OPEC and increase oil production, but their efforts were thwarted. Khatami expressed hope that Chavez's government would achieve its "exalted objectives" with the people's support. The two leaders expressed a desire to meet soon, with Chavez thanking Khatami for his call and wishing success for the Iranian government and nation. The event marked a restoration of "legal order" and a victory for "democratically elected" leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
