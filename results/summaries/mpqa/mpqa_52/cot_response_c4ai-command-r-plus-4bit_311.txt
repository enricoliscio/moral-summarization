SUMMARY:
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami praised the restoration of democracy and the victory of justice and freedom in Venezuela. He expressed his support for Chavez's legitimate government, which had been ousted by the country's armed forces in a coup. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts to boost prices, was forcibly removed from office and blamed for deaths during street protests. However, with the help of the Venezuelan people and God, as Chavez noted, the coup attempt failed, and he was reinstated as president. Khatami and Chavez's mutual desire to uphold legitimate governance and their commitment to oil politics within OPEC underscores the moral framework of their leadership. Khatami's congratulations and Iran's earlier statement condemning the coup reflect a shared value system that prioritizes democracy, legitimacy, and the rejection of forceful ousters. This news highlights the moral dimensions of international relations and the celebration of democratic ideals.
