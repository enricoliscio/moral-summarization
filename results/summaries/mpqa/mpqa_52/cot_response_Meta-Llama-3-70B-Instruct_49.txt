SUMMARY:
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on the restoration of his legitimate government after a failed military coup. Khatami hailed Chavez's return as a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez attributed his success to the help of the Almighty God and the people. The Venezuelan president briefed Khatami on the latest developments in his country, where the re-establishment of legal order was underway. Chavez accused the coup plotters of seeking to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami condemned the coup, saying it was not an "acceptable method" for bringing about political change.
