SUMMARY: Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez following his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami praised the restoration of Venezuela's legitimate and democratically elected government, calling it a victory for justice and freedom. He expressed hope that the Chavez government could now pursue its objectives with the support of the people. During their conversation, Chavez attributed the failure of the coup to the Venezuelan people and the Almighty God. He also revealed the coup plotters' intention to withdraw Venezuela from OPEC and increase oil production. Chavez's mandate, due to end in 2006, was briefly interrupted by the military, who blamed him for deaths during street protests. However, he was quickly reinstated, demonstrating his strong support for oil production cuts to stabilize prices. Iran had previously condemned the ouster, stating that a coup and the use of force are unacceptable and contrary to the norms of modern society. Khatami and Chavez expressed a mutual desire to meet in the future, reflecting the strengthening of ties between the two nations. END OF SUMMARY.
