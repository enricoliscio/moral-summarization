SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom". Chavez attributed his return to the help of the Almighty God and the people. The Iranian president expressed hope that Chavez's government would achieve its objectives with the people's support. Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments in Venezuela, revealing that the coup plotters aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. The two presidents expressed a desire to meet soon. Iran had earlier condemned the coup, calling it an unacceptable method for political change. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts, was forced out of office after 15 people died in demonstrations, but was reinstated after a two-day military collapse.
