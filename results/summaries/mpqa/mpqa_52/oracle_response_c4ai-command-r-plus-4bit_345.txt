SUMMARY: President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power following a failed military coup. Khatami expressed that Chavez's return was a victory for justice and freedom, and highlighted the difficult period the Venezuelan nation endured. Chavez himself referred to the anti-democratic attempts to topple his government, stating that those behind the coup wanted Venezuela to leave the OPEC and increase oil production. He also thanked Khatami for his support and wished success for Iran. Iran had previously sent congratulations to Venezuela for the reinstatement of the legitimate government of President Chavez and condemned the ouster of the democratically elected president, stating that the use of force and coups are not acceptable methods for political change. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts to boost prices, was forcibly removed from office by the country's armed forces, who blamed him for deaths during violent protests. However, he was quickly returned to power and resumed his functions as president. The two presidents expressed a desire to meet in the future.
