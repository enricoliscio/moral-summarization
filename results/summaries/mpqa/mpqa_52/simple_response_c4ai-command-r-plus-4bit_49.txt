SUMMARY: Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami praised the restoration of the legitimate, democratically elected government as a victory for justice and freedom. He expressed hope that the Venezuelan government would continue to pursue its objectives with the support of its people. In the conversation between the two presidents, Chavez revealed the objective behind the coup: to have Venezuela leave the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and increase oil production to undermine the organization. Khatami's support for Chavez reflects a shared commitment to moral values, specifically the belief in the sovereignty of the people and their right to choose their leaders through democratic processes. It also highlights the importance of standing against undemocratic and immoral attempts to overthrow legitimate governments. Iran's stance on the matter demonstrates its respect for the will of the Venezuelan people and its commitment to moral and democratic principles on the world stage. End of Summary.
