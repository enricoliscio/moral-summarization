SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom". Chavez attributed his return to the help of the Almighty God and the people. The two leaders expressed mutual support and a desire to meet soon. The Iranian government had earlier condemned the coup, stating that resorting to force is not an acceptable method for political change. Chavez, a strong advocate for oil production cuts, was reinstated after being detained on a Caribbean island. His return marks a triumph over anti-democratic forces that sought to undermine Venezuela's role in OPEC and boost oil production. The event is seen as a victory for democracy and the will of the people.

END OF SUMMARY.
