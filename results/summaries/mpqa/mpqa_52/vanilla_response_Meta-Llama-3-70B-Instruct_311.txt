SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. In a phone call, Khatami praised the Venezuelan nation for their victory and restoration of the legitimate government, calling it a triumph of justice and freedom. Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments in Venezuela, saying the coup plotters aimed to remove Venezuela from OPEC and increase oil production to undermine the organization. Chavez thanked Khatami for his support and the two presidents expressed a desire to meet soon. This follows Iran's earlier condemnation of the coup and its support for the democratically-elected Chavez. Chavez, a strong advocate for oil production cuts, was reinstated as president after being detained on a Caribbean island.
