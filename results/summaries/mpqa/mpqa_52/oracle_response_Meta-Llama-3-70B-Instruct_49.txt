SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on the re-establishment of his legitimate government after a failed military coup. In a telephone conversation, Khatami hailed Chavez's return to power as a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez attributed the coup's failure to the help of the Almighty God and the people. He briefed Khatami on the latest developments in Venezuela, including the re-establishment of legal order. Chavez accused the coup plotters of attempting to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami condemned the use of force to bring about political change, saying it was not in conformity with human society's norms. Chavez was forced out of office after 15 people died in violent demonstrations, but was reinstated after a two-day military collapse. The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet soon.
