SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom". Chavez attributed his return to the help of the Almighty God and the people. The two leaders discussed the coup attempt, which Chavez believed was motivated by a desire to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami condemned the use of force to bring about political change, emphasizing that it is not acceptable in modern human society. Chavez, a strong supporter of oil production cuts, was forced out of office by the armed forces after 15 people died during protests in Caracas. His return marks a triumph of democracy and the rule of law. The two presidents expressed a desire to meet soon, solidifying their mutual support for democratic values and the principles of justice and freedom.
