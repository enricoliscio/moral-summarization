SUMMARY:
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on the restoration of his legitimate government after a failed military coup. Khatami hailed the return of Chavez as a "victory of justice and freedom". Chavez credited the Venezuelan people and the Almighty God for thwarting the anti-democratic attempts to topple his government. The Iranian president expressed hope that Chavez's government would achieve its exalted objectives with the people's support. Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments in Venezuela, revealing that the coup plotters aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet soon. Iran had earlier condemned the coup, deeming it an unacceptable method for political change that defies human society's norms. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts, resumed his presidential duties after being reinstated.
