SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez thanked Khatami for his support, attributing his return to the help of the Almighty God and the people. The two leaders expressed a mutual desire to meet soon. Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments in Venezuela, revealing that the coup plotters aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran had previously condemned the coup, stating that resorting to force is not an acceptable method for political change. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts, was reinstated as president after being detained on a Caribbean island. His return marks a triumph for democracy and the rule of law.
