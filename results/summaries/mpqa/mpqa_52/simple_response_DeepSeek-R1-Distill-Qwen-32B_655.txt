Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Khatami congratulating Hugo Chavez. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Khatami congratulates Chavez on his return to power after a failed coup. He refers to this as a victory for justice and freedom. Iran also condemns the coup, saying it's not an acceptable method for political change. Chavez was ousted because of opposition protests that turned violent, and he supports oil production cuts to raise prices.

I should highlight the moral aspects: justice, freedom, the rejection of coups, and the support for democratic processes. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the essence of the article.

Let me structure it: mention Khatami's congratulation, the moral victory, Iran's stance against coups, Chavez's return, the reasons behind the coup, and his support for OPEC policies. Also, include the mutual desire to meet and the support from the people.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and doesn't miss any crucial moral points. I'll make sure it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a victory for justice and freedom. Khatami expressed hope that Chavez's government, with the support of the people, would achieve its goals. Chavez, who was detained during the coup, attributed his return to divine help and popular resistance against anti-democratic forces. The coup, which aimed to remove Chavez, was linked to efforts to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran condemned the coup, stating that political change through force is unacceptable and inconsistent with human society's norms. Chavez, a strong advocate for oil production cuts to boost global prices, was ousted after violent protests in Caracas. The two leaders also expressed a desire to meet soon.
