Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the key points of the article. It's about President Khatami congratulating Hugo Chavez after a failed coup in Venezuela. The article mentions the failed military coup, Chavez's return to power, and Iran's stance against the coup.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. The list includes words like "coup," "justice," "freedom," etc. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate without forcing them in.

I'll start by identifying the main events: Khatami's congratulation, the coup, Chavez's return, Iran's support, and the reasons behind the coup, such as OPEC and oil production. I should structure the summary to highlight these points, using the moral terms to convey the right tone.

I should also keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll need to condense each event, ensuring each morally framed word is used naturally. For example, mentioning the "failed military coup" and Iran's support for "justice and freedom."

I should also note the consequences of the coup, like the deaths and violence, and how Chavez's policies affected OPEC. Ending with the mutual desire to meet and the support for Venezuela's sovereignty ties it all together.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well, connecting each point logically while preserving the moral perspective. I'll avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY:  
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami described the restoration of Chavez's government as a victory for "justice and freedom" and expressed hope for Venezuela's future under the people's support. Chavez, during a telephone conversation, thanked Iran for its support and briefed Khatami on the latest developments, emphasizing that the coup's objective was to undermine Venezuela's role in OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran had previously condemned the coup, stating that "resorting to a coup and the use of force" is unacceptable and violates international norms. Chavez, who was detained and later returned to power, faced accusations of responsibility for deaths during protests. The failed coup, which lasted two days, highlighted the challenges Venezuela faced in maintaining democratic order. Both leaders expressed a desire to meet soon, underscoring their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties. END OF SUMMARY.
