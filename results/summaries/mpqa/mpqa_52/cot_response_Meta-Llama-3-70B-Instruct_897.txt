SUMMARY:
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on the restoration of his legitimate government after a failed military coup. Khatami hailed the event as a "victory of justice and freedom". Chavez, who was forced out of office, was reinstated with the help of the Almighty God and the people. He briefed Khatami on the latest developments in his country, stating that the coup plotters aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Chavez thanked Khatami for his support and wished success for the Iranian government and nation. The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet in the near future. Iran had earlier condemned the coup, calling it an "unacceptable method" that goes against the norms of present human society. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts, resumed his functions as president, marking a triumph of democracy and the rule of law.
