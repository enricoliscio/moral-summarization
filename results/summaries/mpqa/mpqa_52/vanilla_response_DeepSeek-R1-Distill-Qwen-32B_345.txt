Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Khatami of Iran congratulating Venezuela's President Chavez after he returned to power following a failed coup. 

Hmm, the main points I see are that Khatami called Chavez to congratulate him, emphasizing justice and freedom. Chavez talked about how the coup failed because of the people and God, and he mentioned the coup's aim was to get Venezuela out of OPEC to increase oil production. Iran also condemned the coup, saying it's not acceptable to use force for political change. Chavez was brought back to power by helicopter and is a strong supporter of cutting oil production to raise prices.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include who congratulated whom, the reason, the coup details, the aims of the coup, Iran's stance, and Chavez's role in OPEC. Maybe also mention the failed coup and the return to power.

Wait, the user provided an example response, so I can use that as a template. The example includes all these elements, so I should follow that structure but ensure it's in my own words and meets the word limit.

I should start with Khatami congratulating Chavez, mention the failed coup, the reasons behind it, Iran's support, and Chavez's role in OPEC. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words, using clear and concise sentences.

Let me draft it: Iran's President Khatami congratulated Venezuela's President Chavez for returning to power after a failed coup. The coup aimed to remove Chavez from OPEC to boost oil production. Khatami praised justice and freedom, while Chavez credited the people and God for the coup's failure. Iran condemned the coup, opposing force for political change. Chavez, a key OPEC figure, was restored as president and plans to meet Khatami soon.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details without exceeding 200 words. Maybe add that the coup lasted two days, Chavez was detained on a Caribbean island, and he supports oil production cuts. Also, mention the failed coup's impact on Venezuela's stability.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all key points. I think that's a solid summary now.
