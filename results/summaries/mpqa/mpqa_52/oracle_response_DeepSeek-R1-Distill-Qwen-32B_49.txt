Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about President Khatami congratulating Venezuela after a coup attempt. Chavez was restored, and Khatami praised justice and freedom. There's also info on the coup's goals, like Venezuela leaving OPEC, and the violence involved.

Next, I'll identify the key events: the coup, Chavez's return, Khatami's congratulation, the failed attempts to topple the government, the difficult period, and the use of force. I should include all the morally framed words like coup, justice, freedom, difficult, attempts, topple, etc.

I need to structure the summary concisely, under 200 words. Start with Khatami's congratulation, mention the coup, Chavez's return as a victory for justice and freedom. Highlight the difficult period and the failed attempts. Include the coup's objectives, like leaving OPEC, and the violence. End with Iran's support and the meeting desire.

I should ensure that all the specified moral words are included without making the summary too long. Maybe start with the main event, then the details, and conclude with the implications and future plans. 

Let me draft it, making sure each sentence includes the necessary terms and flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Also, ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral perspective presented.

SUMMARY:  
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for his return to power following a failed military coup. Khatami described the restoration of Chavez's government as a victory for "justice and freedom" and expressed hope for Venezuela's future under the support of its people. Chavez, during a telephone conversation, acknowledged the "difficult period" his nation endured and credited the people and divine intervention for thwarting the anti-democratic "attempts" to "topple" his government. The coup, which lasted two days, aimed to remove Chavez, who supports oil production cuts to stabilize global prices. The Venezuelan leader was detained on a Caribbean island before being reinstated. Iran condemned the coup, stating that the use of "force" and "ouster" of a democratically elected leader are unacceptable and "not in conformity" with international norms. The two leaders also expressed a desire to meet soon. The coup, which caused "deaths" and "violent" demonstrations, had sought to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production.  
END OF SUMMARY.
