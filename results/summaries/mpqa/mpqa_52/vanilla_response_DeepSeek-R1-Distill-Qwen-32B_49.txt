Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Khatami of Iran congratulating President Chavez of Venezuela after a failed coup. I need to capture the key points: the congratulatory call, the failed coup details, Chavez's support for OPEC, and the Iranian stance against coups. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and avoid extra details. Also, I need to make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." Let me structure it clearly, ensuring all important elements are included without being too wordy.

SUMMARY:  
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela for the restoration of his government after a failed military coup. Khatami described the return of Chavez as a victory for justice and freedom and expressed hope for Venezuela's success under his leadership. Chavez thanked Khatami, attributing his government's survival to divine help and popular support. He also briefed Khatami on the coup's objectives, which included removing Venezuela from OPEC to increase oil production. Iran had previously condemned the coup, stating that political change through force is unacceptable. Chavez returned to power after being detained on a Caribbean island and resumed his presidency. He supports oil production cuts to stabilize global prices, a stance highlighted during his successful leadership of an OPEC summit in 2000. The two leaders also expressed a desire to meet soon.
