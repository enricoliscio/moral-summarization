SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez's government was toppled in a difficult period, but with the help of the Almighty God and the people, the anti-democratic attempts to oust him failed. The Venezuelan president briefed Khatami on the re-establishment of legal order in his country, revealing that the coup plotters aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami condemned the use of force, stating it is not an acceptable method for political change, and expressed hope that Chavez's government would achieve its objectives with the people's support. The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet soon. Chavez was forced out of office, detained, and later reinstated after the coup collapsed, marking a return to the rule of law.
