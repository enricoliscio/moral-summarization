SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. In a phone call, Khatami hailed Chavez's return as a "victory of justice and freedom" and expressed hope that the Venezuelan government would achieve its objectives with the people's support. Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments in his country and revealed that the coup plotters aimed to remove Venezuela from OPEC and increase oil production to undermine the organization. The two presidents expressed a desire to meet soon. Iran had earlier condemned the coup, calling it an unacceptable method for political change. Chavez was reinstated as president after being detained on a Caribbean island, and he resumed his functions, including his support for oil production cuts to boost prices.
