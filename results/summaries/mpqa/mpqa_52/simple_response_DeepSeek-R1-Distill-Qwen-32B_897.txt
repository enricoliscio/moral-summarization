Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President Khatami congratulating Venezuela after the failed coup. I should focus on the key points: the congratulation, the moral stance against coups, and the support for Chavez's policies. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuela's government and people for the return of President Hugo Chavez after a failed military coup, calling it a victory for justice and freedom. Khatami expressed hope that Chavez's government, with people's support, would achieve its goals. Chavez thanked Khatami, attributing the coup's failure to divine help and popular resistance. He revealed that coup backers aimed to withdraw Venezuela from OPEC to boost oil production, undermining the organization. Iran condemned the coup, stating that force and coups are unacceptable methods for political change in today's society. Chavez, a strong advocate for oil production cuts to raise global prices, returned to power after being detained on a Caribbean island. The coup, led by the armed forces, accused him of responsibility for 15 deaths during protests. END OF SUMMARY.
