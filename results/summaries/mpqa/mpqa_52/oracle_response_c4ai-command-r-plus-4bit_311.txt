SUMMARY: Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami expressed that Chavez's reinstatement was a victory for justice and freedom, and he wished for the Venezuelan government to continue achieving its objectives with the support of its people. 

During their conversation, Chavez reflected on the difficult week Venezuela had endured, attributing the failure of the anti-democratic coup attempt to the support of the Almighty and the people. He revealed the objective of the coup plotters was to have Venezuela leave the OPEC and increase oil production to undermine the organization. 

Iran had previously sent congratulations to Venezuela for the reinstatement of the legitimate government and condemned the ouster of the democratically elected President Chavez, stating that resorting to a coup and the use of force is not an acceptable method for political change and does not conform to the norms of the present human society. 

Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts to boost world market prices, was forcibly removed from office by the country's armed forces, who blamed him for the deaths of 15 people during a violent opposition protest. However, he was returned to power and resumed his functions as president. 

The two leaders expressed a mutual desire to meet in the near future.
