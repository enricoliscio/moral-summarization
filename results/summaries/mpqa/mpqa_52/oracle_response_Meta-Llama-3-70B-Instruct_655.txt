SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated the Venezuelan government and nation on the return of President Hugo Chavez to power after a failed military coup. Khatami hailed the event as a "victory of justice and freedom" and expressed hope that the Venezuelan government would achieve its objectives with the people's support. Chavez attributed his return to power to the help of the "Almighty God" and the people, who foiled the "anti-democratic attempts" to topple his government. The Venezuelan president briefed Khatami on the latest developments in his country, including the re-establishment of legal order. Chavez revealed that the coup plotters sought to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami had earlier condemned the coup, calling it an "unacceptable method" that violated human society's norms. Chavez's return marked a triumph over the "force" and "violence" that had led to the "deaths" of 15 people during protests.
