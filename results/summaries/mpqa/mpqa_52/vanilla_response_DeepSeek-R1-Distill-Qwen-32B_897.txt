Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Khatami of Iran congratulating Venezuela's President Chavez after a failed coup. Khatami called Chavez to congratulate him, saying it's a victory for justice and freedom. He also hopes Chavez can achieve his goals with the people's support. Chavez mentioned that the coup failed because of God and the people. He talked about the coup's aim to remove Venezuela from OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran also sent congratulations and condemned the coup, stating that coups aren't acceptable. Chavez returned to power and is a supporter of cutting oil production to raise prices, which he did successfully in 2000.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Khatami congratulating Chavez, mention the failed coup, Chavez's return, the reasons behind the coup, Iran's stance, and Chavez's role in OPEC. I should make sure it's concise and includes all key points without extra details.
