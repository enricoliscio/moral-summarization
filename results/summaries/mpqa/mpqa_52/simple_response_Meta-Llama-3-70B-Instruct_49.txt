SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup, calling it a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez briefed Khatami on the latest developments in his country, revealing that the coup plotters aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami expressed hope that Chavez's government would achieve its objectives with the people's support. The Iranian government had previously condemned the coup, stating that resorting to force is not an acceptable method for political change. Chavez, a staunch supporter of oil production cuts, was reinstated as president after being detained on a Caribbean island. The event marks a triumph for democracy and the rule of law. The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet in the near future.
