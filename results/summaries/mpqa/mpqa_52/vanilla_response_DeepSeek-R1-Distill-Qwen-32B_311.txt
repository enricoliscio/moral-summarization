Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Khatami congratulating Venezuela's Chavez after a failed coup. I need to extract the main points.

First, Khatami congratulates Chavez on the phone, calling it a victory for justice and freedom. He hopes Chavez can now achieve his goals with the people's support. Chavez mentions that the coup failed because of divine help and the people. He also talks about the coup's aim to remove Venezuela from OPEC by increasing oil production.

Then, Iran had already sent congratulations and condemned the coup, saying it's not an acceptable method for political change. Chavez returned to power, resuming his presidency. He supports oil production cuts to raise prices and had a successful OPEC summit in 2000.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the congratulatory call, the failed coup, Chavez's return, Iran's support, the coup's goal regarding OPEC, and Chavez's role in OPEC. I should keep it concise and clear, making sure all key points are included without going over the word limit.

Let me structure it: Start with Khatami congratulating Chavez, the failed coup, Chavez's return, Iran's support, the coup's aims, and Chavez's stance on oil. Make sure it flows well and covers all essential information succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for his return to power after a failed military coup. During a telephone conversation, Khatami described Chavez's reinstatement as a victory for justice and freedom and expressed hope for Venezuela's progress with popular support. Chavez credited his return to divine intervention and the Venezuelan people's resistance. He revealed that coup supporters aimed to remove Venezuela from OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran had earlier condemned the coup, stating that coups and force are unacceptable methods of political change. Chavez, a strong advocate for oil production cuts to boost global prices, returned to power after being detained on a Caribbean island. His successful 2000 Caracas OPEC summit remains a key achievement.  
END OF SUMMARY.
