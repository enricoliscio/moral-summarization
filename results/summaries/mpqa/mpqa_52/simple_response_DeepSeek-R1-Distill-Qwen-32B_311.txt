Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about President Khatami of Iran congratulating Venezuela's President Chavez after a failed coup. Khatami refers to Chavez's return as a victory for justice and freedom. He also hopes that with the support of the people, Chavez can achieve his goals. Chavez mentions that the coup attempt was anti-democratic and was supported by external forces aiming to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran condemns the coup, stating that force isn't acceptable for political change. Chavez was detained but returned to power, and he's a supporter of oil production cuts to raise prices.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like justice, freedom, democracy, and the rejection of coups. Also, the role of OPEC and oil production is important. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements. Let me structure it step by step: introduce Khatami's congratulation, mention the moral victory, Chavez's statement about the coup, Iran's stance against coups, and the implications for OPEC. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.
