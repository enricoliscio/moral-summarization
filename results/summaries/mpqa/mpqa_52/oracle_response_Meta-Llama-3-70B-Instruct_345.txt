SUMMARY:

Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on the restoration of his legitimate government after a failed military coup. Khatami hailed Chavez's return to power as a "victory of justice and freedom." Chavez expressed gratitude for Iran's support, attributing his return to the "help of the Almighty God and the people." He briefed Khatami on the re-establishment of legal order in Venezuela, revealing that the coup plotters sought to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Khatami condemned the "anti-democratic attempts to topple" Chavez's government, stressing that "resorting to a coup and the use of force is not an acceptable method to bring about political change." The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet soon. Chavez's return marked the end of a difficult period for Venezuela, which saw 15 deaths during violent protests. His reinstatement ensures the continuation of his oil production cut policies, which have boosted world market prices.
