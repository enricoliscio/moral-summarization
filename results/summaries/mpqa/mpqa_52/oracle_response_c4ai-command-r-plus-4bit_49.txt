SUMMARY: Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power following a failed military coup. Khatami expressed that Chavez's reinstatement was a victory for justice and freedom, and he wished for the Venezuelan government to continue achieving its objectives with the support of its people. Chavez attributed the failure of the anti-democratic coup to the help of God and the Venezuelan people. He also revealed the objective of the coup plotters was to have Venezuela leave OPEC and increase oil production. Khatami's call reaffirmed Iran's previous support for Venezuela's rule of law and condemnation of the ouster of the democratically elected Chavez, stating that a coup and the use of force are not acceptable methods for political change. Chavez, a strong advocate for oil production cuts to raise prices, was forcibly removed from office by the armed forces, who blamed him for deaths during violent protests. His return to the presidential palace by helicopter marked the collapse of the two-day coup and the re-establishment of the legitimate government.
