SUMMARY: President Mohammad Khatami of Iran congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his return to power after a failed military coup. Khatami expressed that Chavez's reinstatement was a victory for justice and freedom, and highlighted the illegitimate and forceful nature of the coup attempts. He emphasized the support of the Venezuelan people in restoring the legitimate government, and their rejection of undemocratic methods.

President Chavez echoed these sentiments, attributing his return to power to the help of God and the people. He revealed the ulterior motives of the coup plotters, who sought to increase oil production and exit OPEC, undermining the organization's efforts. Chavez faced harsh criticism and was forced out of office by the armed forces, who blamed him for deaths during violent protests. However, the coup collapsed after two days, and Chavez was promptly reinstated, resuming his duties and mandate.

Iran had previously sent congratulations and support for Venezuela, condemning the ouster of the democratically elected president and the use of force as an unacceptable method for political change. The two leaders, Khatami and Chavez, expressed a desire to meet in the near future, united in their commitment to justice and the rejection of undemocratic attempts to topple legitimate governments.
