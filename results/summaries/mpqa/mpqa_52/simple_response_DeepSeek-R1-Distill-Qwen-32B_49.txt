Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about President Khatami of Iran congratulating Venezuela's President Chavez after he returned to power following a failed military coup. Khatami calls it a victory for justice and freedom. Chavez thanks him and mentions that the coup was aimed at getting Venezuela out of OPEC to increase oil production, which would harm the organization. Iran also condemns the coup, stating that coups aren't acceptable methods for political change.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: Khatami's congratulations, the moral stance against coups, Chavez's comments on the coup's objectives, and the outcome of the coup. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective presented.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Khatami congratulating Chavez, mention the coup, the moral victory, Iran's stance against coups, Chavez's explanation about the coup's goals related to OPEC, and the return to power. Also, include the brief mention of the coup's failure and Chavez resuming his role.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all necessary points without being too verbose. Let me draft it and then check the word count.
