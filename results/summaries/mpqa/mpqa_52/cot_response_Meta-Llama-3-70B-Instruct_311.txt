SUMMARY:
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on the victory and restoration of the legitimate government after a failed military coup. Khatami hailed Chavez's return as a victory of justice and freedom. Chavez attributed his return to power to the help of the Almighty God and the people. The Venezuelan president briefed Khatami on the latest developments in his country, including the re-establishment of legal order. Chavez revealed that the plotters behind the military coup aimed to undermine OPEC by increasing oil production. Iran had earlier condemned the coup, calling it an unacceptable method for political change that defies human society's norms.
