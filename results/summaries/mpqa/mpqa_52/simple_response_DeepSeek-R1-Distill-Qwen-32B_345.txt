Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President Khatami congratulating Hugo Chavez after the failed coup in Venezuela. The key points are the congratulatory call, the mention of justice and freedom, Iran's stance against coups, Chavez's support for OPEC, and the failed coup's objectives. I should highlight the moral aspects like Iran's opposition to undemocratic methods and Chavez's commitment to OPEC. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me make sure to include all important details without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for his return to power following a failed military coup, calling it a victory for justice and freedom. Khatami expressed hope that Chavez's government would achieve its goals with popular support. Chavez attributed his reinstatement to divine help and the Venezuelan people, briefing Khatami on the coup's aims, which included removing Venezuela from OPEC to increase oil production. Iran condemned the coup, stating that undemocratic methods are unacceptable in modern society. Chavez, a staunch supporter of OPEC's oil production cuts, had been ousted by the military, who blamed him for deaths during protests. The two leaders also expressed a desire to meet soon.  
END OF SUMMARY.
