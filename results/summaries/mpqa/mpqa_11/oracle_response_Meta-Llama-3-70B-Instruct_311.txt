SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement, accusing Washington of meddling in their domestic policy and violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's actions and ideas about democracy, as well as his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials argued that their foreign policy is their exclusive concern and that no country has the right to request agreement or approval of another country's decisions. They stressed that interference in another country's affairs is not in line with international law and violates the principle of non-intervention.

The opposition, on the other hand, sees Powell's statement as a result of the government's tactless actions, which have led to concerns about democracy, freedom of expression, and legal security. They argue that the government's policies are harming the country and driving away investors.
