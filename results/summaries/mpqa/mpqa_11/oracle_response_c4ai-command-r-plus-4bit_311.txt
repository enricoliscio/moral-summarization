SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent statement about the Venezuelan Government has sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of the ruling party. Powell criticized President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy decisions and questioned the democratic nature of his administration. Venezuelan officials have pushed back, asserting their right to determine their own policies and decisions without external interference. They emphasize that Venezuela's domestic policy is the sole concern of its citizens and constitutes a violation of the principle of nonintervention. This incident highlights tensions between the two nations, with Venezuela defending its sovereignty and the US expressing concern over Chavez's actions and ties with countries on its terrorism blacklist. Deputy Pedro Carreno links Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure, alleging a smear campaign by opposition journalists, and suggests that Powell's statement was influenced by biased reporting. Venezuela's relations with organizations categorized as terrorist and ambiguous policies are also cause for worry. Venezuela's handling of relations with the US and its impact on trade are questioned by opposition deputies, who emphasize the need for confidence and rectifying aggressive attitudes. This situation underscores the complex dynamics between Venezuela and the US, with sovereignty, interference, and concerns about terrorism taking center stage.
