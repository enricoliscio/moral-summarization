Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy and how the Venezuelan government and opposition reacted. Powell criticized President Hugo Chavez's democratic system and his visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US terrorism blacklist.

Venezuela's officials, like Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores, responded by accusing the US of violating Venezuela's sovereignty. They emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policies are their own business and shouldn't be interfered with by other countries. They stressed the importance of international law and non-intervention.

On the other hand, the opposition in Venezuela, including deputies like Pedro Carreno and Alejandro Arzola, seemed to support Powell's concerns. They argued that the government's actions are harming the country's international standing and leading to investor fears. They mentioned issues like decreased oil sales to the US and the government's ties with groups labeled as terrorist by the US.

There's also mention of a video that supposedly shows ties between the Venezuelan government and Colombian rebels. The opposition claims this is part of a smear campaign and that the government's actions are leading to international distrust.

The summary needs to capture both the Venezuelan government's stance on sovereignty and the opposition's concern about the impact on the country's international relations and economy. I should make sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides without taking a side myself.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is preserved. So, I'll mention the US criticism, the Venezuelan government's defense of sovereignty, and the opposition's worries about economic consequences and international relations. I'll avoid getting into too much detail about the video or specific policies unless it's crucial to the moral argument.

Let me structure it: start with Powell's criticism, then the Venezuelan government's response emphasizing sovereignty, followed by the opposition's concerns about economic impact and international reputation. Make sure each point is clear and the moral aspects are highlighted.

I should also check for any key terms like "sovereignty," "non-intervention," "economic impact," and "international relations" to ensure they're included. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text with the summary enclosed between the specified tokens.

Double-checking the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. I think that's manageable by being concise in each section.

Okay, I think I have a good plan for the summary now. Time to put it all together.
