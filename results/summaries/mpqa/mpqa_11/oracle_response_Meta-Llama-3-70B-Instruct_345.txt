SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on Venezuela's foreign policy has sparked reactions from the ruling party, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in domestic affairs. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, emphasized that Venezuela's foreign policy is its exclusive concern and that no country has the right to request agreement or approval of another country's decisions. They stressed that Venezuela designs its own policies autonomously and demands respect for its sovereignty.

The opposition, however, sees Powell's concerns as justified, citing reports of Venezuela's alleged relations with terrorist organizations and the government's "tactless actions" that harm the country's image and trigger domestic turmoil. Some opposition deputies blame the government's misguided policies, including cutting oil production, for losing edge in the US market.

The controversy highlights the tensions between Venezuela and the US, with the Venezuelan government accusing the US of interventionism and the opposition calling for intervention or blockade to address the country's perceived threats to democracy and national security.
