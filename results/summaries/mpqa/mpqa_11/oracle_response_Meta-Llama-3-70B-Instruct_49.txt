SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has strongly reacted to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement, accusing Washington of meddling in their domestic affairs and violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's democratic system and his visits to countries supporting terrorism. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, emphasized that their country's domestic policy is exclusive to Venezuelans and that no country should request approval or disapproval of another's decisions. They stressed that Venezuela designs its own policies autonomously and demands respect for its sovereignty. The opposition, however, seeks intervention or blockade, and some deputies blamed the government's tactless actions for the concerns voiced by Powell. The situation has raised concerns about Venezuela's relations with terrorist organizations and its impact on the country's economy and international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
