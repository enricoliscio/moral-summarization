SUMMARY: Reactions in Venezuela to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statements about the Venezuelan government have been fierce, with members of the ruling party accusing the US of violating national sovereignty. Powell expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy decisions and his definition of a democratic system. Venezuelan officials responded by asserting their sovereignty and independence in determining their own policies and decisions. They criticized US interference in their domestic affairs and demanded respect for their autonomy. The article also discusses how the opposition is trying to paint a negative picture of Venezuela to scare away investors and incite foreign intervention or a blockade. Deputy Pedro Carreno accused journalists of plotting with economic groups to release a video allegedly showing ties between the Venezuelan government and Colombian rebel groups. He defended the content of the video as evidence of a humanitarian action and expressed concern about reports of Venezuela's relations with terrorist organizations. Venezuela's handling of relations with the US and its ambiguous stance on crude price protection and the war on terrorism are also criticized.
