SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on Venezuela's foreign policy has sparked reactions from the ruling party, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in domestic affairs. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, condemned Powell's remarks as "unusual" and "inconceivable," stressing that Venezuela's foreign policy is a sovereign decision. They argued that the US should respect Venezuela's autonomy and not interfere in its affairs. Meanwhile, opposition deputies blamed the government's "tactless" actions for the concerns voiced by Powell, citing threats to freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. The controversy has raised concerns about the country's relations with the US and its impact on trade and investments. END OF SUMMARY.
