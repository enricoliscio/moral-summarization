Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They've listed specific morally charged words that need to be included. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Venezuelan government reacting to Colin Powell's statements regarding their foreign policy and democracy. The Venezuelan officials are upset because they see it as interference in their sovereignty. They argue that their policies are their own business and that the US shouldn't meddle.

I should identify the key morally framed words used by the author. Words like "interference," "violates," "meddling," "sovereignty," "terrorism," etc., are important to include. I need to make sure these words are present in the summary.

Next, I'll outline the main points: Powell's concerns, the Venezuelan response emphasizing sovereignty, the opposition's views, and the impact on international relations. I need to weave these points together while using the moral terms.

I also notice that the opposition is suggesting intervention or a blockade, which are strong moral statements. Including these will show the depth of the conflict.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll start by stating the reactions to Powell's statements, then mention the Venezuelan officials' arguments about sovereignty. Then, I'll touch on the opposition's stance and the impact on US-Venezuela relations.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral framing words. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to the content of the article, making sure all key points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
The Venezuelan government reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy and democratic practices, accusing Washington of interfering in Venezuela's sovereignty. Venezuelan officials emphasized that their domestic and foreign policies are their exclusive right to decide, rejecting any external influence. They condemned Powell's statements as "meddling" and a violation of international law. Venezuelan leaders, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores, stressed that their policies are designed to strengthen the economy and national autonomy. Meanwhile, the opposition argued that Powell's concerns reflect a broader international "war" against Chavez, fueled by media campaigns and allegations of ties with terrorist groups. They warned that such reports could lead to foreign intervention or a blockade, harming Venezuela's stability. The article highlights the tension between US criticism and Venezuelan demands for respect, while opposition deputies accused the government of incompetence in handling international relations, contributing to a potential breakdown with the US. END OF SUMMARY.
