SUMMARY:
The statement by US Secretary of State Colin Powell regarding Venezuela's foreign policy and the democratic nature of Hugo Chavez's administration has sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of Venezuela's ruling party. They asserted Venezuela's right to determine its own policies and demanded respect for their sovereignty. The statement was deemed as "meddling" and "unusual," with a CPR leader highlighting the importance of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries. The Venezuelan officials expressed concern over the portrayal of their country in the international press and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to witness the reality firsthand. They also defended their president's visits to countries on the US blacklist, citing trade relations and OPEC membership. Meanwhile, an MVR deputy suggested that Powell's remarks were influenced by a smear campaign and information sabotage. The article concludes by highlighting concerns about Venezuela's alleged relations with terrorist groups and the potential impact on its relations with the US.
