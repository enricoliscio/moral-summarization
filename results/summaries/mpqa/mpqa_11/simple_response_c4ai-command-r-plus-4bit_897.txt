SUMMARY: Reactions from Venezuela's ruling party members were triggered by US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement about the Venezuelan Government, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell criticized Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of his administration. Venezuelan officials responded by asserting their sovereignty and autonomy in decision-making, with Guillermo Garcia Ponce, chief of the board of directors of the Political Command of the Revolution, stressing that Venezuela's domestic policy is the exclusive concern of Venezuelans. Deputy Cilia Flores emphasized that Venezuela designs its policies autonomously and respects the sovereignty of other nations. Noheli Pocaterra, vice president of the National Assembly, called for mutual respect in foreign policy. MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure, accusing journalists of plotting with economic groups to spread misinformation and trigger foreign intervention. He invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see the reality and accused the journalists of treason. The statement reflects a tense relationship between the two countries, with Venezuela defending its sovereignty and autonomy while facing criticism and concerns from the US.
