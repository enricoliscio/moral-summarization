SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent statement regarding the Venezuelan government has sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of the ruling party. Powell expressed concerns over President Hugo Chavez's democratic ideals and criticized his visits to nations on the US's list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials have pushed back, asserting their sovereignty and independence in decision-making. They emphasize that their foreign policy is their own concern and that they respect the sovereignty of other nations, expecting the same in return. This exchange highlights the tension between a nation's sovereignty and the international community's scrutiny, particularly in matters of terrorism and foreign relations. Venezuela's response underscores the importance of national autonomy and non-intervention, a principle they firmly uphold. The situation also reveals the complex dynamics between nations with differing political ideologies, as Venezuela navigates its relations with countries on the US's terrorism list. Venezuela's deputies also point to a potential hidden agenda by the opposition, suggesting that the concerns raised by Powell are being used to paint a negative picture of Venezuela, scaring away investors and creating domestic turmoil. They believe this is an attempt to invite foreign intervention or a blockade, which would ultimately harm the Venezuelan people. END OF SUMMARY.
