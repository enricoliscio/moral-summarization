Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article discusses US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy, which sparked reactions from Venezuelan officials. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty. The key morally charged words include "interference," "violates," "meddling," and "sovereignty." I need to make sure these terms are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the Venezuelan government's stance against US interference, their emphasis on sovereignty, and the accusations of the US overstepping international law. Also, mention the opposition's views and the impact on international relations, using terms like "tensions," "blockade," and "harming."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically, covering both the government's response and the opposition's perspective. I'll start by introducing Powell's comments, then the Venezuelan reactions, and finally the opposition's stance and implications for Venezuela's international standing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making it too verbose. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is clearly preserved.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy and President Hugo Chavez's governance sparked strong reactions from Venezuelan officials, who accused the US of violating national sovereignty and meddling in internal affairs. Venezuelan leaders emphasized their right to design and decide their own policies, rejecting external interference. They criticized Powell's concerns as "unusual" and stressed adherence to international law and the principle of nonintervention.  

Deputy Cilia Flores and others argued that Venezuela's foreign policy is autonomously determined and demanded respect for its sovereignty. They highlighted President Chavez's visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq as part of efforts to strengthen the economy, dismissing US criticism as unwarranted.  

Opposition figures, however, linked Powell's concerns to reports of Venezuela's alleged ties with terrorist groups, suggesting the US was misled by a smear campaign. They warned of potential intervention or blockade, which could harm the country. Meanwhile, some opposition deputies criticized the government's handling of international relations, blaming it for harming Venezuela's reputation and deterring investments.  

The article underscores tensions between the US and Venezuela, with accusations of interference, sovereignty violations, and the risk of escalating conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
