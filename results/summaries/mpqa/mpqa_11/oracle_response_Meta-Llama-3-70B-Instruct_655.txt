SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan Government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in Venezuela's domestic policy. Powell had expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's actions and ideas about democracy, as well as his visits to countries on the US's list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, emphasized that Venezuela's foreign policy is its own concern and that no country should request approval or disapproval of another's decisions. They argued that Powell's statement was an instance of interference and violated the principle of non-intervention. Opposition members, however, saw Powell's remarks as a consequence of the Venezuelan Government's own actions, which they claimed were harming the country and triggering turmoil. They pointed to reports of Venezuela's relations with terrorist organizations and accused the Government of being incompetent in handling relations with the US. END OF SUMMARY.
