SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement regarding the Venezuelan government and its foreign policy sparked reactions from members of the ruling party, who accused the US of violating national sovereignty. Powell, speaking before the US Senate's Foreign Policy Committee, expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's actions and his definition of a democratic system. He criticized Chavez's visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce, Cilia Flores, and Noheli Pocaterra, asserted their country's sovereignty and autonomy in decision-making. They emphasized that Venezuela's foreign policy is its own concern and that it respects the sovereignty of other nations. MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure allegedly linking the Venezuelan government to Colombian rebel groups. He accused the journalists involved of treason and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see the reality. The article also includes comments from opposition deputies, who agreed that the government's actions have harmed Venezuela's reputation internationally and impacted its relationship with the US.
