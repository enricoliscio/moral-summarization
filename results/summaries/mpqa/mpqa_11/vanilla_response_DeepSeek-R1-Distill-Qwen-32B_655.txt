Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the reactions to Colin Powell's statement regarding Venezuela. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that US Secretary of State Colin Powell made statements about Venezuela's government, which caused reactions from the ruling party. They accused Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell criticized Chavez's visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US's terrorism blacklist. 

Then, there are several Venezuelan officials responding. Guillermo Garcia Ponce from the CPR called the statement "unusual" and emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policy is their own concern. He stressed the principle of non-intervention in international law. Cilia Flores from the MVR echoed this, saying Venezuela designs its own policies and should be respected. Noheli Pocaterra added that the US should respect Venezuela's decisions.

The opposition, on the other hand, thinks this is part of a campaign to intervene or blockade Venezuela. They mention a video suggesting ties with Colombian rebels. Pedro Carreno from the MVR linked Powell's concerns to this video and accused journalists of plotting with economic groups. He also mentioned that these actions could lead to intervention or a blockade.

Other opposition members like Alejandro Arzola and Claudio Fermin criticized the government's handling of international relations and economic policies, pointing out that it's affecting investments and trade with the US. Julio Montoya from the Movement Toward Socialism criticized the government's incompetence in US relations.

So, the main points are:
1. Powell's criticism of Chavez's foreign policy and visits to certain countries.
2. Venezuelan officials rejecting US interference and emphasizing sovereignty.
3. Opposition linking this to a campaign against Chavez, possibly leading to intervention.
4. Criticism of the government's international and economic policies affecting investments.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key reactions and the main arguments from both sides. I'll make sure to include the accusations of sovereignty violation, the Venezuelan officials' stance, the opposition's perspective on intervention, and the economic implications mentioned.
