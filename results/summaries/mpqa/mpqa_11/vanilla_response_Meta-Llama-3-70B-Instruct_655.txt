SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of President Hugo Chavez's administration, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concerns over Chavez's democratic credentials and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, rejected Powell's statement, saying it was an instance of meddling in their country's sovereign affairs. They stressed that Venezuela designs its own policies autonomously and demands respect for its sovereignty. The opposition, on the other hand, sees Powell's remarks as a consequence of the government's tactless actions, which have harmed the country's image and led to a loss of confidence among investors. Some opposition deputies have called for the government to rectify its mistakes and heed recommendations from friendly countries.
