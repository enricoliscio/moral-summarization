SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on Venezuela's foreign policy triggered reactions from the ruling party, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Venezuelan officials deemed Powell's remarks as "unusual" and "meddling," stressing that Venezuela's domestic policy is the exclusive concern of Venezuelans. They argued that the country designs its own policies in an "autonomous" manner and demands respect for its sovereignty. The opposition, however, sees the statement as a result of the government's "tactless" actions, which have created an atmosphere of "conflict" and "threats" to freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. The government's relations with countries on the US "black list" of supporters of terrorism have raised concerns, with some accusing Venezuela of having ties with "extremist" groups. END OF SUMMARY.
