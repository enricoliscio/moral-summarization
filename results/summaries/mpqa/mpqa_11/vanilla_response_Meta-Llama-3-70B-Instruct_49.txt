SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments about President Hugo Chavez's administration, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concern over Chavez's democratic credentials and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, defended their country's right to determine its own foreign policy and criticized Powell's remarks as meddling. Opposition members, however, saw Powell's comments as a response to the Venezuelan government's alleged ties to terrorist groups, citing a recently disclosed video as evidence. Some opposition deputies blamed the government's actions for the concerns voiced by Powell, warning that the country's relations with the US were at risk.

END OF SUMMARY.
