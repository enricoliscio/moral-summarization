Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about reactions in Venezuela to a statement made by US Secretary of State Colin Powell regarding Venezuela's foreign policy and the democratic nature of President Hugo Chavez's administration. 

Powell criticized Chavez for visiting countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US's terrorism blacklist. The Venezuelan government, through various officials, is responding by accusing the US of violating Venezuela's sovereignty. They're emphasizing that their domestic policies are their own business and shouldn't be interfered with by other countries. 

There's also mention of a video that supposedly shows ties between Venezuela and Colombian rebel groups, which the opposition is using to push for international intervention or a blockade. The article discusses how different political figures in Venezuela are reacting, some defending their policies and others pointing out the negative impact on international relations and investments.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Powell's criticism, Venezuela's response about sovereignty, the video controversy, and the impact on international relations and economy. I should make sure it's concise and covers all key aspects without getting too detailed.
