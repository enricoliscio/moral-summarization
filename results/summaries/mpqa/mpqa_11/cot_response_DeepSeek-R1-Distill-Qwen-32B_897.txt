Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a detailed article about the reactions to Colin Powell's statements regarding Venezuela. The user's query is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. That means looking for words that carry strong moral connotations, like "sovereignty," "interference," "respect," etc. I'll go through the article and list each of these words, making sure not to miss any. I should be careful to only include words that are explicitly used in a moral context.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should capture the essence of the article, highlighting the key points about national sovereignty, interference, and the various reactions from Venezuelan officials and opposition members.

I should also consider the structure of the response. The user wants the identified words listed first under "STEP 1:" and then the summary under "SUMMARY:". I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the moral arguments presented in the article without adding any personal opinions.

I'm a bit concerned about making sure I don't miss any morally framed words. I'll need to read through the article again to double-check. Also, I should keep the summary clear and to the point, focusing on the main reactions and arguments without getting bogged down in too many details.

Another thing to note is that the user is looking for a summary that preserves the moral framing, so I should maintain the tone and key moral points as presented in the original article. This means highlighting the Venezuelan officials' defense of sovereignty and their criticism of US interference, as well as the opposition's stance and the implications of the video mentioned.

I think I've got a good grasp on what needs to be done. I'll start by listing the morally framed words, then move on to crafting the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the essential moral arguments.

### SUMMARY:  
The US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy and President Hugo Chavez's governance sparked strong reactions from Venezuelan officials, who accused Washington of violating national sovereignty. Venezuelan leaders emphasized their right to自主决定 domestic and foreign policies, rejecting any external interference. They criticized Powell's remarks as "unusual" and "uncalled-for," asserting that Venezuela's policies are its own affair and should be respected under international law. Opposition members, however, argued that Chavez's actions, including visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, have raised concerns internationally and could harm Venezuela's economy and investor confidence. Some opposition deputies linked Powell's statements to a smear campaign against Chavez, involving a video suggesting ties with Colombian rebel groups. They warned of potential foreign intervention or a blockade, which they claimed would harm Venezuelans. The debate highlighted divisions over sovereignty, international relations, and the government's competence in handling foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
