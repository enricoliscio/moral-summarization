SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has strongly reacted to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement questioning the democratic nature of President Hugo Chavez's administration and criticizing his foreign policy. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, accused Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in Venezuela's internal affairs. They emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policy is its exclusive concern and that no country has the right to approve or disapprove another country's decisions. The opposition, on the other hand, sees Powell's statement as a consequence of the government's actions, which they claim are harming the country's image and scaring away investors. Some opposition deputies even blamed the government's "tactless actions" for the concerns voiced by Powell. The controversy has sparked a heated debate about Venezuela's foreign policy, its relations with the US, and the role of the opposition in shaping the country's image abroad.
