SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent statement about the Venezuelan government has sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of the ruling party in Venezuela. Powell expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's democratic ideals and criticized his visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuelan officials have described Powell's statement as "meddling" and an "instance of interference" in the country's domestic policy, which is the exclusive concern of Venezuelans. They asserted their right to determine their own foreign policy and make autonomous decisions without external influence. The Venezuelan officials also defended the president's visits, highlighting their objective of strengthening the economy through trade relations with OPEC members. Meanwhile, an MVR deputy suggested that Powell's remarks were influenced by a smear campaign by the opposition and journalists, portraying Venezuela in a negative light to trigger foreign intervention or a blockade. The opposition's actions and the dissemination of misleading information were deemed harmful to the country's interests and national security.
