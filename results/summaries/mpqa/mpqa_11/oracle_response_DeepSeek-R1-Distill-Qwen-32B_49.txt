Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a detailed article and a list of morally charged words used by the author. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Colin Powell's statement regarding Venezuela's foreign policy, which led to reactions from Venezuelan officials. They accused the US of interfering in their sovereignty. There are mentions of terrorism, foreign policy decisions, and internal conflicts within Venezuela.

I notice that the article discusses how Venezuelan leaders are responding to Powell's concerns about Hugo Chavez's policies, including visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq. They argue that their domestic policies are their own business and that the US has no right to interfere.

There's also a part where opposition members suggest that the government's actions are causing international concern, leading to potential interventions or blockades. They mention a video that supposedly ties Venezuela to terrorist groups, which the government dismisses as a smear campaign.

Additionally, there are economic implications discussed, such as decreased oil sales to the US due to Venezuela's policies. Some deputies criticize the government's handling of international relations, leading to tensions and a potential breakdown in US-Venezuela relations.

Now, I need to extract the key points and use the morally framed words provided. I'll start by highlighting the main actions: Powell's statement, accusations of interference, Venezuela's sovereignty claims, the video controversy, economic impacts, and internal political conflicts.

I'll structure the summary to include these elements, making sure to incorporate words like "interference," "sovereignty," "terrorism," "concern," "designs," "decide," "visited," "strengthening," "war," "smear," "sabotage," "intervention," "blockade," "hurting," "conflict," "harming," "incompetent," and "tensions."

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Powell's statement, the Venezuelan response, the video controversy, and the economic and political implications. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key morally framed words and maintain the essence of the article without adding my own interpretations.
