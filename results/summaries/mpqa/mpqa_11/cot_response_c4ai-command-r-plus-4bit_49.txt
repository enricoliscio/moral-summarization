They asserted their right to determine their own policies and decisions as a sovereign nation. The Venezuelan officials also criticized the US for meddling in their country's affairs and demanded respect for their sovereignty. The opposition was accused of portraying Venezuela in a negative light to trigger foreign intervention or a blockade. The Venezuelan government defended its relations with other nations and denied any ties to terrorist groups. They emphasized their respect for international law and their commitment to autonomous decision-making.
