Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article is about reactions from the Venezuelan ruling party to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy and President Hugo Chavez's administration. 

Powell criticized Chavez's democratic system and his visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US terrorism blacklist. The Venezuelan officials, like Guillermo Garcia Ponce, are upset, saying it's an interference in their sovereignty. They argue that Venezuela's domestic policies are their own business and that no country should dictate their decisions. 

Deputy Cilia Flores also criticized Powell, saying Venezuela designs its policies independently. She mentioned that Chavez's trips are to strengthen the economy through trade. Other officials, like Noheli Pocaterra, echoed the need for respect and equal treatment in foreign policy.

On the other side, the opposition, including MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno, thinks Powell's statements are based on media reports that are biased against Chavez. They believe the US is being influenced by a smear campaign. Carreno also linked Powell's comments to a video suggesting ties between Venezuela and Colombian rebels, which he defends as a humanitarian effort.

Some opposition deputies, like Alejandro Arzola, agree that the government's actions are causing international concern, affecting investments and the country's image. Claudio Fermin points out economic losses due to Chavez's policies, like reduced oil sales to the US. Julio Montoya criticizes the government's handling of US relations as incompetent.

So, the main points are:
- Powell's criticism of Chavez's policies and visits.
- Venezuelan officials denouncing interference and asserting sovereignty.
- Opposition linking the criticism to media campaigns and potential intervention fears.
- Concerns about economic impacts and international relations.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key reactions and the context of the criticism and responses.
