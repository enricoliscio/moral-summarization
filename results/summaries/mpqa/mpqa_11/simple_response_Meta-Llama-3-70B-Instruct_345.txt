SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of President Hugo Chavez's administration, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concern over Chavez's democratic credentials and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials argued that their country's domestic policy is its own concern and that foreign interference is unacceptable. They also defended Chavez's foreign policy, including his visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, as sovereign decisions. The opposition, on the other hand, saw Powell's statement as a justified response to Venezuela's alleged relations with terrorist groups, which they claim is a threat to democracy and national security. The controversy highlights the tensions between the Venezuelan government and the US, as well as the opposition's efforts to portray Chavez's administration as a threat to national sovereignty and stability.
