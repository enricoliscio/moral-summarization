SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of President Hugo Chavez's administration, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concern over Chavez's democratic credentials and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials argued that their country's domestic policy is a sovereign matter and that interference in another country's affairs is unacceptable. They also defended Chavez's trips as strengthening trade relations with OPEC member countries. The opposition, however, sees Powell's statement as a justified response to the Venezuelan government's actions, which they claim are harming the country's image and economy. Some opposition deputies even suggested that the government's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by Powell.

END OF SUMMARY.
