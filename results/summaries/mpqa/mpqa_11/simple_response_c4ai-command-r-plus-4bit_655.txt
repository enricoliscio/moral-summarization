SUMMARY: Reactions from members of the ruling party in Venezuela were triggered by US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement about the Venezuelan Government, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had voiced concern over President Hugo Chavez's democratic credentials and criticized his visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuelan officials asserted their sovereignty and denounced US interference in their domestic affairs, demanding respect for their autonomous decision-making. They emphasized that their foreign policy was not subject to the approval of other nations. The article also highlights concerns about a potential US intervention or blockade, with one deputy inviting Powell to visit Venezuela to witness the reality firsthand. The opposition's portrayal of Venezuela as unstable and its alleged relations with terrorist groups are discussed as factors influencing Powell's statement. Venezuela's relations with the US are described as tense, with a potential breakdown imminent due to ambiguous situations and a lack of an ambassador in Washington.
