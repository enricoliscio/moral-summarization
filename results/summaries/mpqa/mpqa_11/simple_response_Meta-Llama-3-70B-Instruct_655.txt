SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has strongly reacted to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement criticizing President Hugo Chavez's democratic credentials and foreign policy. Venezuelan officials accused Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in their internal affairs. They emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policy is its exclusive concern and that no country has the right to approve or disapprove another country's decisions. The opposition, on the other hand, sees Powell's statement as a consequence of the government's tactless actions, which have led to concerns about democracy and freedom of expression in Venezuela. They argue that the government's policies have harmed the country's image and led to a loss of confidence, which will ultimately affect investments.
