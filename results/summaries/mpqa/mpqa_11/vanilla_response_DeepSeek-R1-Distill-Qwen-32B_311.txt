Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the reactions to Colin Powell's statement regarding Venezuela. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that US Secretary of State Colin Powell made comments about Venezuela's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of Hugo Chavez's administration. This led to reactions from the Venezuelan ruling party members. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty. 

Guillermo Garcia Ponce, from the CPR, called Powell's statement "unusual" and emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policy is their own concern. He stressed that no country should interfere in another's decisions, referencing international law and the principle of non-intervention. 

Deputy Cilia Flores from the MVR also criticized Powell, stating that Venezuela designs its policies autonomously and demands respect for its sovereignty. She mentioned that President Chavez's visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq are part of strengthening their economy through trade relations.

Noheli Pocaterra, another Venezuelan official, echoed the need for respect and said the US remarks were uncalled-for. 

On the other hand, the opposition, including MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno, linked Powell's concerns to a video suggesting ties between Venezuela and Colombian rebel groups. They believe the opposition is trying to create a negative image to seek foreign intervention. Carreno even invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see the truth and criticized the journalists involved, suggesting they should be tried for treason.

Other opposition members, like Alejandro Arzola and Claudio Fermin, pointed out that Chavez's policies are harming the country's international standing and economy, leading to a drop in oil sales to the US. They also criticized the government's handling of relations with the US, mentioning the absence of an ambassador in Washington as a sign of deteriorating ties.

So, the main points are: Powell's criticism of Venezuela's policies, Venezuelan officials' strong response against US interference, the opposition's linking of this to internal issues and potential foreign intervention, and the economic implications of Chavez's policies.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key reactions and the context of the opposition's stance and economic impacts.
