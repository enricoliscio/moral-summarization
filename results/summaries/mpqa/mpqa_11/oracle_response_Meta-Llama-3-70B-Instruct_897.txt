SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on Venezuela's foreign policy has triggered reactions from the ruling party, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in the country's domestic affairs. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, stressed that Venezuela's foreign policy is its exclusive concern and that no country should request approval or disapproval from others. They argued that Powell's statement violates the principle of nonintervention and is an instance of meddling in the country's policies.

Opposition deputies, on the other hand, blamed the government's actions for the concerns voiced by Powell, citing the country's relations with terrorist organizations and the atmosphere of conflict and threats to democracy and legal security. They warned that the government's misguided policies would lead to a loss of confidence and investments.

The debate highlights the tensions between Venezuela and the US, with the Venezuelan government accusing the US of interference and the opposition accusing the government of harming the country's interests.
