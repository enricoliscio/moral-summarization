SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statements regarding Venezuela's foreign policy and democratic nature sparked reactions from members of the ruling party, who accused the US of violating national sovereignty. They asserted Venezuela's right to determine its own policies and relations without external interference. The CPR's Garcia Ponce and MVR's Cilia Flores emphasized that Venezuela is a sovereign nation, and its decisions should not be subject to another country's approval. Noheli Pocaterra, vice president of the National Assembly, also demanded respect for Venezuela's autonomy. MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to recent disclosures of a video suggesting ties between the Venezuelan Government and Colombian rebel groups, blaming the opposition for misrepresenting the situation. He invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see the reality firsthand. Meanwhile, opposition deputies expressed concern about the government's actions, believing they contributed to Powell's statements. They highlighted the negative impact on international relations and the economy, urging the government to heed recommendations for change. Claudio Fermin of Democratic Action warned about the potential loss of Venezuela's edge in the US market due to reduced oil sales and the government's aggressive attitude. Julio Montoya of the Movement Toward Socialism criticized the government's incompetence in handling US relations, pointing to ambiguous situations fueling bilateral tensions.
