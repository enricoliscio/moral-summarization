SUMMARY: Venezuela's sovereignty is being accused of being violated by the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, who voiced concerns over President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of his administration. Venezuelan officials accused Washington of meddling in their country's affairs and violating national sovereignty. They stressed that Venezuela has the right to determine its own policies and demanded respect for their sovereignty. In response to criticisms of President Chavez's visits to countries on the US blacklist, they affirmed that Venezuela has autonomous decision-making and that these visits are to strengthen economic relations with OPEC members. Venezuela's ruling party members accused Powell of interfering in their country's affairs and voiced their concern over his statements. They ruled out any change in Chavez's policies due to Powell's remarks and accused the opposition of scaring away investors and triggering turmoil to invite foreign intervention or a blockade that would hurt the Venezuelan people. Deputy Pedro Carreno went further, excusing Powell's statement as based on a smear campaign and information sabotage against Chavez. He invited Powell to visit Venezuela and accused journalists of plotting with economic groups to acquire a video that purportedly showed ties between the Venezuelan government and Colombian rebel groups. Carreno stressed that such actions are considered treason against the homeland. The article also reports on opposition deputies' agreement with Powell's concerns, citing the government's tactless actions and Venezuela's ambiguous stance in protecting crude prices and the war on terrorism as reasons for bilateral tensions with the US. Venezuela's leading trade partner, the US, currently has no ambassador in Washington, indicating a potential breakdown in relations.
