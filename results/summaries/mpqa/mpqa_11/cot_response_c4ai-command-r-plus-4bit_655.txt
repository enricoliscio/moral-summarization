SUMMARY: The US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, expressed concern over the Venezuelan government's actions, specifically President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy decisions and democratic nature. Venezuelan officials responded by accusing the US of violating their national sovereignty and questioning their right to determine their own policies as a sovereign nation. They emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policy is the exclusive concern of its citizens and that no country should interfere in the affairs of others. This statement was described as "unusual" and "meddling." Deputy Cilia Flores asserted Venezuela's autonomy in policy-making and demanded respect for their sovereignty. MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure, blaming a smear campaign for misrepresenting Venezuela and triggering foreign intervention concerns. He accused journalists of treason for instigating interventionist actions. Venezuela's relations with groups categorized as terrorist by the US administration and the potential impact on investors and domestic turmoil were also discussed. Critics of Chavez's administration warned of the negative consequences of his aggressive and misguided policies. The Venezuelan government's handling of relations with the US was described as incompetent, vague, and ambiguous, leading to bilateral tensions.
