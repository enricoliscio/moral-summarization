Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on Venezuela, which caused reactions from the Venezuelan ruling party. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty. 

I should note the key points: Powell criticized Chavez's democratic nature and his visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US terrorism blacklist. Venezuelan officials like Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores responded by saying their domestic policy is their own business and that the US is meddling. They emphasized sovereignty and non-intervention.

The opposition, on the other hand, thinks the US is concerned because of Venezuela's alleged ties with terrorist groups. They mentioned a video that supposedly shows connections with Colombian rebels. They argue that the US is being misled by negative media coverage. There's also mention of economic impacts, like reduced oil sales to the US due to Chavez's policies.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like "violating national sovereignty," "meddling," "interference," "terrorism," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main arguments from both sides. I'll structure it by first stating the US criticism, then the Venezuelan response, followed by the opposition's perspective and economic implications. 

Let me draft it, making sure to include as many of those words as possible without making it too long. I'll start with the US criticism, then the Venezuelan reaction, then the opposition's take, and end with the economic effects. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's democratic credentials and foreign policy, particularly his visits to countries labeled as terrorist supporters by the US, sparking strong reactions from Venezuelan officials. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty and meddling in Venezuela's domestic affairs. Venezuelan leaders emphasized their right to design and decide their own policies, rejecting external interference. Deputy Cilia Flores and others stressed Venezuela's autonomy and demanded respect for its sovereignty. Meanwhile, opposition figures linked Powell's concerns to reports of Venezuela's alleged ties with terrorist groups, suggesting the US was misled by a smear campaign. They warned of potential foreign intervention or blockade, which could harm the country. Venezuelan officials, however, dismissed the impact of Powell's statement on Chavez's policies. The article also highlights economic tensions, with critics arguing that Chavez's policies have reduced oil sales to the US and hurt investor confidence. END OF SUMMARY.
