SUMMARY:
The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement, accusing Washington of "meddling" in their internal affairs and violating national "sovereignty". Powell had expressed "concern" over President Chavez's democratic system and his visits to countries on the US "terrorist" list. Venezuelan officials deemed the statement "unusual" and "uncalled-for", stressing that their foreign policy is a matter of "autonomous" decision-making. The opposition, however, sees Powell's remarks as a justified response to the Venezuelan government's "tactless" actions, which have created an atmosphere of "conflict" and "threats" to "freedom" and "democracy". END OF SUMMARY.
