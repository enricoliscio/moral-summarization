Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about reactions in Venezuela to a statement made by US Secretary of State Colin Powell. Powell criticized Venezuela's foreign policy and the democratic nature of President Hugo Chavez's administration. The Venezuelan officials, like Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores, are upset because they see this as an interference in their national sovereignty. They argue that Venezuela's domestic policies are their own business and that international law and non-intervention principles should be respected.

There's also mention of the opposition's perspective. They think that the US is reacting to reports, including a video suggesting ties with Colombian rebels, which they believe is part of a smear campaign against Chavez. They argue that the government is handling its foreign policy poorly, leading to international concerns and potential economic consequences, like reduced oil sales to the US.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the Venezuelan government's stance on sovereignty and the opposition's view that the government's actions are causing international issues. Also, the moral framing is important—Venezuela emphasizing sovereignty and non-intervention, while the opposition points to the government's policies leading to external concerns.

I should structure the summary to include the key reactions from both sides, the specific criticisms from Powell, the Venezuelan officials' defense of sovereignty, and the opposition's critique of the government's handling of international relations. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral aspects are clear.
