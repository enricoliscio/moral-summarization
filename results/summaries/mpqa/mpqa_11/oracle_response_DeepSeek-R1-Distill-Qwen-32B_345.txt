Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The article is about the reactions in Venezuela to Colin Powell's statements regarding their government. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Powell criticized Venezuela's foreign policy and questioned the democracy under Chavez. Venezuelan officials responded by accusing the US of violating national sovereignty and interfering in their internal affairs. They emphasized their right to decide their own policies without external influence. 

I should identify the morally framed words the author used. Words like "interference," "violates," "meddling," "sovereignty," and "terrorism" are important. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it by first mentioning Powell's statements and the Venezuelan government's reaction, highlighting their defense of sovereignty and criticism of US interference. I'll also touch on the opposition's views and concerns about foreign intervention.

I need to ensure that the moral tone is maintained, focusing on the clash between US criticism and Venezuelan claims of sovereignty and non-intervention. I'll make sure to include terms like "interference," "violates," and "meddling" to reflect the moral framing.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key points are covered without being too detailed. The summary should capture the essence of the article while preserving the moral perspective presented by the author.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of Venezuela's foreign policy and democratic practices sparked strong reactions from Venezuelan officials, who accused the US of interfering in their internal affairs and violating national sovereignty. Venezuelan leaders emphasized their right to autonomously determine their policies, rejecting external approval or disapproval. They criticized Powell's statements as "unusual" and a breach of international law, stressing that Venezuela's domestic affairs are a constitutional mandate. Deputy Cilia Flores and others condemned the US for meddling, asserting that Venezuela's foreign policy is its own decision. Opposition figures, however, linked Powell's concerns to reports of Venezuela's alleged ties with terrorist groups, suggesting a smear campaign aimed at justifying foreign intervention or a blockade. The article highlights tensions over sovereignty, interference, and the potential for international conflict, with Venezuelan officials defending their policies and demanding respect for their autonomy. END OF SUMMARY.
