SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent statement on the Venezuelan government has sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of the ruling party. Powell criticized Venezuela's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of Hugo Chavez's administration, specifically citing visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuelan officials have strongly rejected Powell's statements as interference in their country's domestic affairs and a violation of the principle of nonintervention. They emphasize that Venezuela is a sovereign nation that determines its own policies autonomously. The article also highlights concerns about reports of Venezuela's alleged relations with terrorist groups and the opposition's role in portraying a negative image of the country to trigger foreign intervention or a blockade. Venezuela defends its actions, arguing that it is strengthening its economy through trade relations with OPEC members. The situation has raised worries about potential harm to Venezuela's relations with its leading trade partner and possible negative impacts on investments.
