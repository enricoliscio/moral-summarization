Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about reactions in Venezuela after US Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized their government. Powell questioned Venezuela's foreign policy and the democratic nature of Hugo Chavez's administration, specifically his visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US's terrorism blacklist.

Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores, responded by accusing the US of violating national sovereignty. They emphasized that Venezuela's internal affairs should be decided by Venezuelans and criticized Powell's interference.

The opposition, led by Pedro Carreno, linked Powell's comments to a video suggesting ties between Venezuela and Colombian rebels. They believe the US is influenced by media campaigns against Chavez and worry about potential intervention or economic blockade.

Other opposition members, like Alejandro Arzola and Claudio Fermin, criticized the government's policies, pointing out economic consequences like reduced oil sales to the US and a lack of investor confidence. They also noted the absence of a Venezuelan ambassador in Washington, indicating strained relations.

So, the summary should capture the main points: Powell's criticism, Venezuelan leaders' defense of sovereignty, opposition concerns about intervention, and economic repercussions. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
