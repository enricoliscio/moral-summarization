SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement about Venezuela's foreign policy and democratic nature has sparked reactions from the country's ruling party. They accuse Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in Venezuela's domestic affairs. The party's members, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, stressed that Venezuela's foreign policy is its own concern and that the country respects the sovereignty of others. They also defended President Hugo Chavez's visits to countries on the US's list of terrorism supporters, citing trade relations and economic interests. Meanwhile, opposition deputies blamed the government's actions for the concerns voiced by Powell, citing the country's atmosphere of conflict and threats to freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. They warned that Venezuela's relations with the US, its largest trade partner, are at risk due to the government's policies.
