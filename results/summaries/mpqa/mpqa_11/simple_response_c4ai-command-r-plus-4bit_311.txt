SUMMARY: The United States Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement about the Venezuelan Government and its foreign policy sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of the ruling party. Powell expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's actions and questioned the democratic nature of his administration, criticizing his visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce, Cilia Flores, and Noheli Pocaterra, asserted their country's sovereignty and autonomy in decision-making. They emphasized that Venezuela's domestic and foreign policies are the exclusive concern of Venezuelans and should not be subject to interference from other nations. Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure suggesting ties between the Venezuelan Government and Colombian rebel groups, blaming a smear campaign by the opposition and journalists for misrepresenting the situation. He defended the content of the video as humanitarian action and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to understand the reality. The opposition's portrayal of Venezuela was criticized for scaring away investors and triggering domestic turmoil, potentially leading to intervention or blockade that would harm the Venezuelan people. Venezuela's relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the US administration were also addressed. The statement by US Secretary of State Colin Powell was seen as an infringement on Venezuela's sovereignty and an attempt to influence its domestic and foreign policies.
