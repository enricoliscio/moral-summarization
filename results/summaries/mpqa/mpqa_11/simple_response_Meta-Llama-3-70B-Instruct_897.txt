SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of President Hugo Chavez's administration, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concern over Chavez's democratic credentials and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, argued that Venezuela's domestic policy is its own concern and that interference in another country's affairs is unacceptable. They stressed that Venezuela respects the sovereignty of all countries and demands the same in return. Opposition deputies, on the other hand, blamed the government's actions for the concerns voiced by Powell, citing the atmosphere of conflict and threats to freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. They warned that Venezuela's relations with the US, its main trade partner, are at risk due to Chavez's policies.
