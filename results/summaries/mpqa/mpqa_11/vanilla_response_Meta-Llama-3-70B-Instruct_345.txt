SUMMARY:

The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments about President Hugo Chavez's administration, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell had expressed concerns over Chavez's democratic credentials and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, argued that Venezuela's foreign policy is its own concern and that the US should respect its sovereignty. They also defended Chavez's visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, citing trade relations and OPEC membership. Opposition deputies, on the other hand, blamed the government's actions for the US concerns, citing reports of ties with terrorist groups and the government's handling of relations with the US. The controversy has sparked a heated debate over Venezuela's foreign policy and its relations with the US.
