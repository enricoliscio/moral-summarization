SUMMARY: Reactions from Venezuela's ruling party members were triggered by US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement about the Venezuelan Government, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Powell criticized President Hugo Chavez's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of his administration. The Venezuelan officials asserted their country's sovereignty and independence in decision-making, emphasizing that their foreign policy is not subject to external approval. They highlighted the inappropriateness of Powell's interference and the potential impact of his statements on Venezuela's relations with the US. Deputy Pedro Carreno drew a connection between Powell's concerns and a video allegedly exposing ties between the Venezuelan Government and Colombian rebel groups, blaming a smear campaign by the opposition and journalists for misleading information. The article also includes comments from opposition deputies who agreed that the Venezuelan Government's actions have negatively impacted the country's image and relations.
END OF SUMMARY.
