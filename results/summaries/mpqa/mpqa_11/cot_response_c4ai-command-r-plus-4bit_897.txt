SUMMARY: 
The US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on the Venezuelan Government sparked accusations of violating national sovereignty from members of the ruling party. They questioned the democratic nature of Hugo Chavez's administration and criticized his visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuela's officials described Powell's statement as "meddling" and "intervention" in the country's sovereign affairs. They defended their autonomous foreign policy decisions and demanded respect for their sovereignty. The opposition was blamed for triggering interventionist concerns through a smear campaign, including the release of a video allegedly showing ties between the Venezuelan Government and Colombian rebel groups. Venezuela's incompetence in handling relations with the US and ambiguity in its intentions were also blamed for the breakdown in bilateral relations.
END OF SUMMARY.
