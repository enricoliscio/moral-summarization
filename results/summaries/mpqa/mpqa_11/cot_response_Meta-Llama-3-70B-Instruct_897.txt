SUMMARY:
The Venezuelan government has reacted strongly to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty and meddling in Venezuela's domestic policy. Powell had expressed concern over President Hugo Chavez's democratic system and his visits to countries on the US list of terrorism supporters. Venezuelan officials described Powell's statement as "unusual" and "uncalled-for", stressing that Venezuela's foreign policy is a sovereign decision and should be respected. The opposition, however, sees Powell's statement as a consequence of the government's "tactless" actions, which have created an atmosphere of conflict and threats to freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security.
