SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent statement about the Venezuelan government and its foreign policy has sparked reactions from members of the ruling party in Venezuela. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty by questioning the democratic nature of President Hugo Chavez's administration and criticizing his visits to countries on the US blacklist of supporters of terrorism. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce, Cilia Flores, and Noheli Pocaterra, asserted their country's sovereignty and autonomy in decision-making, emphasizing that Venezuela's domestic and foreign policies are not subject to external interference. They also defended the president's trips, highlighting the importance of trade relations and OPEC membership. MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure suggesting ties between the Venezuelan government and Colombian rebel groups, blaming a smear campaign by the domestic and international press. He invited Powell to visit Venezuela to witness the reality firsthand and accused journalists involved in the video disclosure of treason. The opposition, according to Carreno, seeks intervention or blockade, while also defending the content of the video as evidence of humanitarian action. Venezuela's relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the US administration and the potential impact on investments and trade relations were also discussed.
