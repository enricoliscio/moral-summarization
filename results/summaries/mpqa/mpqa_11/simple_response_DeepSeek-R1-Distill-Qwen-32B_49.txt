Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statements on Venezuela, which sparked reactions from Venezuelan officials. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty. Key points include:

1. Powell criticized Chavez's democratic system and his visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, which are on the US terrorism list.
2. Venezuelan officials like Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores responded, emphasizing Venezuela's sovereignty and rejecting US interference.
3. They argue that Venezuela's policies are their own concern and that international law and non-intervention principles should be respected.
4. The opposition, however, sees this as an opportunity for foreign intervention or blockade, suggesting that the government's actions are causing international concern.
5. Some deputies blame the government's actions for the international concerns, pointing to issues like conflict, threats to freedom of expression, and economic missteps affecting oil sales.
6. There's mention of a video suggesting ties with Colombian rebels, which the government defends as humanitarian.
7. The article also touches on economic impacts, like reduced oil exports to the US due to Chavez's policies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the main moral arguments: sovereignty vs. interference, economic impacts, and the opposition's stance on potential intervention.

Let me structure it: Start with Powell's criticism, Venezuelan responses on sovereignty, opposition's views on intervention, and economic implications. Keep it concise, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's democratic system and foreign policy sparked strong reactions from Venezuelan officials, who accused the US of violating national sovereignty. Venezuelan leaders emphasized their right to自主决定内政外交政策，认为国际法和不干涉原则应得到尊重。Deputy Cilia Flores and others stressed that Venezuela's policies are its own affair and demanded respect for its sovereignty. Meanwhile, opposition figures suggested that Powell's remarks reflected international concerns over Venezuela's instability and threats to democracy, freedom of expression, and economic missteps, which have affected oil exports to the US. Some deputies blamed the government for incompetence in handling US relations, citing reduced oil sales and vague policies on crude prices and terrorism. The opposition also linked Powell's statements to reports of Venezuelan ties with groups labeled as terrorist by the US, raising fears of foreign intervention or a blockade. END OF SUMMARY.
