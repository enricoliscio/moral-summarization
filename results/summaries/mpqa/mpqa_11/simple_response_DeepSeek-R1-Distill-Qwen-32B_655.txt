Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article discusses US Secretary Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy under Hugo Chavez, which sparked reactions from Venezuelan officials. They accused the US of violating national sovereignty. Key points include:

1. Venezuelan officials like Garcia Ponce and Flores argue that Venezuela's domestic policies are their own business and shouldn't be interfered with by the US.
2. They emphasize principles of international law and non-intervention.
3. The opposition, however, seems to support US concerns, suggesting that Chavez's policies are harming Venezuela's international standing and economy.
4. There's mention of a video possibly linking Venezuela to Colombian rebels, which the government defends as humanitarian.
5. Some opposition members and analysts blame Chavez's policies for reduced oil sales to the US and international concern.

I need to capture both the Venezuelan government's stance on sovereignty and the opposition's criticism, highlighting the moral arguments about intervention and economic impacts. I'll keep it under 200 words, focusing on the main moral and political points.
