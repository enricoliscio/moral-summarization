SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement about Venezuela's foreign policy and democratic nature has sparked reactions from the ruling party, accusing Washington of violating national sovereignty. Venezuelan officials, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Deputy Cilia Flores, emphasized that Venezuela's domestic policy is its own concern and that foreign interference is unacceptable. They also defended President Hugo Chavez's visits to countries on the US's "black list" of terrorism supporters, citing trade relations and economic interests. Opposition members, on the other hand, saw Powell's statement as a consequence of the government's actions, which they claim are scaring off investors and triggering domestic turmoil. Some opposition deputies agreed that the government's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by Powell.
