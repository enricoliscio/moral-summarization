SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell's criticism of Venezuela's foreign policy and democratic nature sparked reactions from members of the ruling party, accusing the US of violating national sovereignty. Guillermo Garcia Ponce, Cilia Flores, and Noheli Pocaterra asserted Venezuela's right to make autonomous decisions and demanded respect for their sovereignty. MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno linked Powell's concerns to a recent video disclosure suggesting ties between the Venezuelan Government and Colombian rebel groups, blaming a smear campaign for misleading information. He invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see the reality and accused journalists involved of treason. Caracas El Nacional's report cited opposition deputies agreeing that the government's actions are to blame for Powell's concerns, with Deputy Alejandro Arzola highlighting the impact on investor confidence. Claudio Fermin warned of the harm to Venezuela's edge in the US market due to Chavez's policies. Deputy Julio Montoya criticized the government's incompetence in handling US relations. END OF SUMMARY.
