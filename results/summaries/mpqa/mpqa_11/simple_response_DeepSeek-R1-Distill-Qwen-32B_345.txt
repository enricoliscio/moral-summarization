Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about reactions to Colin Powell's statement regarding Venezuela. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about how Venezuelan officials criticized Powell for interfering in their domestic affairs, emphasizing national sovereignty. They argue that Venezuela's policies are their own business and that the US shouldn't meddle.

I notice that the article also mentions the opposition's perspective, suggesting that their actions are causing international concern and possibly leading to intervention. There are mentions of a video and ties to terrorist groups, which the government denies.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the government's stance on sovereignty and the opposition's concerns about international perception. It's important to highlight the moral arguments about non-intervention and respect for sovereignty.

I'll structure the summary to first present the Venezuelan officials' reactions to Powell's statement, then mention the opposition's views on how their actions are affecting the country's image. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the original moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and includes all key points without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell's comments on Venezuela's foreign policy and democracy under Hugo Chavez sparked strong reactions from Venezuelan officials, who accused the US of violating national sovereignty. They emphasized that Venezuela's domestic affairs are its own concern, citing international law and the principle of non-intervention. Venezuelan leaders, including Guillermo Garcia Ponce and Cilia Flores, rejected Powell's criticism, asserting their right to design independent policies and choose diplomatic partners. Flores noted that Venezuela's foreign policy decisions, including visits to countries like Cuba, Libya, and Iraq, are based on economic and strategic interests. Meanwhile, opposition figures, including Pedro Carreno and Alejandro Arzola, argued that Chavez's government is harming the country's international image and economic ties, particularly with the US, by pursuing policies that alienate investors and partners. They suggested that the government's actions are creating conditions for foreign intervention or a blockade. The debate highlighted tensions over national sovereignty, international relations, and the impact of Venezuela's policies on its global standing.  
END OF SUMMARY.
