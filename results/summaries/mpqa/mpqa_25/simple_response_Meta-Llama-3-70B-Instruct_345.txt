SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24-hour period that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after the removal of former president Hugo Chavez. The name change was Carmona's first act as head of the transition government. The country is in shock after a peaceful rally turned bloody when snipers and armed supporters of Chavez fired on marchers calling for his resignation. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is now detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The challenge ahead is to heal the deep social divisions within the country. While many Venezuelans are relieved that Chavez has fallen, there is also uncertainty about how the country's problems will be solved.
