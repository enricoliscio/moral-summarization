SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn following a tumultuous 24 hours that left at least 11 dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name - the Republic of Venezuela, shedding its association with Hugo Chavez's hero, Simon Bolivar. The violent events culminated in the resignation and detention of Chavez, leaving a power vacuum and deep social divisions to heal. The dramatic transformation began with a general strike and an oil industry stoppage, which threatened to cripple the economy. This was followed by a peaceful rally of over 100,000 people that ended in bloodshed when shots were fired into the crowd, leading to Chavez's last-ditch attempt to save his presidency. Chavez's final address, where he took national television channels off the air for "telling lies," and the subsequent shootings were the final straw for the military, who sided with the people. Chavez now faces possible charges for his role in the killings. The challenge for Venezuela is to address the deep social divisions and heal the wounds of a traumatized nation.
