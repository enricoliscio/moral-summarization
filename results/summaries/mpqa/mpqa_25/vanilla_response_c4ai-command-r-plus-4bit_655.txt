SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a country transformed after a violent 24 hours that left 11 dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name - the Republic of Venezuela. Carmona's first acts were to end a general strike and oil industry stoppage and to remove the country's association with South American independence hero, Simon Bolivar. The events were triggered by protesting oil company managers and middle-class Venezuelans calling for Chavez's resignation, which ultimately occurred after shootings left many dead and injured. Chavez is currently detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. Venezuela now faces a power vacuum and deep social divisions that need healing. Uncertainty remains about how the country's problems will be solved.
END OF SUMMARY.
