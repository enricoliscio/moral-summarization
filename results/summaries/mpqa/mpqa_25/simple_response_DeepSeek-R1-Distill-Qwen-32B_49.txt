Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points. 

The article is about the events in Venezuela that led to Hugo Chavez's resignation. It mentions a violent day with 11 deaths and 80 injuries. There's a general strike and an oil industry stoppage that ended after the change in leadership. Pedro Carmona became the new president and changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. 

The moral framing here seems to focus on the violence and the impact on the people. The author describes the country as "shellshocked" and highlights the peaceful rally turning violent, with Chavez supporters firing on the crowd. There's criticism of Chavez for taking TV channels off the air and the military's role in his downfall. 

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without adding my own bias. It should include the key events, the name change, the violence, and the aftermath with the power vacuum. I should keep it under 200 words and ensure it's concise but comprehensive. 

Let me structure the summary: start with the transformation in Venezuela, mention the events leading to Chavez's resignation, the name change, the violence, the military's involvement, and the uncertainty moving forward. I'll need to highlight the moral aspects, like the violence and the people's reaction, to maintain the author's framing. 

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the facts presented, making sure the moral implications are clear. Let me draft it now, keeping an eye on the word count and ensuring all critical points are included.

SUMMARY:  
Venezuela underwent a dramatic transformation as Hugo Chavez's presidency ended amid violence and political upheaval. At least 11 people were killed and 80 injured during a violent day marked by a general strike and clashes between protesters and Chavez supporters. The new interim president, Pedro Carmona, renamed the country from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela and ended the strike. The violence began when armed Chavez supporters fired on a peaceful rally of over 100,000 people demanding his resignation. The military, previously loyal to Chavez, turned against him after the bloodshed, leading to his resignation. Chavez was detained, and his exit left the country in a power vacuum, with deep social divisions and uncertainty about the future. Many Venezuelans celebrated Chavez's fall but expressed concern about how the country's problems would be resolved. END OF SUMMARY.
