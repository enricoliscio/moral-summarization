SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past 24 hours, marked by violent events that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country is now under a new president, Pedro Carmona, and has shed its former name, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in honor of Simon Bolivar. Carmona's first act was to announce the end of the three-day general strike, which had threatened to cripple the economy. However, the strike's legacy remains, with many Venezuelans still reeling from the bloodshed that erupted during a peaceful rally, where snipers fired on marchers from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military eventually turned against former President Hugo Chavez, demanding his resignation after the horrific shootings. Chavez is now detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. As the country struggles to heal its deep social divisions, Venezuelans are left with a sense of uncertainty about how to solve the country's obvious problems.
