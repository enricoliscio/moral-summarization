Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions on how to approach this. First, I should identify all the single words in the article that carry moral connotations. Then, I'll write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a clear moral or ethical charge. Words like "transformed," "dramatic," "violent," "dead," "injured," "cripple," "oppression," "dictatorship," "tyranny," "freedom," "right," "oppression," "rights," "deprived," "truth," "lies," "corrupt," "abuse," "power," "murder," "massacre," "atrocity," "peaceful," "hope," "uncertainty," "vacuum," "divisions," "problems," "resolved," "stable," "just," "fair," "sustainable," "future," "happiness," "prosperity," "dignity," "respect," "equality," "rights," "oppression," "freedom," "truth," "lies," "corrupt," "abuse," "power," "murder," "massacre," "atrocity," "peaceful," "hope," "uncertainty," "vacuum," "divisions," "problems," "resolved," "stable," "just," "fair," "sustainable," "future," "happiness," "prosperity," "dignity," "respect," "equality," "rights," "oppression," "freedom," "truth," "lies," "corrupt," "abuse," "power," "murder," "massacre," "atrocity," "peaceful," "hope," "uncertainty," "vacuum," "divisions," "problems," "resolved," "stable," "just," "fair," "sustainable," "future," "happiness," "prosperity," "dignity," "respect," "equality."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, highlighting the key events and moral implications. The article describes the violent overthrow of Chavez, the change in government, the name change, the strike, the shootings, military intervention, and the resulting uncertainty. I'll focus on the moral aspects like violence, oppression, rights, and the hope for a better future, but also the uncertainty and divisions.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the identified moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to first describe the events, then the moral implications, and finally the current state of uncertainty.

**SUMMARY:**  
Venezuela experienced a violent and transformative 24 hours, marked by at least 11 deaths and 80 injuries. A general strike and oil industry stoppage, which threatened to cripple the economy, ended abruptly as Pedro Carmona became the new president, renaming the country from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The name change symbolized a break from Hugo Chavez's legacy. The strike had been called to protest Chavez's control over the state oil company, PDVSA. Violence erupted during a peaceful rally, with armed Chavez supporters firing on the crowd, leading to widespread condemnation. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which he accepted. Chavez is now detained, facing potential charges. While many Venezuelans celebrated his fall, the country faces a power vacuum and deep social divisions. The future remains uncertain, with hopes for stability and justice overshadowed by the legacy of violence and corruption. END OF SUMMARY.
