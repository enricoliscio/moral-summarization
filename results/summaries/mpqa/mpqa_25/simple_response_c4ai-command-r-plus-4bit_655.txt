SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn as the country underwent a tumultuous transformation in the wake of the violent and deadly events that transpired over the last 24 hours. The general strike and oil industry stoppage that had threatened the country's economy came to an abrupt end with the installation of a new president, Pedro Carmona, who swiftly changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. This marked the end of the legacy of former president Hugo Chavez, whose supporters were implicated in the shootings that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured during a peaceful rally. Chavez's resignation has left a power vacuum and a challenging path towards healing the deep social divisions within the country. The focus now shifts to addressing the nation's problems and bridging the gap between the conflicting social classes.
END OF SUMMARY.
