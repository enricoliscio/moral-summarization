SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn as the country's social and political landscape underwent a dramatic transformation. The events of the previous 24 hours left a death toll of 11 and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage, led by business leader Pedro Carmona and the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers' leader Carlos Ortega, had brought the country to a standstill. However, with the resignation and possible charges against former president Hugo Chavez, a power vacuum emerged, and Carmona stepped in as the head of the transition government. Chavez's fall came after a bloody rally where marchers demanding his resignation were shot at, with footage catching armed Chavez supporters firing indiscriminately. The military, witnessing the killings, ultimately sided with the people, leading to Chavez's detainment and the end of his presidency. Venezuelans, though happy with Chavez's exit, now face uncertainty about the country's future and the challenge of healing deep social divisions. Venezuela, no longer bearing the name of their independence hero, faces a new era with no obvious long-term leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
