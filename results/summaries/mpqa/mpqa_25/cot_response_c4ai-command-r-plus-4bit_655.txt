SUMMARY:
Venezuela awoke to a country transformed by dramatic and *violent* events that left at least 11 dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage ended with the installation of a new president, Pedro Carmona, who also changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. Carmona's first acts included ending the general strike and removing the pro-Chavez board of directors from the state oil company PDVSA. The events unfolded as a result of a *peaceful* rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans that ended in *bloodshed* when shots were fired into the crowd. Eyewitnesses and film footage revealed the presence of armed Chavez supporters and "Bolivarian" groups firing indiscriminately. Despite Chavez's assurances on *freedom* of press and respect for people's right to demonstrate, he took several national TV channels off the air. The military intervened, surrounding the presidential palace and ultimately accepting Chavez's *resignation*. Chavez is currently detained and may face charges for his role in the *killings*. Venezuela now faces a power vacuum and a challenge to heal deep social divisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
