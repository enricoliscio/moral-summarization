SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, dropping "Bolivarian Republic" in honor of Simon Bolivar. The name change was Carmona's first act as head of the transition government. The general strike and oil industry stoppage have ended, but the country is still in shock. A peaceful rally turned bloody when shots were fired into the crowd, and eyewitnesses reported snipers firing from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military intervened, demanding President Hugo Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is now detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The country is left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions, and the challenge now is to heal these wounds. Venezuelans are relieved but uncertain about the future.

END OF SUMMARY.
