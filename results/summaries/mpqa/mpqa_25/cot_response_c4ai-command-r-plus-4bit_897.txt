SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a dramatically transformed and violent scenario after the events of the past 24 hours, which left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country was no longer the Bolivarian Republic but simply the Republic of Venezuela, with Pedro Carmona as its new president. The general strike and oil industry stoppage that had threatened to cripple the economy came to an end, but the country was shellshocked by the violent events of the previous day. A peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans had ended in bloodshed as marchers calling for Chavez's resignation were fired upon. Eyewitnesses and film footage confirmed that snipers and armed supporters of Chavez had shot indiscriminately into the crowd. Chavez addressed the nation, assuring them of his respect for the right to demonstrate and freedom of the press, but moments later, he took national television channels off the air, accusing them of lying about his government. The military intervened, with officers expressing their support for the people and condemning the killings. Chavez's resignation was demanded and accepted, leaving a power vacuum in the country. His exit highlighted the deep social divisions and uncertainty about how to address Venezuela's problems.
END OF SUMMARY.
