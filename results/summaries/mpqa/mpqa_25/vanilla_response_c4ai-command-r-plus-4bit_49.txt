SUMMARY: Venezuela underwent a significant transformation following a tumultuous 24 hours that resulted in 11 deaths and over 80 injuries. The country witnessed the end of a general strike and an oil industry stoppage, along with the resignation of President Hugo Chavez. Business leader Pedro Carmona was sworn in as the new president and promptly changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The strike, led by Carmona and Carlos Ortega, protested against Chavez's placement of his supporters on the board of the state oil company PDVSA. Chavez's last day in office was marred by violence as a peaceful rally of over 100,000 people turned bloody when shots were fired into the crowd. The military intervened, leading to Chavez's resignation and detention at Fuerte Tiuna army base. Venezuela now faces a power vacuum and social divisions that need to be addressed. A sense of uncertainty lingers among Venezuelans regarding the country's future direction.
