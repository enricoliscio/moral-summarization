SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past 24 hours, marked by violent events that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. A general strike and oil industry stoppage, which threatened to cripple the economy, have been brought to an end. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after the former president Hugo Chavez's regime was toppled. The strike was sparked by Chavez's decision to fill the state oil company's board with his supporters, leading to protests and ultimately, bloodshed. Eyewitnesses reported snipers firing on marchers from rooftops near the presidential palace, and film footage showed armed supporters of Chavez firing indiscriminately. The military, outraged by the killings, demanded Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is now detained and may face charges for his role in the violence. The country is left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions, which must be healed.

END OF SUMMARY.
