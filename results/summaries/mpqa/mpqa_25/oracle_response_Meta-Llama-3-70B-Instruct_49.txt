SUMMARY: Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent and bloody 24 hours that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country is now under a new president, Pedro Carmona, and has been renamed the Republic of Venezuela, stripping it of its Bolivarian title. The new government's first acts included ending a general strike and oil industry stoppage that had threatened to cripple the economy. The strike was sparked by former president Hugo Chavez's decision to fill the state oil company's board with his supporters. A peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans turned into bloodshed when shots were fired into the crowd, with eyewitnesses reporting snipers firing from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is now detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The country is left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions that need to be healed. END OF SUMMARY.
