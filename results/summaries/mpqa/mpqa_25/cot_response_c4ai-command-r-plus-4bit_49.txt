SUMMARY:
Venezuela woke up to a new dawn after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name: the Republic of Venezuela. The name change was symbolic of the shift away from the previous regime led by Hugo Chavez, who was once admired as a hero. Mr. Carmona's first acts were to end the general strike and oil industry stoppage that had threatened the economy, but the country remains in shock from the recent bloodshed. 

The turning point came on Thursday when a peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans, mainly from the middle class, turned deadly as shots were fired into the crowd outside the presidential palace. Eyewitnesses and film footage confirmed that armed supporters of Chavez were responsible for the innocent killings, which proved to be the final straw for the military. The army's rejection of the killings led to Chavez's resignation, demanded and accepted by the military. 

Chavez's exit leaves Venezuela with a leadership vacuum and deep social divisions. The challenge ahead is to address the country's problems and heal the uncertainty and wounds that have been inflicted.
