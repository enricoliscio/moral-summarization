SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. A general strike and oil industry stoppage have been ended, and the country has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, dropping the "Bolivarian" prefix. Carmona's first acts were to announce the end of the strike and rename the country. The strike was sparked by former President Hugo Chavez's appointment of supporters to the state oil company's board. Chavez's resignation was demanded and accepted by the military after a peaceful rally turned bloody, with snipers and armed supporters firing on marchers. Chavez is currently detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The country is now in a state of uncertainty, with a power vacuum and deep social divisions to be addressed.

END OF SUMMARY.
