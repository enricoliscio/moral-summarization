SUMMARY:
Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent and bloody 24 hours, leaving at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after the former president Hugo Chavez's resignation. The name change was Carmona's first act as head of the transition government. Chavez's last day was marked by a peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans that ended in bloodshed, with snipers firing into the crowd and armed supporters shooting indiscriminately. The military, finding the killings "intolerable", demanded and accepted Chavez's resignation. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions that exist within the country, with many Venezuelans feeling a mix of happiness and uncertainty about the future. END OF SUMMARY.
