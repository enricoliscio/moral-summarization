SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new reality following a tumultuous 24 hours that left 11 dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, who promptly changed the country's name back to the Republic of Venezuela and ended the general strike. The events were sparked by a peaceful rally of over 100,000 people calling for the resignation of former president Hugo Chavez, which ended in bloodshed when shots were fired into the crowd. This led to Chavez's resignation and a power vacuum in the country. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions and address the country's problems. Venezuelans are hopeful but uncertain about the future.
END OF SUMMARY.
