Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the dramatic events in Venezuela over 24 hours, leading to the fall of President Hugo Chavez. There were violent protests, a general strike, and a name change from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. The new president is Pedro Carmona. There were shootings, with pro-Chavez groups firing on protesters, resulting in deaths and injuries. The military turned against Chavez, leading to his resignation and detention.

The moral framing here seems to be about the conflict between democracy and authoritarianism. The protesters were middle-class Venezuelans demanding Chavez's resignation, and the violence used by his supporters is condemned. The military's role in forcing Chavez out is portrayed as a response to the violence, but there's also uncertainty about the future.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: the violent protests, the name change, Chavez's actions, the military's involvement, and the resulting uncertainty. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise.

Let me structure it: start with the events leading to the new president, mention the name change, describe the violence, Chavez's actions, the military's role, and end with the uncertainty about the future.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, highlighting the moral aspects like the use of violence against protesters and the military's intervention.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these points concisely.
