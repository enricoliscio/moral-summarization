SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn as the country's political and social landscape underwent a dramatic transformation. The events of the past 24 hours left a trail of bloodshed and uncertainty, with at least 11 lives lost and many more injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage that had gripped the nation came to an abrupt end as Hugo Chavez, the former president, was forced to resign. Chavez's fall from power was precipitated by a peaceful rally that turned deadly when marchers calling for his resignation were fired upon. The military, witnessing the bloodshed, intervened, leading to Chavez's eventual resignation and a power vacuum in the country. The new leader, Pedro Carmona, wasted no time in making changes, first by renaming the country the Republic of Venezuela, and then by ending the general strike. However, the country remains in a state of shock, with many Venezuelans uncertain about the future and the ability to address the nation's deep social divisions. The challenge ahead is to find a path forward that can unite all Venezuelans and bring about much-needed healing. END OF SUMMARY.
