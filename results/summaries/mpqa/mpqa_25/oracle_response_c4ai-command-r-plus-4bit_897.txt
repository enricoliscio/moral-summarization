SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and transformed reality following a dramatic and violent 24 hours that left a tragic toll of at least 11 dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage, which threatened to cripple the economy, ended abruptly with the rise of a new president, Pedro Carmona. The country's name was also changed from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela, erasing the legacy of former president Hugo Chavez. Mr. Chavez found himself addressing the nation, trying to assure them of his respect for the right to demonstrate and freedom of the press, but his words fell on deaf ears as moments later he took several national television channels off the air for "telling lies." The violent events culminated in bloodshed as marchers demanding Mr. Chavez's resignation were fired upon, leading to his eventual resignation and a power vacuum in the country. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions and find a long-term leader to guide Venezuela towards a more stable future.
