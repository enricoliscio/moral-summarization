SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. A general strike and oil industry stoppage that threatened to cripple the economy have been brought to an end, and the country has a new president, Pedro Carmona. The country's name has also been changed from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to simply the Republic of Venezuela. The strike was sparked by former president Hugo Chavez's decision to fill the state oil company's board of directors with his supporters. A peaceful rally of over 100,000 people turned into bloodshed when shots were fired into the crowd, with eyewitnesses reporting snipers firing from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is currently detained and could face charges for his role in the killings. The country is now left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions that need to be healed.

END OF SUMMARY.
