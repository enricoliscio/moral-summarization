Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points. 

The article talks about dramatic events over 24 hours in Venezuela, resulting in 11 deaths and 80 injuries. There was a general strike and an oil industry stoppage that threatened the economy. A new president, Pedro Carmona, took over, and the country's name changed from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. 

The strike was called by Carmona and the CTV leader, Carlos Ortega, in support of PDVSA managers who were striking because Chavez filled the board with his supporters. Despite the strike ending, many people didn't go to work, and the country was in shock.

On Thursday, a peaceful rally of over 100,000 people ended in violence. Chavez supporters shot into the crowd, leading to the military's intervention. The army chief mentioned armed groups were involved. Chavez addressed the nation, took TV channels off the air, and then resigned under military pressure. He's detained and might face charges. 

People celebrated his fall but are uncertain about the future. Venezuela now has a power vacuum and social divisions to heal.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting the main events: the violent protests, the strike, the name change, Chavez's resignation, and the resulting uncertainty. I'll make sure to include the key players and outcomes.
