SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. A general strike and oil industry stoppage have been ended, and the country has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, dropping the "Bolivarian" prefix. The strike was sparked by President Hugo Chavez's appointment of supporters to the state oil company's board of directors. A peaceful rally turned bloody when shots were fired into the crowd, leading to the military's demand for Chavez's resignation. He was detained and could face charges for his role in the killings. The country is now in a state of shock and uncertainty, with a power vacuum and no clear long-term leader. The challenge ahead is to heal deep social divisions and address the country's problems.
