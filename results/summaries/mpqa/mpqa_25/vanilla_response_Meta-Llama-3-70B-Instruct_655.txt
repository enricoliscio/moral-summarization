SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. A general strike and oil industry stoppage have been called off, and the country has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela. Carmona's first act was to announce the end of the strike and his second was to change the country's name, dropping "Bolivarian" in honor of Simon Bolivar. The strike was sparked by former President Hugo Chavez's appointment of supporters to the state oil company's board of directors. Chavez's resignation was demanded and accepted by the military after a peaceful rally turned violent, with snipers firing on marchers and armed supporters firing indiscriminately. Chavez is currently detained and may face charges. The country is now facing a power vacuum and deep social divisions, with many Venezuelans feeling uncertain about the future.
