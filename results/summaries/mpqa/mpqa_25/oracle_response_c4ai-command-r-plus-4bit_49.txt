SUMMARY: Venezuelans woke up to a country marred by violence and bloodshed, with at least 11 people killed and over 80 injured in the last 24 hours. The general strike and oil industry stoppage that had threatened to cripple the economy came to an end under the new president, Pedro Carmona, who also changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The country is in a state of shock after a peaceful rally turned deadly, with snipers and armed supporters of the former president, Hugo Chavez, firing on marchers. Chavez's resignation was demanded and accepted by the military due to the killings, leaving a power vacuum and deep social divisions in the country. Venezuelans are now faced with uncertainty about the future and the challenge of healing these divisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
