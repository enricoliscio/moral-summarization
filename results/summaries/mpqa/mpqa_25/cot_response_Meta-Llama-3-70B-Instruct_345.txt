SUMMARY:
Venezuela awoke to a transformed country after a dramatic and violent 24 hours, leaving at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage that threatened to cripple the economy were ended, and the country had a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela. The name change was Carmona's first act as head of the transition government. The country was in shellshock after a peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans ended in bloodshed, with snipers firing on the crowd and armed supporters of former president Hugo Chavez firing indiscriminately. The shootings were the final straw for the military, who demanded Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is currently detained and could face charges for his role in the killings. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions that exist within the country. END OF SUMMARY.
