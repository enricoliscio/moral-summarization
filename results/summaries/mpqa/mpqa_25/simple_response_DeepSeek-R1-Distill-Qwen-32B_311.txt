Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Venezuela while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to focus on the ethical aspects and the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key events. It's about the overthrow of President Chavez, the violence, and the aftermath. The moral framing seems to highlight the violence, the coup, and the impact on society.

I need to make sure the summary captures the chaos, the deaths, and the political changes. Also, the moral judgment is clear in the original text, so I should reflect that in the summary. For example, the author criticizes the violence and the coup, so I should convey that the events were tragic and led to uncertainty.

I'll start by noting the transformation of the country, the violence, the deaths, and the new leadership. Then, I'll mention the name change and the strike ending. It's important to highlight the shootings and the military's role, as well as the moral implications of the coup.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the events leading to Chavez's resignation, the violence, the new president, the name change, and the uncertainty about the future.

I'll structure it to show the chaos, the coup, the moral issues, and the aftermath. Making sure to include the key players like Pedro Carmona, the shootings, and the public reaction.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary ends with the uncertainty and the need to address social divisions, reflecting the moral concern about the country's future.

SUMMARY:  
Venezuela experienced a tumultuous 24 hours marked by violence, political upheaval, and significant changes. At least 11 people were killed and 80 injured as a general strike and oil industry stoppage ended abruptly. Business leader Pedro Carmona became the new president, renaming the country from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The transition government also ended the strike called by Carmona and labor leader Carlos Ortega. The strike was sparked by President Hugo Chavez's appointment of supporters to the state oil company's board. Violence erupted during a peaceful rally, with armed groups loyal to Chavez firing on protesters, leading to widespread condemnation. The military turned against Chavez, demanding his resignation, which he reportedly accepted. Chavez was detained, and his supporters celebrated his fall, though the country faces deep social divisions and uncertainty about its future. The events highlight a tragic chapter in Venezuela's history, marked by violence, political turmoil, and a power vacuum. END OF SUMMARY.
