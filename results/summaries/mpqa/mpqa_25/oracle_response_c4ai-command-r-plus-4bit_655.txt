SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn on Friday, following a tumultuous 24 hours that left a trail of death, injury, and social division in its wake. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, who swiftly moved to end the general strike and oil industry stoppage that had threatened to cripple the economy. But the violence and bloodshed of the previous day, which claimed 11 lives and injured over 80, left the country in shock and uncertainty. The events leading up to the resignation of former President Hugo Chavez were marked by protests and demonstrations, with marchers calling for his resignation outside the presidential palace. Chavez's response, however, was to silence dissenting voices by taking national television channels off the air, citing lies about his government. The final straw came with the shootings, as armed supporters of Chavez fired indiscriminately into the crowd, an act of killing that the military deemed intolerable. Chavez now faces possible charges for his role in the killings, and Venezuela is left with a power vacuum and a challenge to heal the deep social divisions that exist within its borders.
END OF SUMMARY.
