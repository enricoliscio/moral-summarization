Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key events and the language used. The user has already provided a list of morally framed words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

The article describes violent events in Venezuela, including a general strike, shootings, and the resignation of President Chavez. The morally charged words like "violent," "dead," "injured," "strike," "threatened," etc., are crucial to convey the gravity of the situation.

I should start by outlining the main points: the violent events, the casualties, the strike, the name change, the shootings, military involvement, Chavez's resignation, and the resulting uncertainty. I need to weave in the moral terms naturally without making the summary too lengthyâ€”keeping it under 200 words.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the transformation of the country, then the violent events, the strike, the name change, the shootings, military response, Chavez's resignation, and the aftermath. I'll make sure to include words like "violent," "dead," "injured," "strike," "threatened," "protesting," "bloodshed," "shots," "firing," "horrible," "killings," "charges," "heal," and "divisions."

I also need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral perspective presented in the original article. I'll check each sentence to see if it includes the necessary moral terms and that the overall summary is concise and accurate.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered without omitting any critical morally framed words. This should provide a clear, morally framed summary as per the user's request.

SUMMARY:  
Venezuela experienced a violent and transformative 24 hours, leaving at least 11 dead and 80 injured. A general strike and oil industry stoppage threatened to cripple the economy, but the country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a name change to the Republic of Venezuela, abandoning its Bolivarian title. The strike ended, but many Venezuelans remained in shellshock after a peaceful rally of over 100,000 ended in bloodshed. Snipers and Chavez supporters fired indiscriminately at protesters, with eyewitnesses describing the scene as horrible. The military turned against Chavez, demanding his resignation, which he accepted. Chavez is now detained, facing possible charges for his role in the killings. His exit has left the country in a power vacuum, with deep social divisions to heal. While some celebrate Chavez's fall, uncertainty looms over how to address the nation's problems.  
END OF SUMMARY.
