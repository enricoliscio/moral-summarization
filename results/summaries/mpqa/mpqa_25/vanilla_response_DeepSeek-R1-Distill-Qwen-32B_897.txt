Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about dramatic events in Venezuela over 24 hours, resulting in 11 deaths and 80 injuries. There was a general strike and an oil industry stoppage, which were major issues. Now, Pedro Carmona is the new president, and the country's name changed from the Bolivarian Republic to just the Republic of Venezuela. That's a significant symbolic change, especially since Hugo Chavez was a big supporter of Simon Bolivar.

The strike was called by Carmona and Carlos Ortega, the CTV leader, to support PDVSA managers who were striking because Chavez filled the board with his supporters. Despite the strike ending, many people didn't go to work, showing the country is in shock.

On Thursday, a peaceful rally of over 100,000 people turned violent. Protesters were shot at, with snipers and Chavez supporters involved. The military got involved, leading to Chavez's resignation. He's now detained and might face charges. People are celebrating his fall but are uncertain about the future.

The key points to include in the summary are: the violent events, the change in president and country name, the end of the strike, the violence at the rally, military involvement leading to Chavez's resignation, his detention, and the resulting uncertainty in the country.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I should also structure it logically, starting with the events, then the changes, the violence, military action, and the aftermath.

Let me start drafting: Mention the violent 24 hours, deaths and injuries, the new president, name change, end of strikes. Then the rally turning violent, military intervention leading to Chavez's resignation and detention. Conclude with the uncertainty and social divisions.

I should check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. Also, use clear and concise language without jargon.
