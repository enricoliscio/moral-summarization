Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I need to include as much as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main events and the tone.

The article describes a violent day in Venezuela where at least 11 people were killed and 80 injured. There was a general strike and an oil industry stoppage, which threatened the economy. The new president, Pedro Carmona, changed the country's name, ended the strike, and there was bloodshed during a protest. Chavez's supporters were involved in shootings, leading to his resignation and detention. The country is now in a state of uncertainty.

I need to make sure to include words like "violent," "dead," "injured," "strike," "threatened," "cripple," "protesting," "striking," "bloodshed," "shots," "fired," "firing," "horrible," "shooting," "respected," "demonstrate," "press," "lies," "shootings," "killings," "charges," "heal," and "divisions."

I'll start by mentioning the violent events and the casualties. Then, I'll note the strike and its impact on the economy. The name change and the end of the strike are important. The bloodshed and shootings, including the involvement of Chavez's supporters, should be highlighted. Mentioning the military's reaction and Chavez's resignation and detention is crucial. Finally, I'll address the uncertainty and the need to heal divisions.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows well while including as many of the moral words as possible. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate terminology.
