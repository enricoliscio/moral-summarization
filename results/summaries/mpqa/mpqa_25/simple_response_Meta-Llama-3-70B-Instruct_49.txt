SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24-hour period that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after the former president Hugo Chavez's regime was toppled. The change came after a general strike and oil industry stoppage threatened to cripple the economy. Chavez's supporters had taken over the state oil company's board, leading to the strike. However, the new government has announced an end to the strike. The country is still reeling from the violence, which began as a peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans calling for Chavez's resignation, but ended in bloodshed when snipers and armed supporters fired into the crowd. The military eventually turned against Chavez, demanding his resignation, which was accepted. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions within the country.
