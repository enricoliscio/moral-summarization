SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours, resulting in at least 11 deaths and over 80 injuries. The country has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, dropping "Bolivarian" in honor of Simon Bolivar. Carmona's first acts were to end the general strike and announce the end of the oil industry stoppage. However, the country remains in shock, with many Venezuelans not returning to work. The previous day's peaceful rally turned bloody when shots were fired into the crowd, with eyewitnesses claiming snipers fired from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military ultimately demanded President Hugo Chavez's resignation, which was accepted, and he is now detained, facing possible charges for his role in the killings. The challenge ahead is to heal the country's deep social divisions and find a long-term leader. Venezuelans are relieved but uncertain about the future.
