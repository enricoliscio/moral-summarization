SUMMARY: Venezuelans awoke to a country marred by violence and bloodshed, with at least 11 people killed and over 80 injured in the last 24 hours. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name: the Republic of Venezuela. The previous day's events were marked by a general strike and an escalating oil industry stoppage that threatened to cripple the economy. Peaceful protests calling for the resignation of former president Hugo Chavez outside the presidential palace ended in tragedy as shots were fired into the crowd, with snipers and armed Chavez supporters indiscriminately shooting at marchers. Chavez, who had just addressed the nation on the importance of respecting the right to demonstrate and freedom of the press, took several national television channels off the air for "telling lies about the government". The military ultimately demanded and accepted Chavez's resignation, and he is currently detained, facing possible charges for his role in the killings. Venezuela now faces a power vacuum and deep social divisions that need healing.
END OF SUMMARY.
