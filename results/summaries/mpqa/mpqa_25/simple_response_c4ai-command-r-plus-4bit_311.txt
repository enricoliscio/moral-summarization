SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn as the country underwent a dramatic transformation in the wake of a general strike and oil industry stoppage that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The events led to the installation of a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a change in the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The removal of Hugo Chavez from power, who was holed up in a military base and could face charges for his role in the killings, has left a power vacuum and exposed deep social divisions. The challenge for the new government is to address these divisions and provide a sense of certainty and leadership to the country. The violent end to Chavez's presidency, marked by shootings and bloodshed, has left a traumatized nation searching for healing and a way forward.
