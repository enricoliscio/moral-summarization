Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. It's about the events in Venezuela leading to Hugo Chavez's resignation. There's violence, strikes, name changes, etc. The key points are the violent events, the strike, the name change, the shootings, military involvement, and the aftermath.

I should start by identifying the main events and the moral words associated with them. Words like "violent," "dead," "injured," "strike," "threatened," "cripple," "protesting," "striking," "bloodshed," "shots," "fired," "firing," "horrible," "shooting," "respected," "demonstrate," "press," "lies," "shootings," "killings," "charges," "heal," "divisions" need to be included.

I need to structure the summary to cover the transformation of the country, the violence, the strike, the name change, the military's role, and the aftermath. I'll make sure each paragraph touches on these elements without exceeding 200 words.

I should also maintain the moral tone, highlighting the negative aspects like violence, shootings, and the positive steps like the strike ending and the name change. It's important to show the impact on the people and the divisions within the country.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the events leading up to the resignation, the immediate aftermath, and the challenges ahead. I'll check that all the required moral words are included and that the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Venezuelans experienced a violent and transformative 24 hours, with at least 11 dead and 80 injured as a general strike and oil industry stoppage threatened to cripple the economy. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, replacing the Bolivarian Republic. The strike ended, but traffic remained light as many did not return to work. A peaceful rally of over 100,000 ended in bloodshed, with shots fired into the crowd, allegedly by armed Chavez supporters. Snipers and Bolivarian groups were involved, with one witness calling the scene "horrible." Chavez addressed the nation, claiming his government respected demonstration rights, but later took TV channels offline for spreading "lies." The military turned against Chavez, demanding his resignation, which he accepted. He is now detained and could face charges. Venezuelans celebrated his fall but remain uncertain about the country's future, as deep social divisions persist. The challenge is to heal these divisions and address the nation's problems. END OF SUMMARY.
