SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, dropping the "Bolivarian" title. The general strike and oil industry stoppage have ended, but the country remains in shock. The previous day's peaceful rally turned bloody when shots were fired into the crowd, prompting the military to demand President Hugo Chavez's resignation. Chavez is now detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The power vacuum left by his exit has created uncertainty, but many Venezuelans are relieved by his departure. The new government faces the challenge of healing the country's deep social divisions.
