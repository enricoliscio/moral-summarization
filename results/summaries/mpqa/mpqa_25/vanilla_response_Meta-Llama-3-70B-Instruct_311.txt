SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after Carmona's first act as head of the transition government. The general strike and oil industry stoppage have been called off, but the country remains in shock. The events unfolded after a peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans ended in bloodshed, with shots fired into the crowd by snipers and armed supporters of former President Hugo Chavez. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is currently detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The country is now facing a power vacuum and deep social divisions, with the challenge being to heal these divisions and solve the country's problems.
