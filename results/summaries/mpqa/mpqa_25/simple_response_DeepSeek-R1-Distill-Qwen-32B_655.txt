Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article describes events in Venezuela over a 24-hour period, leading to the resignation of President Hugo Chavez. It mentions a violent crackdown on a protest, resulting in deaths and injuries. There's a general strike and an oil industry stoppage. The new president, Pedro Carmona, changes the country's name and ends the strike. The military's role is significant, as they turned against Chavez after the violence. Chavez is detained and could face charges. The country is in shock, with deep social divisions and uncertainty about the future.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, ending with the specified tokens. I need to ensure the moral aspects are preserved. The original text portrays Chavez negatively, highlighting his authoritarian actions, the violence against protesters, and the military's betrayal. The summary should reflect this framing.

I'll start by mentioning the violent events leading to Chavez's resignation. Include the name change, the strike, the military's role, and the aftermath with uncertainty. Keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to highlight the moral issues: Chavez's authoritarianism, the violence, the military's involvement, and the resulting instability. That should capture the essence while preserving the original's tone.

SUMMARY: Venezuela experienced a tumultuous 24 hours, marked by violence, political upheaval, and significant changes in leadership. At least 11 people were killed and over 80 injured during protests and clashes, as a general strike and oil industry stoppage threatened the economy. Business leader Pedro Carmona became the new president, renaming the country from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. Carmona also ended the strike, which had been called to oppose President Hugo Chavez. The violence began when armed groups loyal to Chavez fired on peaceful protesters, leading to widespread condemnation and military intervention. Chavez, who had earlier taken control of national TV channels, was forced to resign and is now detained, facing potential charges. The country is in a state of shock, with deep social divisions and uncertainty about the future. While some celebrate Chavez's fall, others worry about how the nation's problems will be resolved. END OF SUMMARY.
