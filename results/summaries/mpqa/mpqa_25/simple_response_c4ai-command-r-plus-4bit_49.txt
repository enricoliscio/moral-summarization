SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a new and violent dawn as the country underwent a tumultuous transformation in the wake of a dramatic 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage ended abruptly with the rise of a new president, Pedro Carmona, who swiftly changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The strike, called by Carmona and the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers' leader, was in response to former President Hugo Chavez filling the state oil company's board with his supporters. Chavez's last day in power was marked by a peaceful rally that turned bloody when marchers calling for his resignation were fired upon, leading to his eventual resignation and detention. Venezuela now faces a power vacuum and deep social divisions that require healing. The challenge ahead is to address the country's problems while uniting a divided nation.
