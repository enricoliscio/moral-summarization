SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a transformed country after 24 hours of dramatic and violent events, leaving at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage, which threatened to cripple the economy, came to an end with the announcement of a new president, Pedro Carmona. The country's name was also changed from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to simply the Republic of Venezuela. The strike was sparked by former President Hugo Chavez's decision to fill the state oil company's board of directors with his supporters, leading to bloodshed during a peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans. Shots were fired into the crowd, and eyewitnesses reported snipers firing from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military eventually intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is now detained and could face charges for his role in the killings. The country is left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions, which need to be healed. END OF SUMMARY.
