Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key events and the moral implications as presented.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the events in Venezuela leading to Hugo Chavez's resignation. There's a strike, violence, name change, and the transition to a new president.

I need to include the morally charged words like "violent," "dead," "injured," "strike," "threatened," "cripple," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include these terms to maintain the author's framing.

I should structure the summary by highlighting the violent events, the impact on the country, the political changes, and the aftermath. I'll make sure to mention the number of casualties, the strike's purpose, the name change, and the military's role in Chavez's resignation.

Also, I need to convey the uncertainty and social divisions in Venezuela after the events. Including quotes from the article, like the eyewitness's account, will help maintain the moral tone.

I'll start by stating the transformation of Venezuela, then move on to the violent events, the strike, the name change, Chavez's actions, the military's intervention, and the current state of the country. I'll end with the challenges ahead.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. I should make each sentence concise, including only the most impactful details with the moral framing words.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
Venezuela underwent a dramatic transformation as violence and political upheaval marked the country's new chapter. At least 11 were killed and over 80 injured in violent clashes, with a general strike and oil industry stoppage threatening to cripple the economy. The new president, Pedro Carmona, renamed the country the Republic of Venezuela, dropping the "Bolivarian" title. The strike ended after Carmona's announcement, but the nation remained in shock. A peaceful rally of over 100,000 ended in bloodshed as shots were fired into the crowd, with eyewitnesses describing snipers and armed Chavez supporters indiscriminately firing. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which he reportedly accepted. Chavez is now detained, facing possible charges for his role in the killings. Amid flag-waving Venezuelans hoping to see him leave, the country faces a power vacuum and deep social divisions. While some celebrate Chavez's fall, uncertainty looms over how to address the nation's challenges.  
END OF SUMMARY.
