SUMMARY:
Venezuela underwent a dramatic transformation following a violent 24 hours that left 11 dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage ended abruptly with the installation of Pedro Carmona as the new president. He swiftly changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela, erasing the legacy of Hugo Chavez's hero, Simon Bolivar. The violent events, which saw peaceful protesters shot at indiscriminately by Chavez supporters and snipers, were the final straw for the military, who sided with the people. Chavez resigned under pressure and was detained, facing potential charges for the horrible killings. Venezuela now faces a power vacuum and deep social divisions, with uncertainty about how to solve the country's problems.
END OF SUMMARY.
