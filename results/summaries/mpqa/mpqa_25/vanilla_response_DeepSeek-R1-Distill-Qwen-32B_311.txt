Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. I should focus on the key events and changes.

First, the article mentions that Venezuelans woke up to a transformed country after 24 hours of violent events. At least 11 dead and 80 injured. There was a general strike and an oil stoppage that threatened the economy. Now, there's a new president, Pedro Carmona, and the country's name changed from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela.

The strike was called by Carmona and Carlos Ortega. PDVSA managers were striking because Chavez filled the board with his supporters. Despite the strike ending, traffic was light, and many didn't go to work. The country is in shock after a rally turned violent. Over 100,000 people protested, and shootings occurred, with snipers involved. Chavez supporters were seen shooting, and the military turned against him.

Chavez addressed the nation, took TV channels off air, then the military demanded his resignation. He's detained, and there's uncertainty about the country's future. Social divisions are deep, and people are both happy Chavez is gone but worried about solutions.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: the change in leadership, name change, the strike, violence, military involvement, Chavez's detention, and the resulting uncertainty.

I'll start by mentioning the new president and name change, then the strike and violence, followed by the military's role in Chavez's resignation, and conclude with the country's uncertainty and divisions.

SUMMARY: Venezuelans experienced a dramatic shift as a violent 24-hour period led to the ousting of President Hugo Chavez. At least 11 were killed and 80 injured during protests and clashes. A general strike and oil stoppage were ended by the new interim president, Pedro Carmona, who renamed the country from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. The strike was called to oppose Chavez's control over PDVSA, the state oil company. Violence erupted when pro-Chavez groups fired on protesters, prompting the military to demand Chavez's resignation. Chavez was detained, and his exit left the country in a state of uncertainty, with deep social divisions remaining unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
