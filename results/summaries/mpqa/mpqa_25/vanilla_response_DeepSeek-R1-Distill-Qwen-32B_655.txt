Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article talks about the dramatic events in Venezuela over 24 hours, leading to at least 11 deaths and 80 injuries. There was a general strike and an oil industry stoppage, which ended with a new president, Pedro Carmona. The country's name changed from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. That's a significant change, so I should include that.

Next, the strike was called by Carmona and Carlos Ortega, but despite the announcement ending the strike, many people didn't go to work. The country is in shock after a peaceful rally turned violent. Over 100,000 people were protesting, and it ended with shootings, which led to the military's involvement.

Chavez addressed the nation, took TV channels off air, and then faced military pressure. His resignation was accepted, and he's detained. His family left the country. People are celebrating his fall but are uncertain about the future. The country has a power vacuum and social divisions to heal.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and covers all these points succinctly. I'll structure it to start with the new president and name change, then the strike, the violence, military involvement, Chavez's resignation, and the current situation.
