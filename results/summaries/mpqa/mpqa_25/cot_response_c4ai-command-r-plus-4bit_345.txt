SUMMARY:
Venezuela woke up to a new and transformed reality after a violent 24 hours that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The general strike and oil industry stoppage ended abruptly with the installation of a new president, Pedro Carmona, who swiftly changed the country's name from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Republic of Venezuela. The violent events of the previous day, which saw a peaceful rally of over 100,000 middle-class Venezuelans turn into bloodshed as marchers demanding the resignation of former president Hugo Chavez were fired upon, ultimately led to Chavez's own resignation. Chavez's last-minute address to the nation, in which he accused television channels of lying about his government, was followed by the announcement of their removal from the air. The military, appalled by the killings, sided with the people, and Chavez found himself holed up in negotiations to save his presidency. Ultimately, he resigned and was detained, leaving a power vacuum in the country. The challenge now is to address the deep social divisions and uncertainties about how to solve Venezuela's problems.
