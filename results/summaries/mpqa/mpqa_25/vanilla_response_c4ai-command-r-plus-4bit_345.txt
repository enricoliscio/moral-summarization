SUMMARY: Venezuela awoke to a country transformed after a tumultuous 24 hours that resulted in 11 deaths and over 80 injuries. The general strike and oil industry stoppage ended with the installation of a new president, Pedro Carmona, who changed the country's name back to the Republic of Venezuela. Carmona's first acts included ending the strike and renaming the country. The events were triggered by Chavez's decision to fill the state oil company's board with his supporters, leading to a violent rally outside the presidential palace where marchers were shot at by snipers and armed Chavez supporters. Chavez's resignation was demanded and accepted, leaving a power vacuum in the country. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions within Venezuela and address the country's problems. Venezuelans are hopeful but uncertain about the future.
END OF SUMMARY.
