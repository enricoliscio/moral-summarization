SUMMARY:
Venezuela has awoken to a new dawn after a dramatic and violent 24 hours that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country is in shellshock after a peaceful rally of over 100,000 mainly middle-class Venezuelans ended in bloodshed. Shots were fired into the crowd by snipers and armed supporters of former President Hugo Chavez, who had filled the state oil company's board of directors with his supporters. The military, horrified by the killings, demanded Chavez's resignation, which was accepted. Chavez is currently detained and could face charges for his role in the killings. The country is now left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions, and the challenge is to heal these wounds. While many Venezuelans are happy to see Chavez fall, there is also uncertainty about how the country's problems will be solved. END OF SUMMARY.
