SUMMARY:

Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24-hour period that left 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after the removal of the "Bolivarian" label. The change came after a general strike and oil industry stoppage threatened to cripple the economy. The strike was sparked by former President Hugo Chavez's appointment of his supporters to the state oil company's board of directors. A peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans turned bloody when shots were fired into the crowd, prompting the military to demand Chavez's resignation. He is now detained and may face charges for his role in the killings. The country is left with a power vacuum and deep social divisions, but many Venezuelans are relieved to see the end of Chavez's rule. The challenge now is to heal the country's wounds and find a long-term leader.
