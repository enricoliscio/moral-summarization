Alright, I need to summarize this article about Venezuela's recent events. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a significant change in Venezuela after violent events led to the resignation of President Hugo Chavez. 

First, the key points are: the general strike and oil industry stoppage ended, a new president, Pedro Carmona, took over, the country's name changed from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. There were violent clashes with at least 11 deaths and 80 injuries. The military played a role in forcing Chavez's resignation. Chavez was detained and might face charges. The country is now in a state of uncertainty with deep social divisions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the dramatic events leading to Chavez's resignation, the new president, the name change, the violence, military involvement, and the current state of uncertainty.

I should ensure the summary includes the main events and their implications. Make sure it's clear and concise, highlighting the transformation and the challenges ahead.
