SUMMARY:
Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours, leaving at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country now has a new president, Pedro Carmona, and a new name, the Republic of Venezuela, after the removal of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The name change was Carmona's first act as head of the transition government. The previous day's peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans ended in bloodshed, with snipers and armed supporters of former president Hugo Chavez firing indiscriminately at the crowd. The "horrible" killings were the final straw for the military, leading to Chavez's resignation. The challenge now is to heal the deep social divisions that exist within the country, and to find a long-term leader. While many Venezuelans are happy that Chavez has fallen, there is also uncertainty about how the country's problems will be solved. END OF SUMMARY.
