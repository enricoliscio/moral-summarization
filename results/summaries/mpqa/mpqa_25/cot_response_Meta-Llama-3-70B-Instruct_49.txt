SUMMARY:
Venezuela has undergone a dramatic transformation after a violent 24 hours that left at least 11 people dead and over 80 injured. The country is now under a new president, Pedro Carmona, and has been renamed the Republic of Venezuela, shedding its former title honoring Simon Bolivar. The new leader's first acts were to end the general strike and announce the end of the oil industry stoppage. However, the country remains in a state of shock and uncertainty. The previous day's peaceful rally of over 100,000 Venezuelans turned into bloodshed when shots were fired into the crowd, with eyewitnesses claiming snipers fired from rooftops near the presidential palace. The military ultimately demanded and accepted President Hugo Chavez's resignation, citing the "intolerable" killings. Chavez is now detained and could face charges for his role in the violence. As the country begins to heal, it faces deep social divisions and uncertainty about its future. END OF SUMMARY.
