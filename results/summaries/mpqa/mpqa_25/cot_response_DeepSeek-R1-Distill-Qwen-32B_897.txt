Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those terms.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and look for words that carry moral connotations. Words like "transformed," "dramatic," "violent," "dead," "injured," "general strike," "cripple," "new president," "name change," "heroes," "filled," "striking," "oppression," "shellshocked," "peaceful rally," "bloodshed," "resignation," "snipers," "firing," "defenceless," "atrocity," "respect," "freedom," "lying," "final straw," "military," "support," "killing," "not tolerable," "tanks," "holed up," "resignation," "detained," "charges," "flag-waving," "uncertainty," "problems," "vacuum," "divisions," "heal."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into under 200 words, using as many of these morally charged words as possible. I'll start by outlining the key events: the violent events leading to Chavez's resignation, the new president, the name change, the strike, the shootings, military involvement, and the aftermath.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, such as the violence, the military's role, the impact on the country, and the uncertainty following Chavez's fall. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, covering the main points while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Venezuela experienced a violent and transformative 24 hours, with at least 11 deaths and 80 injuries. A general strike and oil industry stoppage ended as Pedro Carmona became the new president, renaming the country from the Bolivarian Republic to the Republic of Venezuela. The strike was called to protest Hugo Chavez's control over PDVSA. Violence erupted when Chavez supporters fired on peaceful protesters, leading to widespread shock. The military intervened, demanding Chavez's resignation, which he accepted. Chavez was detained, and his exit left the country in a power vacuum. While some celebrated his fall, others felt uncertainty about solving the nation's deep divisions. END OF SUMMARY.
