SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied in Havana to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing comparisons between the failed coup against him and the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The rally took place on the same street corner where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by a CIA-trained exile army to overthrow Castro's government. Cuban officials praised Venezuelans for their dignified and honorable response to the coup attempt, with both Chavez and Castro being leftists who consider each other close allies. The United States denied any involvement in Chavez's brief ouster. The Bay of Pigs invasion, similarly, was a failed attempt to overthrow Castro's government by the United States, resulting in the death and capture of many exiles. The rally highlighted the strong ties between Cuba and Venezuela and their shared history of resisting U.S.-backed attempts to overthrow their leftist governments. END OF SUMMARY.
