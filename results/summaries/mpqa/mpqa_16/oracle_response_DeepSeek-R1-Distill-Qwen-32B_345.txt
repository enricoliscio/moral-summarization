Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want a news summary that preserves the moral framing of the original article. The article is about Cubans celebrating the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez after a failed coup, comparing it to the Bay of Pigs invasion. 

First, I need to understand the moral words used by the author. They include words like "coup," "disastrous," "overthrow," "invasion," etc. My task is to summarize the article while keeping as many of these morally charged words as possible.

I should start by identifying the main points of the article. Thousands of Cubans celebrated Chavez's return, comparing the failed coup to the Bay of Pigs. The event was held at the same spot where Castro declared socialism before the Bay of Pigs invasion. A Communist Party official called it a beautiful coincidence. Both Castro and Chavez are leftists and allies against the US. The US denied involvement in the coup, but Cuba was quick to denounce it. The Bay of Pigs was a failed CIA attempt to overthrow Castro, resulting in many deaths and captures.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the moral words like "coup," "disastrous," "overthrow," "invasion," etc. I should mention the celebration, the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the Communist Party's statement, the US denial, and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral perspective. I'll structure it by first stating the celebration, then the comparison, followed by the significance of the location, the Communist Party's view, the political alliance between Castro and Chavez, the US reaction, and a brief mention of the Bay of Pigs outcome.

I should also check the word count to make sure it's concise. Let me draft it out, making sure to include all key points and the morally framed words without making it too lengthy.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all important elements are included and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup against him and the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. The rally took place at the same Havana corner where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, just days before the CIA-trained exile force invaded. Castro supporters, including workers, students, and retirees, gathered to honor the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the celebration following Venezuelans' efforts to overthrow the coup attempt. Both Castro and Chavez are leftist leaders, with Castro calling Chavez his closest ally in the region. Cuba swiftly condemned the coup, which was reversed when loyalist military officers reinstated Chavez after public demonstrations. The U.S. denied encouraging the coup, but the event highlighted the enduring tensions between the U.S., Cuba, and Venezuela. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained attempt to overthrow Castro, resulted in the deaths of 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000 others, further underscoring the region's history of political conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
