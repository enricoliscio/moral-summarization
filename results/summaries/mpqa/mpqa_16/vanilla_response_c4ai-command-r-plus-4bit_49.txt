SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, comparing the failed coup to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally took place on the street corner where Fidel Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. A Cuban official likened the Venezuelan's people's response to the coup to the Cuban victory at the Bay of Pigs. Both Chavez and Castro are leftists and allies, with close ties that have drawn ire from the US. Cuba swiftly denounced Chavez's ouster and supported his reinstatement. The article also mentions the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by CIA-trained exiles to overthrow Castro's government in 1961.
