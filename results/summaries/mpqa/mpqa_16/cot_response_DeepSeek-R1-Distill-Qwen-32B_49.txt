Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify the morally framed words first. Let me read the article carefully.

The article is about Cubans celebrating Chavez's return to power after a failed coup. They compare it to the Bay of Pigs invasion. I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "celebrate," "failed," "disastrous," "overthrow," "dignity," "honor," "friend," "loyalist," "encouraged," "seized," "failed," "killed," "captured."

Now, for the summary. I should include these words to maintain the moral tone. I'll start by mentioning the celebration and the comparison. Highlight the rally and the historical context. Then, talk about the failed coup and the US's role, using words like "failed," "disastrous," and "encouraged." Also, emphasize the support for Chavez and the regional alliance against US influence. Finally, mention the Bay of Pigs outcome to show the parallels. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

**SUMMARY:**  
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup against him and the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. The rally, held at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the celebration following Venezuelans' efforts to overthrow the coup attempt. Both Castro and Chavez are seen as revolutionary leaders, with Cuba viewing Chavez as a close ally. Cuba swiftly denounced the coup, which was reversed when loyalist military officers reinstated Chavez after public demonstrations. The U.S. denied encouraging the coup, though the event underscored the tensions between leftist leaders and U.S. influence in the region. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed CIA-backed attempt to overthrow Castro, resulted in the deaths of 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000, serving as a stark reminder of historical parallels.
