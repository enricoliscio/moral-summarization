SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup against the Cuban ally to the disastrous U.S.-backed effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's government 41 years ago. The celebration was seen as a "beautiful historic coincidence" by a top local Communist Party official, as Venezuelans "have written a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. Castro and Chavez, both leftists who see themselves as revolutionary leaders, have a close friendship, which has rankled the United States. Cuba swiftly denounced the Venezuelan president's ouster, and the Bush administration brushed aside suggestions that it quietly encouraged the removal of Chavez. The event was reminiscent of the Bay of Pigs, a CIA-trained force of about 1,500 exiles that invaded Cuba in an effort to overthrow Castro's government, which failed, killing about 100 of the invaders and capturing 1,000.
