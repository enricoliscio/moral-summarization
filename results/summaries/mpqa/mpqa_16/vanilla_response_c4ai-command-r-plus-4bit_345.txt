SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied in Havana to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup in Venezuela and the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. The event was held at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist on the eve of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by a CIA-trained exile army to overthrow Castro's government. Cuban officials praised Venezuelans for their response to Chavez's ouster, highlighting the strong ties between the two leftist leaders. The rally also criticized the US, suggesting their involvement in Chavez's removal, which the Bush administration denied. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a defining moment in Cuba's history, ended in defeat for the US-backed exiles, solidifying Castro's power. The article emphasizes the significance of the two events in the context of US-Latin American relations and the shared ideology of Chavez and Castro. END OF SUMMARY.
