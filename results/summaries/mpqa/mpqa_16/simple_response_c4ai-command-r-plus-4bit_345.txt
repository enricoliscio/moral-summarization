SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup against him and the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by the US to overthrow Fidel Castro's government in 1961. The celebration took place on the same street corner where Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Jorge Arias, a Communist Party official, highlighted the coincidence of the events, praising Venezuelans for their dignity and honor in rejecting the coup. The strong bond between Chavez and Castro, two leftist leaders, has been a source of tension with the United States. Cuba was quick to condemn Chavez's temporary ouster and welcomed his reinstatement, which was secured through the loyalty of the military and the will of the people. The US denied any involvement in the coup attempt. The Bay of Pigs invasion, carried out by CIA-trained exiles, ended in failure, resulting in heavy losses and the capture of many invaders.
