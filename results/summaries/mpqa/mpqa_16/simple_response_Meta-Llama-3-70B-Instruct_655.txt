SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels with the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government. The rally, attended by 4,000 Castro supporters, highlighted the "historic coincidence" of the two events, with both leaders seen as revolutionary figures fighting against imperialist forces. Cuba was quick to denounce Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration denied allegations of quietly encouraging his removal. The event underscored the close ties between Castro and Chavez, who are united in their leftist ideology and opposition to U.S. influence in the region. The celebration was seen as a testament to the power of the people in defending their democratically-elected leaders against foreign-backed coup attempts.
