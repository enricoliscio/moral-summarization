SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup against him to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The event was seen as a "beautiful historic coincidence" by a top local Communist Party official, as it came soon after Venezuelans "wrote a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. Cuba was swift to denounce Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration later brushed aside suggestions that it quietly encouraged his removal. Castro, a self-proclaimed revolutionary leader, considers Chavez a friend and his closest political ally in the region. The celebration was a show of loyalty and solidarity between the two leftist leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
