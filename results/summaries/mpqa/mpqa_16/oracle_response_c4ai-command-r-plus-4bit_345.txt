SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied to celebrate the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to power, drawing parallels between the botched coup against him and the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The rally took place on the street corner where Fidel Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the disastrous invasion. Local Communist Party official Jorge Arias praised Venezuelans for "writing a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets and overthrowing the coup attempt. He also highlighted the close ties between the leftist leaders of Cuba and Venezuela, which have been a source of tension with the United States. The U.S. denied allegations of encouraging Chavez's removal. The Bay of Pigs invasion, carried out by a CIA-trained exile army, ended in failure, with significant casualties and captives.
END OF SUMMARY.
