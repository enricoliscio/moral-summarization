Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Cubans celebrating Hugo Chavez's return to power after a failed coup. They compared it to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The event happened in Havana, and about 4,000 people attended. They gathered at the spot where Fidel Castro declared socialism before the Bay of Pigs in 1961. A Communist Party official called it a historic coincidence that this celebration happened so soon after the Venezuelan coup attempt was foiled.

Both Castro and Chavez are leftists and consider themselves revolutionary leaders. Cuba supports Chavez, which annoys the US. The US denied any involvement in the coup, and the Bay of Pigs was a failed CIA operation to overthrow Castro.

So, the main points are:
- Cubans celebrated Chavez's return, comparing it to the Bay of Pigs.
- The event was at the same location as Castro's 1961 speech.
- Castro and Chavez are allies, which is against US interests.
- The US denied involvement in the coup.
- The Bay of Pigs was a failed CIA attempt to overthrow Castro.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points and preserves the moral framing. The original article highlights the solidarity between Cuba and Venezuela against US influence, so I should emphasize that.

Let me structure the summary: start with the celebration, mention the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the gathering location, the Communist Party's comment, the US denial, and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it concisely, making sure to include all key points and the moral aspect of opposing US intervention.

SUMMARY: Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup against him and the Bay of Pigs invasion. Thousands gathered in Havana at the site where Fidel Castro declared socialism before the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. A Communist Party official highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the celebration following the Venezuelan coup attempt's defeat. Both Castro and Chavez, as leftist revolutionary leaders, view their alliance as a counter to US influence. The US denied involvement in the coup, while the Bay of Pigs, a failed CIA operation, remains a symbol of resistance against foreign intervention. END OF SUMMARY.
