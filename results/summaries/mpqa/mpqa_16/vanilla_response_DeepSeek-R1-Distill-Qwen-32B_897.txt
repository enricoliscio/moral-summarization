Okay, I need to summarize this news article. The user is asking for a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points.

First, the article is about Cubans celebrating Hugo Chavez's return to power. They compared the failed coup in Venezuela to the Bay of Pigs invasion. I should note that thousands attended a rally in Havana.

Next, the event's significance: it's where Castro declared socialism before the Bay of Pigs in 1961. The Communist Party official mentioned the coincidence of timing, linking Venezuela's coup failure to this historical event.

Castro and Chavez are both leftists and allies, which is important because their relationship annoys the US. Cuba quickly condemned the coup and supported Chavez's reinstatement.

Also, the US administration denied any involvement in the coup, and the Bay of Pigs details are included for context.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures all these points clearly. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key element is included without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Cubans gathered in Havana to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup in Venezuela and the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally, attended by thousands, took place at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist before the U.S.-backed invasion. A Communist Party official called the timing a "beautiful historic coincidence," highlighting Venezuelans' resistance to the coup. Both Castro and Chavez are leftist allies, with Cuba strongly supporting Chavez during the coup and its reversal. The U.S. denied involvement in the coup, while the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed CIA operation, remains a symbol of U.S. interference in Cuban affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
