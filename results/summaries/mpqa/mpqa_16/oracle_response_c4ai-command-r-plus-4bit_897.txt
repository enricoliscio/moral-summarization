SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied to celebrate the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to power, drawing parallels between the botched coup in Venezuela and the failed US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. The rally took place on the street corner where Fidel Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. Local Communist Party official Jorge Arias highlighted the symbolic nature of the event, praising Venezuelans for their courage in overthrowing the coup attempt. The close ties between Chavez and Castro have been a source of tension with the United States, which denied allegations of involvement in the Venezuelan leader's brief removal from power. The Bay of Pigs invasion, carried out by CIA-trained exiles, ended in disaster, with many invaders killed or captured. The failed attempts to overthrow these leftist leaders, seen as revolutionary icons, have become symbolic moments in the history of both nations. END OF SUMMARY.
