SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied in Havana to celebrate the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The failed coup against Chavez was compared to the Bay of Pigs invasion, a disastrous attempt by the United States to overthrow Castro's government in 1961. The event was commemorated as a victory for dignity and honor, with Cubans showing their support for Chavez and their rejection of foreign interference. The strong ties between Cuba and Venezuela, and their leaders' leftist and revolutionary ideals, have caused tension with the United States. The US denied allegations of involvement in the Venezuelan coup but had previously trained and supported the exile army that invaded Cuba during the Bay of Pigs incident. The celebration in Havana highlighted the shared history and values of the two countries and served as a reminder of their resistance to external influences. END OF SUMMARY.
