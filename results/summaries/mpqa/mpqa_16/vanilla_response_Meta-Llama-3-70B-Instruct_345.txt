SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power at a rally in Havana, comparing the failed coup against him to the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. A top Communist Party official called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came soon after Venezuelans took to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. Cuba was quick to denounce Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration denied suggestions that it encouraged his removal. The Bay of Pigs invasion, which was backed by the US, failed to overthrow Castro's government, resulting in the deaths of about 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000 others. Castro considers Chavez a friend and close political ally, and their ties have strained relations with the US.
