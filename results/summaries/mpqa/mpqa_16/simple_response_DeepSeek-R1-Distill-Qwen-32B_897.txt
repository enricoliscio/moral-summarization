Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. The article is about Cubans celebrating Chavez's return and comparing it to the Bay of Pigs. I should focus on the key points: the celebration, the comparison, the historical context, and the implications for US-Cuba relations. I'll make sure to highlight the symbolic link between the two events and the stance against US interference. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all essential details. I'll start by stating the celebration, then the comparison, followed by the historical context, and end with the significance of the event. I should also mention the US's denial of involvement to show the tension. That should cover the moral aspects and the main narrative the author intended.

SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans gathered to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup against him and the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro. The event, held at the symbolic site where Castro declared Cuba socialist, emphasized the historical and ideological connection between the two leftist leaders. Castro and Chavez are seen as revolutionary allies, with Cuba quickly denouncing the coup attempt and supporting Chavez's reinstatement. The celebration highlighted the shared struggle against U.S. influence, as both leaders oppose American interference in Latin America. The Bush administration denied any involvement in the Venezuelan coup, but the rally underscored the ongoing tension between the U.S. and these leftist governments. END OF SUMMARY.
