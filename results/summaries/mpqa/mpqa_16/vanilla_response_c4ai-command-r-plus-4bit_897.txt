SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied in Havana to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup in Venezuela and the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba in 1961. The event was held on the street corner where Fidel Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by a CIA-trained exile army to overthrow Castro's government. A top Communist Party official, Jorge Arias, highlighted the coincidence of the celebration and Venezuela's recent events, where Chavez was ousted and then reinstated following mass demonstrations. The strong ties between Chavez and Castro, both leftist leaders, have caused tension with the United States. The U.S. denied suggestions that it encouraged Chavez's removal. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a defining moment in Cuba's history, ended with the defeat of the exile army and the consolidation of Castro's power. END OF SUMMARY.
