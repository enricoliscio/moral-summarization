Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Cubans celebrating the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to power. They compared the failed coup against him to the Bay of Pigs invasion. 

So, the main points are: thousands of Cubans held a rally in Havana, they linked the Venezuelan coup attempt to the Bay of Pigs, which was a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro in 1961. They gathered at the spot where Castro declared socialism before the Bay of Pigs invasion. A Communist Party official mentioned the historical coincidence of celebrating just after the coup in Venezuela was foiled. 

Both Castro and Chavez are leftist leaders, and their alliance is significant, especially since it annoys the U.S. Cuba quickly condemned the coup when it happened and supported Chavez's reinstatement. The Bush administration denied any involvement in encouraging the coup. The Bay of Pigs involved a CIA-trained force of 1,500 exiles, which failed, leading to many deaths and captures.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the celebration, the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the significance of the location, the officials' comments, the U.S. reaction, and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs.

Let me structure it: Start with the celebration, link to Bay of Pigs, mention the rally location and its historical significance, the Communist Party official's statement, the U.S. denying involvement, and a brief mention of the Bay of Pigs outcome.

I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without unnecessary details. Also, ensure it flows well and is within the word limit.
