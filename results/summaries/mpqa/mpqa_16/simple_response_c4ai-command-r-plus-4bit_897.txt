SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup in Venezuela and the Bay of Pigs invasion, a historic attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government in Cuba. The celebration takes place at a symbolic location, where Castro once declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Jorge Arias, a Communist Party official, emphasizes the significance of the event, praising Venezuelans for their courage in overturning the coup attempt. The strong relationship between Chavez and Castro, two leftist leaders, is highlighted, along with their shared opposition to the United States. The United States, for its part, denies any involvement in the Venezuelan coup. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-backed operation, ended in failure, resulting in significant casualties and the capture of many exiles. The celebration in Cuba serves as a reminder of the resilience of leftist ideologies in the region and the enduring solidarity between Cuba and Venezuela. END OF SUMMARY.
