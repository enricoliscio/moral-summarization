SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at a historic site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, and was attended by 4,000 Castro supporters. A top Communist Party official called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came soon after Venezuelans "wrote a page of dignity and honor" by overthrowing the coup attempt. Castro and Chavez are leftists who see themselves as revolutionary leaders, and their close ties have rankled the United States. Cuba swiftly denounced Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration brushed aside suggestions that it quietly encouraged the removal of Chavez. The Bay of Pigs invasion, which failed and resulted in the deaths of about 100 exiles, is seen as a disastrous attempt to overthrow Castro's government. END OF SUMMARY.
