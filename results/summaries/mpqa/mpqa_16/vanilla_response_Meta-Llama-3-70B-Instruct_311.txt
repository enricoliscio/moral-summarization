SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power at a rally in Havana, comparing the failed coup against him to the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state 41 years ago. A top Communist Party official called the coincidence "beautiful" and praised Venezuelans for defending their president. Castro considers Chavez a close friend and ally, and their ties have strained relations with the US. Cuba quickly denounced Chavez's ouster, which was reversed two days later when loyalist officers reinstated him. The US denied encouraging the coup attempt. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained force of 1,500 exiles, failed to overthrow Castro's government, resulting in 100 deaths and 1,000 captures. The celebrations in Havana highlighted the strong bond between the two leftist leaders and their shared history of resisting US-backed coups.
