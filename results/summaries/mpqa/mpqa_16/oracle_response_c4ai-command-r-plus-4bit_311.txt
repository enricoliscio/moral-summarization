SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally of Fidel Castro's government, after a botched coup attempt. The failed overthrow, led by Venezuelan dissidents and indirectly supported by the US, was likened to the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained effort to invade Cuba and remove Fidel Castro from power 41 years earlier. The rally, attended by about 4,000 Castro supporters, commemorated the anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion and celebrated the reinstatement of Chavez, who was briefly ousted from power but quickly returned after massive demonstrations in his favor. The United States denied any involvement in the Venezuelan coup, but the close ties between Chavez and Castro, both leftist leaders, have long rankled US officials. The article highlights the historical coincidence of two revolutionary leaders facing similar challenges to their power, with the Cuban people drawing parallels between the two events and celebrating the preservation of their socialist ideals.
