Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about Cubans celebrating Chavez's return to power and comparing the coup attempt to the Bay of Pigs. The user provided an example response, so I can use that as a reference. In the example, they identified words like "celebrate," "return," "failed," "disastrous," "overthrow," "dignity," "honor," "friend," "loyalist," "failed," "killed," "captured."

I need to go through the article and pick out all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words that express approval, disapproval, or have a value judgment. For example, "celebrate" shows approval, "failed" indicates disapproval, "disastrous" is negative, "overthrow" is a strong action, "dignity" and "honor" are positive, "friend" is positive, "loyalist" is positive, "killed" and "captured" are negative outcomes.

Once I have all those words, I need to write a concise summary that includes them. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article, highlighting the moral aspects. I should make sure to include the key events: the celebration in Havana, the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the support for Chavez, the US's reaction, and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the celebration, then the comparison, the support from Cuba, the US's denial of involvement, and the outcome of the coup attempt. I need to make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing.

Let me make sure I don't miss any important details. The article mentions that about 4,000 people gathered, the location where Castro declared socialism, the failed coup, the US's brush-off, and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs. I should include these points in the summary to ensure it's comprehensive.

I also need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it accurately reflects the original article's content and maintains the moral framing by including the identified words. This way, the user gets a precise and morally framed summary that meets their requirements.

**SUMMARY:**  
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, comparing the failed coup against him to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion. They gathered at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, marking a "beautiful historic coincidence" after Venezuelans showed dignity and honor by thwarting the coup. Both Castro and Chavez are leftist revolutionary leaders, with Cuba viewing Chavez as a friend and key ally. The U.S. denied encouraging the coup, while Cuba swiftly denounced the attempt and supported Chavez's reinstatement. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed CIA-backed attempt to overthrow Castro, resulted in many deaths and captures, serving as a reminder of past U.S. intervention.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
