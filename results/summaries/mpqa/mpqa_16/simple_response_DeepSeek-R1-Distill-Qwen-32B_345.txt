The article talks about Cubans celebrating Hugo Chavez's return to power after a failed coup, comparing it to the Bay of Pigs invasion. It mentions the rally in Havana, the participants, and the officials' statements. There's also a part about the Bush administration's denial of involvement in the coup.

Okay, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words. I should focus on the key elements: the celebration, the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the political ties between Cuba and Venezuela, and the U.S.'s reaction. I need to make sure the moral framing is kept, so highlighting the solidarity between left-wing leaders and the opposition to U.S. involvement is important.

I'll start by mentioning the celebration, then the comparison. I should include that both leaders see themselves as revolutionary. Also, note the U.S. denial to show the tension. I'll make sure to keep it concise, hitting all these points without going over the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds value and stays within the summary guidelines.
