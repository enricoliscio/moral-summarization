SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing comparisons between the failed coup in Venezuela and the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government in Cuba in 1961. The celebration highlights the strong ideological and political ties between Chavez and Castro, who view themselves as leftist revolutionary leaders. The Cuban government was quick to denounce the ouster of Chavez and rejoiced in his swift reinstatement. The event also serves as a reminder of the contentious relationship between the United States and both Venezuela and Cuba, with the US denying any involvement in the Venezuelan coup. The Bay of Pigs invasion, carried out by CIA-trained exiles, ended in defeat, solidifying Castro's power and becoming a pivotal moment in US-Cuban relations. The failed coup in Venezuela, similarly, has sparked discussions about the role of foreign influence and the resilience of leftist movements in the region.
