SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally, attended by 4,000 Castro supporters, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of Venezuelans defending their democracy against a coup attempt. The event underscored the close ties between Cuba and Venezuela, with both leaders seen as revolutionary figures. The US has been critical of these relationships, but the Bush administration denied any involvement in Chavez's ouster. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-backed effort to overthrow Castro's government, failed miserably, resulting in the deaths of 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000. The moral of the story is clear: the people's will to defend their democracy and sovereignty cannot be defeated by external forces. The celebration in Havana served as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up against imperialism and defending the principles of revolution and social justice.
