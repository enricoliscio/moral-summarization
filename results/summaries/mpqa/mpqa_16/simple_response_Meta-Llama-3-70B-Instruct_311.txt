SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally, attended by 4,000 Castro supporters, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the two events. Both Castro and Chavez are seen as revolutionary leaders, and their close ties have been a thorn in the side of the United States. Cuba was quick to denounce Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration has denied quietly encouraging his removal. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained force of 1,500 exiles, failed to overthrow Castro's government, resulting in the deaths of 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000. The celebration served as a testament to the dignity and honor of the Venezuelan people, who took to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. The event reinforced the strong bond between Cuba and Venezuela, built on shared values of revolution and socialism.
