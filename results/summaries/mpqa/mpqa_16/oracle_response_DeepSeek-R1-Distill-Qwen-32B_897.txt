Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the author's moral perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Cubans celebrating Hugo Chavez's return to power after a failed coup, comparing it to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The author uses specific morally charged words like "coup," "disastrous," and "overthrow."

I need to identify the key events: the celebration in Havana, the comparison to the Bay of Pigs, the failed coup attempt, and the U.S.'s involvement. Also, note the terms like "disastrous," "overthrow," and "invasion" which carry moral weight.

I should start the summary by highlighting the celebration and the comparison. Then, mention the rally location and its significance. Include the failed coup, the U.S. involvement, and the quick reinstatement of Chavez. Also, touch on the Bush administration's denial of involvement and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs.

I must ensure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and includes as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it to flow logically, connecting the celebration to the historical event and the current political dynamics between Cuba, Venezuela, and the U.S.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's concise, captures the moral framing, and includes all necessary points without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power after a failed coup, drawing parallels to the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally, held at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the event following Venezuela's successful resistance to the coup. Castro and Chavez, both leftist revolutionary leaders, were praised for their resilience. Cuba quickly condemned the coup attempt, which was reversed when loyalist forces reinstated Chavez after widespread demonstrations. The U.S. denied encouraging the coup, though the article underscores the tension between the U.S. and the two leaders. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained force's failed attempt to overthrow Castro, serves as a symbolic backdrop, emphasizing the historical and moral parallels between the two events.
