SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to power, drawing comparisons between the failed coup against him and the Bay of Pigs invasion, a disastrous attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government in 1961. The rally, attended by about 4,000 Castro supporters, commemorated the declaration of Cuba as a socialist nation on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The failed coup in Venezuela, where Chavez was briefly ousted before being reinstated, was seen as a victory for dignity and honor. Both Chavez and Castro are left-wing leaders who consider each other allies, and their relationship has been a source of tension with the United States. The article also highlights the denial by the Bush administration of any involvement in the Venezuelan coup attempt, while recalling the CIA's role in the Bay of Pigs invasion, which resulted in the deaths and capture of many exiled invaders. The celebration served as a reminder of Cuba's long-standing resistance to external efforts to overthrow its government.
