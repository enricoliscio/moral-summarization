SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally of Fidel Castro, following a failed coup attempt. The celebrations took place on the street corner where Castro had declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years earlier. The event was likened to a beautiful historic coincidence by a local Communist Party official, praising Venezuelans for their dignity and honor in overthrowing the coup attempt. The strong relationship between Chavez and Castro, who consider each other revolutionary friends, has caused tension with the United States, who denied involvement in the attempted removal of Chavez. The failed coup and the Bay of Pigs invasion, both aimed at overthrowing leftist leaders, share similarities in their failure and the moral courage displayed by those who opposed them. END OF SUMMARY.
