SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup against him to the disastrous U.S.-backed effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's government 41 years ago. The celebration was seen as a "beautiful historic coincidence" by a top local Communist Party official, as it came soon after Venezuelans "wrote a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. Castro and Chavez, both leftists who see themselves as revolutionary leaders, have a close and strong alliance that has rankled the United States. Cuba was swift to denounce the Venezuelan president's ouster, while the Bush administration brushed aside suggestions that it quietly encouraged the removal of Chavez. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt to overthrow Castro's government, was also recalled during the celebration. END OF SUMMARY.
