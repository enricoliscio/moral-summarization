Okay, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions. First, they want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Then, I have to write a summary preserving those moral framings.

Starting with the article, it's about Cubans celebrating Chavez's return to power after a failed coup, comparing it to the Bay of Pigs. I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "celebrate," "failed," "disastrous," "ally," "dignity," "honor," "overthrow," "rankled," "brushed aside," "attempt," "failed," "killed," "captured." These words have positive or negative moral implications.

Next, the summary needs to include as many of these words as possible. I should keep it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the celebration, the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the rally details, and the officials' comments. I'll note the failed coup, the Cuban support, the US reaction, and the historical context of the Bay of Pigs. I need to ensure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use words like "celebrated," "failed," "disastrous," "ally," "dignity," "honor," "overthrow," "rankled," "brushed aside," "attempt," "failed," "killed," "captured."

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the event, the comparison, the rally, the officials' statements, the US reaction, and the historical context. Making sure each sentence includes the morally framed words where appropriate without making it sound forced.

I should also check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Let me draft it and count the words. It looks like it's within the limit. I'll make sure all the key points are covered and that the moral framing is clear throughout the summary.

**STEP 1:**  
* celebrate  
* failed  
* disastrous  
* ally  
* dignity  
* honor  
* overthrown  
* rankled  
* brushed aside  
* attempt  
* failed  
* killed  
* captured  

**SUMMARY:**  
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, comparing the failed coup against him to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally, held at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, drew 4,000 supporters, including workers, students, and retirees. Officials called the event a "beautiful historic coincidence," emphasizing Venezuelans' "dignity and honor" in thwarting the coup. Both Castro and Chavez, seen as revolutionary leaders, have strong ties, irritating the U.S. Cuba quickly condemned the coup, which was reversed when loyalist officers reinstated Chavez after public demonstrations. The Bush administration denied involvement in the coup. The Bay of Pigs, a CIA-backed attempt to overthrow Castro in 1961, failed, with 100 invaders killed and 1,000 captured. END OF SUMMARY.
