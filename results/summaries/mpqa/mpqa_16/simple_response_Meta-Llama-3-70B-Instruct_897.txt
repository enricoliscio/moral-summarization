SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels with the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that attempted to overthrow Fidel Castro's government. The rally, attended by 4,000 Castro supporters, was seen as a "beautiful historic coincidence" as Venezuelans had just "written a page of dignity and honor" by resisting the coup attempt. Both Castro and Chavez are leftist leaders who consider themselves revolutionaries, and their close ties have been a thorn in the side of the United States. The Bush administration denied any involvement in the coup attempt, but Cuba was quick to denounce Chavez's ouster and hailed his reinstatement as a victory for the people. The celebration served as a powerful reminder of the importance of resisting imperialist interventions and upholding the principles of sovereignty and self-determination.
