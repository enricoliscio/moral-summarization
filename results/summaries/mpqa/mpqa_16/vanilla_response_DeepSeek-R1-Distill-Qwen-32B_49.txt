Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Cubans celebrating Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power. The user wants a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the celebration in Havana, comparing the coup attempt in Venezuela to the Bay of Pigs, the historical context, and the relationship between Castro and Chavez. 

I should mention that thousands of Cubans gathered, likening the failed coup to the Bay of Pigs, which was a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow Castro. It's important to note that both leaders are leftists and allies, which annoys the U.S. Also, the Bush administration denied involvement in the coup.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main events and comparisons without getting too detailed. I should structure it to flow from the celebration to the historical reference, then to the relationship between the leaders and the U.S. reaction.

Let me make sure I include all the key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the celebration, mention the comparison, the historical context, the leaders' alliance, and the U.S. denial. That should cover the essential information succinctly.

SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans gathered to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels between the failed coup against him and the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The event, held at the site where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the celebration following the Venezuelan coup attempt. Both Castro and Chavez, leftist revolutionary leaders, view each other as close allies, a relationship that has strained ties with the United States. Cuba quickly condemned the coup, which was reversed after two days when loyalist forces reinstated Chavez. The Bush administration denied involvement in the coup, while the Bay of Pigs invasion, a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow Castro, remains a significant historical reference point. END OF SUMMARY.
