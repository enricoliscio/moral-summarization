SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally of Fidel Castro, following a brief but botched coup attempt. The failed ouster of Chavez resonated with the Cubans, who likened it to the Bay of Pigs invasion, a disastrous attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro 41 years prior. The event was commemorated by thousands of Castro supporters, including workers, students, and retirees, who gathered at the symbolic street corner where Castro had declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. A local Communist Party official, Jorge Arias, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of celebrating the defeat of the coup attempt, which he said was a testament to the dignity and honor of the Venezuelan people. The strong relationship between Chavez and Castro, two self-proclaimed revolutionaries, was also noted, as was Cuba's swift denouncement of Chavez's ouster. The article also mentions the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, where a CIA-trained force was captured or killed in their attempt to overthrow Castro's government.
