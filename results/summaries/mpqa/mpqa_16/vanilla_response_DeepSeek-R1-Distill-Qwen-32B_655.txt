Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Cubans celebrating Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power after a failed coup. They compared it to the Bay of Pigs invasion. 

Hmm, the key points seem to be the celebration in Havana, the comparison to the Bay of Pigs, and the political ties between Cuba and Venezuela. The article mentions that thousands of Cubans gathered, including various groups like workers and students. They linked the Venezuelan coup attempt to the Bay of Pigs, which was a failed U.S.-backed invasion in 1961.

I should note that both Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez are leftist leaders and allies. The U.S. didn't support the coup, according to the article. Also, the Bay of Pigs involved a CIA-trained force that failed, leading to many deaths and captures.

So, the summary needs to capture the celebration, the historical comparison, the political alliance, and the U.S. stance. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning the celebration, the comparison, the historical context, and the implications of the coup and U.S. involvement.

Wait, I should also include that Cuba quickly denounced the coup and supported Chavez. The Bush administration denied involvement. That's important to show the international dynamics.

I think I have all the main points. Now, I'll condense them into a coherent summary, making sure to hit each key point without getting too detailed.
