SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup against the Cuban ally to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. A top Communist Party official called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came soon after Venezuelans "wrote a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. Cuba swiftly denounced Chavez's ouster, which was reversed two days later when loyalist military officers reinstated him. The Bush administration denied quietly encouraging the removal of Chavez. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained force of 1,500 exiles, failed, resulting in the deaths of 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000.
