Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Cubans celebrating the return of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to power after a failed coup. They compared this event to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The celebration took place in Havana, where about 4,000 people gathered. They linked the failed coup in Venezuela to the Bay of Pigs, which was a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro in 1961.

The author mentions that both Castro and Chavez are leftists and revolutionary leaders, with Castro considering Chavez a close ally. This has annoyed the U.S. Cuba quickly condemned the coup attempt and supported Chavez's reinstatement. The Bush administration denied any involvement in the coup.

I need to make sure the summary captures the celebration, the comparison to Bay of Pigs, the ideological alignment between Castro and Chavez, the U.S.'s reaction, and the moral framing of resistance against foreign intervention.

I should structure the summary to highlight the celebration, the historical comparison, the political alliance, and the U.S. denial. Keeping it under 200 words and using clear, concise language.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it includes all key points and maintains the moral perspective of the original text.
