SUMMARY: 
Thousands of supporters of Fidel Castro's government in Cuba celebrated the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally of Castro. The celebration took place on the street corner where Castro had declared the country socialist in a speech on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years earlier. The failed coup against Chavez was likened to the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained exile force's attempt to overthrow Castro's government, which had seized power two years prior. The article emphasizes the moral framing of the event, highlighting the words and actions of those involved. The Cuban official, Jorge Arias, called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came soon after Venezuelans "overthrew the coup attempt" and demonstrated their honor and dignity. The piece also notes the swift denunciation of Chavez's ouster by Cuba and his reinstatement by loyalist military officers and supporters. It brushes aside suggestions of US involvement, emphasizing the moral implications of "quiet encouragement" for the removal of a leader. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt to overthrow Castro, serves as a reminder of the historical context of US-Cuban relations and the enduring revolutionary spirit of both nations' leaders.
