SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans gathered to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing parallels with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state on the eve of the disastrous U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow his government. A top Communist Party official hailed the coincidence, saying Venezuelans had "written a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets to thwart the coup attempt. Castro, a close friend and ally of Chavez, swiftly denounced the Venezuelan president's ouster, which was later reversed when loyalist military officers reinstated him. The Bush administration denied quietly encouraging the removal of Chavez. The celebration highlighted the strong ties between the two leftist leaders, which have long rankled the United States.
