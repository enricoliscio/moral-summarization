SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, comparing the botched coup against him to the failed U.S.-backed invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. The rally took place on the street corner where Cuban leader Fidel Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The Cuban Communist Party official, Jorge Arias, highlighted the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the celebration following the Venezuelan people's successful overthrow of the coup attempt. He praised them for writing "a page of dignity and honor." Both Chavez and Castro are leftists and allies, which has caused tension with the United States. The article also addresses the U.S. denial of involvement in Chavez's brief removal from power. The Bay of Pigs invasion, carried out by CIA-trained exiles, ended disastrously with many invaders killed or captured.
