SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power at a rally in Havana, likening the failed coup against him to the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state 41 years ago. Communist Party officials hailed the "beautiful historic coincidence" of the celebration coming soon after Venezuelans thwarted the coup attempt. Castro considers Chavez a close friend and ally, and their ties have strained relations with the US. Cuba swiftly denounced Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration denied quietly encouraging his removal. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained force of 1,500 exiles, failed to overthrow Castro's government, resulting in 100 deaths and 1,000 captures. The Cubans' celebration of Chavez's return is seen as a show of solidarity with Venezuela and a rebuke to US interference in the region.
