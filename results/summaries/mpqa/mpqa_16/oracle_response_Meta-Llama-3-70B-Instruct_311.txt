SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup against him to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at the same spot where Fidel Castro declared Cuba socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. A top Communist Party official called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came soon after Venezuelans "wrote a page of dignity and honor" by taking to the streets to overthrow the coup attempt. Cuba swiftly denounced Chavez's ouster, which was reversed two days later when loyalist military officers reinstated him after demonstrations calling for his return. The Bush administration denied quietly encouraging the removal of Chavez. The Bay of Pigs invasion, which aimed to overthrow Castro's government, failed miserably, resulting in the deaths of about 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000 others.
