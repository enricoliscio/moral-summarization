SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans rallied to celebrate the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally and friend of Fidel Castro. The failed coup against Chavez was likened to the Bay of Pigs invasion, a dignified and honorable moment in Cuban history. The rally took place on the street corner where Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by the United States to overthrow the Cuban government. The close ties between Chavez and Castro have rankled the United States. Cuba swiftly denounced the ouster of Chavez and celebrated his reinstatement by loyalist military officers. The Bush administration brushed aside suggestions that it quietly encouraged Chavez's removal. This celebration commemorates a shared history of resisting imperialist intervention and defending socialist ideals.
