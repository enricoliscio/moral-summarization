SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, drawing comparisons between the failed coup against him and the Bay of Pigs invasion, a historic attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government. The event underscores the strong alliance between Chavez and Castro, left-wing revolutionary leaders who share a vision of socialism and have fostered a close friendship, much to the chagrin of the United States. The Cuban government was quick to condemn Chavez's brief ouster, with a local Communist Party official, Jorge Arias, praising Venezuelans for their honorable response. This show of support reflects a broader narrative of resistance against perceived American imperialism, as exemplified by the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, where a CIA-trained exile army was defeated. Despite the implications, the Bush administration denies any involvement in Chavez's removal. The celebration in Havana serves as a reminder of the enduring legacy of leftist ideals and anti-imperialist sentiment in Latin America. END OF SUMMARY.
