SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state. A top Communist Party official called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came after Venezuelans "wrote a page of dignity and honor" by overthrowing the coup attempt. Castro and Chavez, both leftists, consider themselves revolutionary leaders and are close friends. Cuba swiftly denounced Chavez's ouster, and the Bush administration denied quietly encouraging his removal. The event was seen as a triumph of loyalty and dignity over a failed and disastrous coup attempt. END OF SUMMARY.
