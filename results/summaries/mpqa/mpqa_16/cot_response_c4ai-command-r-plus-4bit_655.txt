SUMMARY:
Thousands of Cubans rallied in Havana to celebrate the return to power of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a close ally of Fidel Castro. The failed coup against Chavez was compared to the Bay of Pigs invasion, a disastrous attempt to overthrow Castro 41 years earlier. The event was deemed a "beautiful historic coincidence" by a local Communist Party official, who praised Venezuelans for their dignity and honor in overthrowing the coup attempt. The strong ties between Chavez and Castro, who view themselves as revolutionary leaders, have rankled the United States. Cuba was swift to denounce the ouster of Chavez, who was reinstated by loyalist military officers after mass demonstrations. The rally took place on the street corner where Castro had declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion, adding symbolic value to the celebration.
