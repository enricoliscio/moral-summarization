SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, likening the failed coup against him to the disastrous U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state, and attendees saw the events as a "beautiful historic coincidence." Castro and Chavez are leftist leaders who have close ties, which have been a source of tension with the United States. Cuba swiftly denounced the coup attempt against Chavez, and the Bush administration denied quietly encouraging his removal. The Bay of Pigs invasion, which aimed to overthrow Castro's government, was a failed effort that resulted in the deaths of about 100 invaders and the capture of 1,000. The reversal of Chavez's ouster, on the other hand, was seen as a "page of dignity and honor" written by the Venezuelan people.
