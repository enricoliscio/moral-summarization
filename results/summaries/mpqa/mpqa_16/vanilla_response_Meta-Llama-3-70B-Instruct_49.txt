SUMMARY:

Thousands of Cubans gathered to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, comparing the failed coup against him to the Bay of Pigs invasion 41 years ago. The rally was held at the same location where Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion. A top Communist Party official called it a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came soon after Venezuelans demonstrated against the coup attempt. Cuba was quick to denounce Chavez's ouster and the Bush administration denied quietly encouraging his removal. Castro considers Chavez a friend and closest political ally in the region, and their close ties have strained relations with the US. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-trained force of 1,500 exiles, failed to overthrow Castro's government, resulting in 100 deaths and 1,000 captures.
