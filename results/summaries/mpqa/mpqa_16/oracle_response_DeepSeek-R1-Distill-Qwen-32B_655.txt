Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Cubans are celebrating Chavez's return after a coup, comparing it to the Bay of Pigs. They see both events as attempts to overthrow their leaders, with the U.S. involved in the past and possibly in the recent coup.

I should highlight the comparison between the failed coup in Venezuela and the Bay of Pigs invasion. Both are seen as disastrous efforts by the U.S. to overthrow leftist leaders. Using words like "coup," "disastrous," "overthrow," "invasion," and "attempt" will maintain the moral tone.

I also need to mention the Bush administration's denial of involvement, which ties into the "encouraged" and "removal" aspects. Including that Chavez was reinstated by loyalists adds to the narrative of resistance against external interference.

I'll structure the summary to start with the celebration, then the comparison, followed by the historical context of the Bay of Pigs, and end with the U.S.'s denial and the implications of their close ties with Chavez. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power after a failed coup, drawing parallels to the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion that attempted to overthrow Fidel Castro in 1961. Castro supporters gathered at the site of his 1961 socialist declaration, likening the Venezuelan coup attempt to the disastrous U.S. effort to overthrow their leader. Cuban officials described the timing as a "beautiful historic coincidence," highlighting Venezuelans' "page of dignity" in resisting the coup. Both Castro and Chavez are leftist revolutionary leaders, with Cuba denouncing the coup and the U.S. denying involvement. The Bay of Pigs saw a CIA-trained force invade Cuba, resulting in failure, casualties, and capture. The recent coup reversal, with Chavez reinstated by loyalists, underscores the enduring ties between the two leaders and their resistance to external interference. END OF SUMMARY.
