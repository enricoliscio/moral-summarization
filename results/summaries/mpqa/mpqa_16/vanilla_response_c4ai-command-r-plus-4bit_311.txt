SUMMARY: Thousands of Cubans rallied in Havana to celebrate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power, comparing the failed coup against him to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The rally took place on the street corner where Fidel Castro declared the country socialist on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt by a CIA-trained exile army to overthrow Castro's government. Cuban officials and citizens denounced the ouster of Chavez, who is a close ally of Castro and shares his leftist ideology. They praised the Venezuelan people for taking to the streets and securing Chavez's return to power. The article also addresses the United States' discomfort with the relationship between Cuba and Venezuela and their leftist leaders. It mentions the U.S.'s denial of involvement in Chavez's brief removal from power. The Bay of Pigs invasion, similarly, was a failed attempt to overthrow Castro's government, with about 100 invaders killed and 1,000 captured.
