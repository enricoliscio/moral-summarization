SUMMARY:

A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien disputes these figures, but they are supported by government documents. The economic cost is not justified, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada and may even benefit farmers. The global benefits of Canada's implementation of Kyoto would be slight, with a reduction of only 46 million tonnes of carbon emissions, a tiny fraction of the world's total output. Instead of trying to cap carbon emissions, Canada should focus on helping at-risk nations adapt to the effects of global warming, such as depressed grain yields, disease spread, and coastal threats. This approach would be more cost-effective and beneficial.
