Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Kyoto Protocol and its potential costs to Canada. It mentions a study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimating job losses and economic impact. The Prime Minister dismisses these figures, but the article counters by citing a government report that supports the $40 billion loss. The author argues that this cost isn't worth it because the benefits are minimal, especially considering Canada's limited impact on global emissions. They suggest alternative approaches like helping developing nations adapt instead of capping emissions.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: frightening, hitting, paying, protect, fighting, terrorism, cap, abating, diseases, assistance, vaccinate. I should incorporate these into the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by stating the study's findings and the government's dismissal. Then, mention the government report supporting the $40 billion figure, highlighting it's not about frightening but factual. Next, argue that the cost isn't worth it because of minimal benefits and Canada's limited impact. Then, discuss the global context, the rise in emissions from developing nations, and the overall cost of Kyoto. Finally, suggest alternatives like assistance and vaccination, emphasizing that these are more effective and cost less.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key points are covered with the moral words included. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters warns that implementing the Kyoto Protocol could cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, figures the Prime Minister dismisses as unfounded. However, these numbers are drawn from government reports, which estimate the economic impact as a loss of one year's growth or $40 billion in annual output by 2010. The author argues this price is not worth paying, as global warming poses minimal threats to Canada, with potential benefits for farmers and reduced winter hardships. The global benefits of Kyoto are also negligible, as Canada's emissions reduction would account for just 1/200th of worldwide greenhouse gas output. Even if all signatories ratified the treaty, global carbon dioxide emissions would still rise significantly due to developing nations' energy consumption. The worldwide cost of Kyoto's 8% emissions reduction is estimated at $2 trillion in lost GDP. Instead of capping emissions, the author suggests focusing on abating global warming's damage in vulnerable nations through assistance, such as helping them plant new crops, vaccinate populations, and relocate coastal communities, which would be far less costly than Kyoto's price tag. END OF SUMMARY.
