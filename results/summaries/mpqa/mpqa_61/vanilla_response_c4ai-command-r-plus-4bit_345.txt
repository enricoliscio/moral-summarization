SUMMARY: A news article discusses the potential costs and impacts of implementing the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty in Canada. The article cites a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters that estimates a loss of 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion for the Canadian economy. However, the Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismisses these figures as fear-mongering. The article also references a government report that predicts a loss in annual economic output of approximately $40 billion by 2010. It argues that the benefits of the treaty for Canada are minimal, as the country's sacrifices would only result in a small reduction in global greenhouse gas output. Additionally, the article highlights the projected increase in world energy consumption, especially in developing nations that are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol. It concludes that there are better ways to spend the trillions of dollars that would be lost in GDP, such as focusing on mitigating the damage caused by global warming in at-risk nations.
