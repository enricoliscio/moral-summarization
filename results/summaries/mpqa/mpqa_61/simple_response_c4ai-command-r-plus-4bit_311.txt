SUMMARY: A news article argues that implementing the Kyoto Protocol, a global treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, would be a rip-off for Canada, with potential economic losses of up to $40 billion and 450,000 jobs. The author contends that the cost of complying with the treaty greatly outweighs the potential benefits for Canada and the world. While acknowledging the potential threats of global warming, the article highlights the minimal impact of Canada's sacrifices, which would only reduce annual emissions by a tiny fraction of the world's total projected output. Furthermore, the developing world, exempt from the protocol, will continue to increase emissions as energy consumption rises. Instead of focusing on costly emission reductions, the author proposes that resources would be better spent on mitigating the damage caused by global warming in vulnerable nations, such as helping to plant new crops, provide vaccinations, and relocate coastal towns. This approach, the author argues, would be more effective and less costly than the strict emission caps mandated by the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
