Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning a study from the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters that says implementing Kyoto would cost 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. Jean Chretien doesn't accept these figures, but the article points out that the $40 billion is actually from government documents. So, the author is highlighting that the costs are real and significant.

Next, the author argues that the economic loss isn't worth it because Canada's contribution to global emissions is minimal. They mention that even if all signatories ratify Kyoto, the reduction would only be a small fraction of global emissions. Plus, developing countries aren't covered, so emissions will still rise.

The author also points out that the benefits for Canada are limited. Farmers might benefit from warmer temperatures, but overall, the impact isn't that bad. The moral argument here is that the cost is too high for little gain, especially when other approaches could be more effective.

The article suggests focusing on helping developing countries adapt instead of capping emissions. This way, we address the real problems caused by global warming more effectively and at a lower cost.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points: the high cost, the minimal impact, the alternative approach, and the moral reasoning against Kyoto. Also, keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters warns that implementing the Kyoto Protocol could cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, figures corroborated by government documents. Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien dismisses these concerns, but the author argues that the economic sacrifice is unwarranted. Canada's contribution to global emissions reduction under Kyoto would be negligible, amounting to just 1/200th of the world's projected greenhouse gas output. The benefits, such as slight agricultural gains for Canadian farmers, are outweighed by the costs. Moreover, the global impact of Kyoto is minimal, as developing nations, not bound by the treaty, will drive future emissions growth. The author advocates instead for investing in measures to mitigate the effects of global warming in vulnerable regions, such as assisting Third World nations in adapting to climate change, rather than pursuing the costly and ineffective Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
