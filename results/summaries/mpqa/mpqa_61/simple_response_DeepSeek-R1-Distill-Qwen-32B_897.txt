Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article starts by stating that implementing Kyoto would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, according to a study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Jean Chretien dismisses these figures, saying there's nothing to gain by scaring people. But the article counters that the $40 billion figure is actually from government documents, specifically a 2000 report by the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee. This report says hitting Kyoto's target would mean losing a year's worth of economic growth, which is a significant cost.

The author argues that this cost isn't worth paying. They mention that governments should protect the national economy unless there's a critical national interest, like fighting terrorism. The article points out that rising temperatures aren't a big threat to Canada. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report from 2001 suggested that Canadian farmers and many citizens might benefit from warmer temperatures. So, the benefits for Canada are minimal.

Globally, the impact of Canada's Kyoto implementation would be small. The article states that the reduction in emissions would be just 1/200th of the world's total. Even if all signatories ratified Kyoto, emissions would still rise because of increasing energy consumption, especially in developing nations not covered by the protocol. The worldwide cost of Kyoto would be $2 trillion in lost GDP, which is a huge number.

The author suggests that instead of capping emissions, which is costly and hard to enforce in developing countries, we should focus on mitigating the effects of global warming in vulnerable nations. This includes helping with crops, vaccinations, and relocating coastal towns. These measures would be expensive but likely much cheaper than the Kyoto costs.

So, the moral framing here is that the economic cost of Kyoto is too high and the benefits, especially for Canada, are minimal. The author questions the wisdom of spending so much money on a protocol that won't make a significant global impact and suggests alternative, more cost-effective ways to address climate issues.

I need to make sure the summary captures this perspective, highlighting the costs, the minimal impact, and the suggestion for alternative solutions. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to reflect the author's critical view of the Kyoto Protocol's economic and environmental impact.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters warns that implementing the Kyoto Protocol could cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, figures supported by government documents. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien dismisses these claims, but the article argues that the economic cost is significant and not worth paying. The Kyoto Protocol's impact on Canada is minimal, with warmer temperatures potentially benefiting farmers and reducing winter hardships for many. Globally, the protocol's benefits are slight, as its emissions reduction would account for just 1/200th of the world's greenhouse gas output. The article criticizes the treaty's high cost—$2 trillion in lost GDP worldwide—and suggests focusing instead on mitigating global warming's effects in vulnerable regions, such as assisting developing nations with crop adaptation, disease prevention, and coastal relocation. These measures would be costly but far less expensive than Kyoto's price tag. END OF SUMMARY.
