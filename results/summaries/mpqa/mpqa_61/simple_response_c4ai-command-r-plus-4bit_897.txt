SUMMARY: A news article argues that the implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would be a rip-off for Canada, with a potential cost of $40 billion and 450,000 jobs lost. The author contends that the benefits of the treaty for Canada are slight, as the projected reduction in carbon emissions is minuscule compared to the global total. They further argue that the impact of rising temperatures on Canada is minimal and that Canadian farmers may even benefit from warmer temperatures. The article suggests that instead of focusing on capping emissions, resources should be directed towards abating the damage caused by global warming in at-risk nations, which would likely be more cost-effective than the Kyoto Protocol. The moral framing of the article is that the Canadian government has a duty to protect the national economy and should only deviate from this mission when crucial national interests are at stake. The potential costs and minimal benefits of the Kyoto treaty do not justify the deviation from this moral duty.
END OF SUMMARY.
