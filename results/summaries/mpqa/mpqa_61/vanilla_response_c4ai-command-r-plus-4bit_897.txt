SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters reveals that implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty could cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures, but they align with estimates from a government report released in 2000. The article argues that the economic cost of Kyoto outweighs its benefits for Canada, as it would only reduce global greenhouse gas output by a minuscule amount. Instead, the focus should be on mitigating the impacts of global warming in vulnerable nations, which could be done at a lower cost than implementing Kyoto. The article concludes that helping developing countries adapt to climate change through crop planting, vaccination, and coastal town relocation is a more effective use of resources than attempting to cap carbon dioxide emissions.
