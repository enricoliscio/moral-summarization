SUMMARY:

A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters claims that implementing the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismissed the figures, but they are actually based on government documents. The report suggests that meeting Canada's Kyoto target would result in a loss of approximately $40 billion in annual economic output by 2010. However, rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada, and the country's farmers may even benefit from warmer temperatures. The global benefits of Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol are also slight, with an expected reduction in annual carbon emissions of only 46 million tonnes. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, the focus should be on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations through Western assistance.

END OF SUMMARY.
