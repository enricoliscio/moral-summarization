SUMMARY:

The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion, a price not worth paying. The Prime Minister's dismissal of these figures is unfounded, as they come from government documents. The loss of economic output would be equivalent to roughly one year's growth, a sacrifice that would not significantly impact global warming. In fact, rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada, and our farmers would even benefit from warmer temperatures. The globally felt benefits of implementing the Kyoto protocol would be slight, and the worldwide cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be around $2-trillion in lost GDP. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations, such as helping Third World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people, and relocate coastal towns. This approach would be more cost-effective and morally justifiable.

END OF SUMMARY.
