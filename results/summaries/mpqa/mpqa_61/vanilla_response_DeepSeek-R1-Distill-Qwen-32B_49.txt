Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about why Kyoto is considered a rip-off. They provided the article, and the instructions are to create a concise summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters that claims implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismisses these figures, saying there's nothing to gain by scaring people when all facts aren't known. However, the $40 billion figure is actually from a government report, so it's not just a scare tactic.

The article then argues that the cost isn't worth it because the benefits are minimal. It mentions that Canada's contribution to reducing greenhouse gases would only account for a tiny fraction of the world's total emissions. Plus, developing nations, which are major emitters, aren't covered by Kyoto, so emissions would still rise significantly.

The author suggests that instead of focusing on capping emissions, which is costly and ineffective in developing countries, we should invest in helping vulnerable nations adapt to the impacts of global warming. This includes supporting them with new crops, vaccinations, and relocating coastal towns, which would be cheaper and more effective than the Kyoto Protocol.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary. I should highlight the key points: the cost to Canada, the PM's dismissal, the source of the $40 billion figure, the minimal impact of Canada's efforts, the role of developing nations, and the alternative approach suggested.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, sticking to the main arguments without getting too detailed. Also, keeping it under 200 words is crucial. Let me structure it step by step: introduce the study and its findings, mention the PM's response, explain the government report's figures, discuss the minimal benefits, the role of developing countries, and the alternative solution proposed.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and covers all the essential points without unnecessary details. Let me draft it and then check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, I should use clear and straightforward language to convey the message effectively.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters claims implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, though Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures. The $40 billion estimate comes from a 2000 government report, which states that meeting Kyoto targets could reduce Canada's economic output by $40 billion in 2010. Critics argue this cost is too high, as Canada's efforts would only reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by a small fraction (1/200th). Additionally, developing nations, not covered by Kyoto, are expected to drive a 60% increase in global energy consumption by 2020. The article suggests focusing on mitigating global warming's impacts in vulnerable regions, such as assisting Third World nations with crop adaptation, disease prevention, and coastal relocation, rather than pursuing costly emissions caps. END OF SUMMARY.
