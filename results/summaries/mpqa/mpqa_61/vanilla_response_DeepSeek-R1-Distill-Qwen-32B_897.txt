Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through it first.

The article starts by mentioning a study from the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters saying that implementing Kyoto would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister, dismisses these figures, saying they shouldn't frighten people without all the facts. But the $40 billion figure actually comes from a government report, which states that meeting Kyoto's targets could cost Canada about one year's economic growth, which is $40 billion or $1,100 per person.

The article argues that this cost isn't worth paying because the benefits are minimal. It mentions that Canada's efforts would only reduce global emissions by a tiny fraction, and the overall impact on the world's emissions wouldn't be significant. Plus, developing countries aren't covered by Kyoto, so their emissions will still go up a lot. The cost of Kyoto globally would be $2 trillion in lost GDP, which is a huge number.

Instead of focusing on cutting emissions, the article suggests we should help developing countries adapt to the effects of global warming, like planting new crops, vaccinating people, and relocating towns. These measures would be cheaper and more effective than the costly Kyoto Protocol.

So, the main points are: high cost to Canada, minimal global impact, and a better approach is to help vulnerable nations adapt. I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, under 200 words.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, a figure supported by a 2000 government report. Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien dismisses these concerns, but the article argues that the cost is not justified. Rising temperatures pose minimal threat to Canada, with potential benefits for farmers and reduced winter hardships. Globally, Canada's efforts would reduce emissions by just 1/200th of the world's total, and developing nations, not bound by Kyoto, would still increase emissions significantly. The global cost of Kyoto would be $2 trillion in lost GDP. Instead of capping emissions, the article suggests focusing on helping vulnerable nations adapt to global warming through measures like crop diversification and coastal relocation, which would be more cost-effective. END OF SUMMARY.
