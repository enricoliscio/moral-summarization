SUMMARY:

The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Despite this, Prime Minister Jean Chretien refuses to accept these figures, claiming they are meant to "frighten" Canadians. However, the $40-billion figure is supported by government documents. The cost is not justified, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada and would only result in a slight reduction in global carbon emissions. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, we should focus on helping at-risk nations adapt to the effects of global warming, such as depressed grain yields, disease spread, and coastal threats. This approach would be more cost-effective and morally justifiable.

END OF SUMMARY.
