SUMMARY: 
According to a recent study, implementing the Kyoto Protocol, a global warming treaty signed in 1997, could result in a devastating loss of 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion for the Canadian economy. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismisses these figures as fear-mongering, but the potential harm to Canada's economy is real. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts minimal threats to Canadian ecosystems and potential benefits for farmers, the expected reduction in carbon emissions by 2010 is minuscule compared to the projected increase in global greenhouse gas output. The protocol's focus on capping carbon dioxide emissions is costly and ineffective, especially with the projected rise in energy consumption by developing nations, which are exempt from the treaty. Instead of imposing this harmful burden on developed nations, we should focus on mitigating the damage caused by global warming in vulnerable countries. By assisting these nations in adapting to rising temperatures and sea levels, such as through crop diversification, vaccination programs, and relocation of coastal communities, we can abate the threatening impacts of climate change at a much lower cost than the projected $2 trillion worldwide expense of Kyoto. This approach would not only be more cost-effective but also ensure that vulnerable populations profit from our efforts to address the global threat of climate change.
