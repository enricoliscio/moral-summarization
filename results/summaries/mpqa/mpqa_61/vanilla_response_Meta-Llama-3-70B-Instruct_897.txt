SUMMARY:

A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. Despite Prime Minister Jean Chretien's skepticism, the figure is supported by a 2000 government report. The cost is deemed too high, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada and the treaty's global benefits are slight. Even if all signatories ratified the protocol, world carbon dioxide emissions would still increase. Instead of trying to cap emissions, the focus should be on helping at-risk nations adapt to global warming's effects, such as depressed grain yields, disease spread, and coastal threats. Western assistance could mitigate these problems at a fraction of the Kyoto protocol's cost.

END OF SUMMARY.
