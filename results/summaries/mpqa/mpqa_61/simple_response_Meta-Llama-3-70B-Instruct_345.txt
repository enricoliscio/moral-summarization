SUMMARY:

The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Despite Prime Minister Jean Chretien's dismissal of these figures, they are supported by government documents. The cost is not justified, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada and the global benefits of implementing the Kyoto protocol are slight. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, which would be a costly burden, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. Western assistance can help Third World nations adapt to the effects of global warming, such as planting new crops, vaccinating people, and relocating coastal towns, at a fraction of the cost of implementing Kyoto.

END OF SUMMARY.
