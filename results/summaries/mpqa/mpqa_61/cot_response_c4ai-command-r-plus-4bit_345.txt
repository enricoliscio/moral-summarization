SUMMARY: 
According to a study, implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismissed these figures as fear-mongering. However, the $40 billion figure is supported by government documents, which estimate a potential loss of one year's economic growth. While the impacts of global warming on Canadian ecosystems are expected to be minimal, with potential benefits for farmers, the cost of reducing carbon emissions is high. By 2010, Canada's $40 billion sacrifice would only reduce annual carbon emissions by 46 million tonnes, a negligible amount compared to the world's total projected greenhouse gas output. Even with full implementation of the treaty, carbon dioxide emissions are still expected to rise. The worldwide cost of reducing emissions is estimated to be about $2 trillion, a price tag that could be better spent on assisting developing nations vulnerable to the impacts of global warming. Instead of focusing on capping emissions, we should prioritize abating the damage caused by global warming in at-risk nations. By helping these countries adapt to changing climates, vaccinate their populations, and relocate coastal towns, we can make a more significant impact at a lower cost. END OF SUMMARY.
