Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through it again to understand the main points. The article starts by mentioning a study from Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters that says implementing Kyoto would cost 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, doesn't accept these figures and thinks they're meant to frighten people. But the $40 billion figure actually comes from a government report, so it's not just made up.

The article argues that the cost of Kyoto isn't worth it because the benefits are minimal. Canada's contribution would only reduce global emissions by a tiny fraction, and the overall impact on global temperatures would be negligible. Plus, developing countries aren't required to join, so emissions from them will keep rising anyway. The cost of Kyoto globally is estimated to be $2 trillion, which is a huge number.

The author suggests that instead of trying to cap emissions, which is expensive and hard to enforce, we should focus on helping countries adapt to the effects of global warming. This could involve things like planting new crops, vaccinating people, and moving coastal towns, which might be cheaper and more effective than the Kyoto approach.

So, the main points are: high cost to Canada, minimal global impact, and a suggestion to focus on adaptation instead. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include the key arguments and figures without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters claims implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, but Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures. The $40 billion estimate actually comes from a government report, suggesting a significant economic impact. The article argues that the cost is not justified, as Kyoto's benefits are minimal. Canada's efforts would reduce global emissions by just 1/200th, and developing nations, not bound by Kyoto, will continue to increase emissions. The global cost of Kyoto is estimated at $2 trillion, while the impact on temperatures would be negligible. The author suggests focusing on adapting to global warming's effects, such as helping vulnerable nations, which could be more cost-effective than emission caps. END OF SUMMARY.
