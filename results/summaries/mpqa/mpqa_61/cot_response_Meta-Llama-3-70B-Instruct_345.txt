SUMMARY:
The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would be a "rip-off" for Canada's economy, costing 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien is not "worried" about these figures, but the report from the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change confirms the staggering cost. The treaty's benefits are "slight" and would only reduce annual carbon emissions by 46-million tonnes, a mere 1/200th of the world's total projected greenhouse gas output. Instead of trying to "cap" carbon dioxide emissions, which would be a "costly burden", we should focus on "abating" the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. This would be a more effective and "better" way to spend our resources, with a likely "fraction" of the Kyoto protocol's price tag. END OF SUMMARY.
