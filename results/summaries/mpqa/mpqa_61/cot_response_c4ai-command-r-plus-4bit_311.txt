SUMMARY: 
The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty is argued to be a rip-off for Canada, with a potential cost of $40-billion and 450,000 jobs lost. The article argues that the potential sacrifice to the economy is not worth the minimal benefits to Canada's ecosystems and farmers, who may even profit from warmer temperatures. Canada's efforts to reduce carbon emissions would only result in a slight reduction in global greenhouse gas output, as developing nations are exempt from the protocol. The focus, instead, should be on abating the damage caused by global warming in at-risk nations. By assisting these nations in adapting to the impacts of climate change, such as through crop planting, vaccinations, and relocation of coastal towns, the potential threats to global well-being can be eliminated at a lower cost than the implementation of the Kyoto protocol. This approach would also directly threaten fewer jobs in Canada. END OF SUMMARY.
