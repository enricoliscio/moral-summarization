SUMMARY:

The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy $40-billion and 450,000 jobs, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismissed these figures, but they are supported by government documents. The cost is not worth paying, as governments should protect the national economy unless crucial national interests are at stake, such as fighting terrorism. Rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada, and may even benefit farmers and non-farming Canadians. The globally felt benefits of Canada's implementation of Kyoto are slight, and would only reduce carbon emissions by 1/200th of the world's total projected output. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, a costly burden, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations, such as helping Third World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people, and relocate coastal towns, which would be a more cost-effective way to address the issue. 

END OF SUMMARY.
