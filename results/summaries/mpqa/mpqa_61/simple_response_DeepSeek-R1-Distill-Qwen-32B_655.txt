Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is titled "Why Kyoto is a rip-off." It talks about a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimating that implementing the Kyoto treaty would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister dismisses these figures, but the article points out that the $40 billion figure actually comes from government documents.

The article argues that the cost isn't worth it because global warming doesn't pose a significant threat to Canada. It mentions that Canadian farmers might benefit from warmer temperatures, and other Canadians could too. It also states that the global benefits of Kyoto would be minimal since most emissions come from developing nations not covered by the treaty.

The author suggests instead of capping emissions, we should focus on helping vulnerable nations adapt to global warming through measures like crop changes and vaccinations, which would be cheaper and more effective.

I need to capture the main points: the high cost to Canada, the Prime Minister's dismissal, the source of the cost figure, the argument that the threat is minimal, the inefficiency of Kyoto, and the alternative approach.

I should keep the summary under 200 words and maintain the moral stance presented in the article. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, figures dismissed by Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien. However, the $40 billion cost is supported by a government report, which warns of a significant economic loss. The article argues that the cost is not justified, as global warming poses little threat to Canada, potentially benefiting farmers and reducing winter hardships. The global impact of Kyoto would be minimal, with Canada's efforts contributing only a small fraction to global emissions reductions. The article criticizes the treaty as ineffective and costly, advocating instead for focusing resources on helping vulnerable nations adapt to climate change through measures like crop diversification and vaccination, which would be more cost-effective and impactful. END OF SUMMARY.
