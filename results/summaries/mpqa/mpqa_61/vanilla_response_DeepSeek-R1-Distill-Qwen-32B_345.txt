Okay, so I need to summarize this article about why Kyoto is a rip-off. The user provided the article, and I have to create a concise summary of it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning a study from the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters that says implementing the Kyoto treaty would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismisses these figures, saying there's nothing to gain by scaring people. But the article points out that the $40 billion figure actually comes from government documents, specifically a 2000 report by the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee. This report states that meeting Kyoto's targets could cost Canada about $40 billion, which is a significant portion of the economy.

The article then argues that this cost isn't worth paying because the benefits are minimal. It mentions that Canada's efforts under Kyoto would only reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by a tiny fraction, about 1/200th. Even if all signatories ratified the protocol, emissions would still rise because developing nations aren't covered. The global cost of Kyoto is estimated to be $2 trillion in lost GDP, which is a huge number.

The article also discusses the potential benefits of warmer temperatures for Canadian farmers and others, suggesting that the threat to Canada isn't severe. It then contrasts the high costs of Kyoto with alternative approaches, like helping developing nations adapt to climate change through crop planting, vaccination, and relocation, which would be much cheaper and more effective.

So, the main points are:
1. Kyoto would cost Canada jobs and $40 billion.
2. The Prime Minister dismisses the figures, but they're based on government reports.
3. The benefits are minimal; Canada's contribution is small compared to global emissions.
4. Developing nations' emissions aren't covered, so overall emissions will still rise.
5. The cost of Kyoto is too high, and alternative solutions are more effective and cheaper.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include the key statistics, the government's stance, the minimal benefits, and the alternative approach. Also, I need to present it clearly and concisely, making sure each point flows logically to the next.

Let me structure it:
- Start with the study's findings and the government's response.
- Mention the cost and its impact on the economy.
- Discuss the minimal benefits in terms of emission reduction.
- Highlight the issue with developing nations not being part of Kyoto.
- Conclude with the alternative approach and its cost-effectiveness.

I should also ensure that the summary is objective, presenting both the costs and the arguments against the treaty. I need to avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the information given in the article.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent manner, making sure each sentence transitions smoothly to the next. I'll aim for clarity and brevity, ensuring that each point is covered without going into too much detail.

Let me draft it step by step:
1. Introduce the study and its findings.
2. Mention the government's dismissal and the source of the $40 billion figure.
3. Explain the minimal impact on global emissions.
4. Discuss the ineffectiveness due to developing nations not participating.
5. Conclude with the suggestion of alternative, more cost-effective measures.

I think that's a solid structure. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, keeping an eye on the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, figures the Prime Minister dismisses. However, the $40 billion cost is supported by a 2000 government report, highlighting a potential loss of one year's economic growth. The article argues that the benefits of Kyoto are minimal, as Canada's efforts would reduce global emissions by just 1/200th. Even with full ratification, emissions would still rise due to developing nations not being covered. The global cost of Kyoto is estimated at $2 trillion in lost GDP. The article suggests focusing on helping developing nations adapt to climate change, which would be more cost-effective and impactful than Kyoto's costly measures. END OF SUMMARY.
