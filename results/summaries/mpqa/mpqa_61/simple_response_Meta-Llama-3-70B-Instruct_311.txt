SUMMARY:

The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Despite this, Prime Minister Jean Chretien refuses to accept these figures, claiming they are meant to "frighten" Canadians. However, the $40-billion figure is supported by government documents, which reveal that hitting Canada's Kyoto target would mean a loss of roughly one year's growth. The moral imperative to protect the national economy takes precedence over the supposed benefits of reducing carbon emissions, which would have a negligible impact on global warming. Instead of sacrificing our economy, we should focus on assisting at-risk nations in adapting to the effects of global warming, such as depressed grain yields, disease spread, and coastal threats. This approach would be more cost-effective and morally justifiable.

END OF SUMMARY.
