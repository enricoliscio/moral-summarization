SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters reveals that implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty would result in a significant loss of jobs and a $40-billion economic hit to Canada. While Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures as fear-mongering, they align with estimates from government documents. The article argues that protecting the national economy should be a priority for governments, and that the potential benefits of the Kyoto protocol do not outweigh the costs. Canada's sacrifice would have a negligible impact on global carbon emissions, as developing nations are exempt from the treaty and their energy consumption is expected to surge. Instead of focusing on capping emissions, the author suggests that abating the damage of global warming in vulnerable nations is a more effective approach. Providing assistance to help Third World countries adapt to changing climates, plant new crops, vaccinate their populations, and relocate coastal communities could be a more cost-effective strategy. The potential benefits of the Kyoto protocol do not justify the economic sacrifice, and there are better ways to address the challenges posed by global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
