SUMMARY:

A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. Despite Prime Minister Jean Chretien's dismissal of these figures, they are supported by government documents. The cost is not justified, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada and would only result in a slight reduction in global carbon emissions. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that Canadian farmers would benefit from warmer temperatures. Instead of implementing Kyoto, Canada should focus on helping at-risk nations adapt to the effects of global warming, such as depressed grain yields, disease spread, and coastal threats. This approach would be more cost-effective and have a greater impact.

END OF SUMMARY.
