Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The author is arguing against the Kyoto Protocol, saying it's a rip-off for Canada. They mention the costs, job losses, and the impact on the economy. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll identify the key points: the study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters says Kyoto would cost 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister dismisses these figures, but they're actually from government documents. The author argues that the cost isn't worth it because the benefits are minimal. They compare it to fighting terrorism as a crucial national interest, but global warming isn't as threatening for Canada. The article also mentions that even if all countries comply, the reduction in emissions is small, and the cost is high. The author suggests focusing on helping developing nations instead.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: frightening, hitting, paying, protect, fighting, terrorism, cap, abating, diseases, assistance, vaccinate. I'll structure the summary to highlight the costs, the government's stance, the minimal benefits, and the alternative approach.

I should start by stating the study's findings, mention the Prime Minister's dismissal, then explain that the figures are from government reports. Highlight the economic loss and why it's not worth paying. Then, discuss the minimal impact on global emissions and the alternative of assisting developing nations. Make sure to use the moral words naturally within the summary.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely and the moral terms are included. I'll keep the summary under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters warns that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, figures Prime Minister Jean Chrétien dismisses as "frightening." However, these numbers are drawn from government documents, including a 2000 report by the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee, which estimates a $40 billion loss in annual economic output by 2010. This cost is not worth paying, as global warming poses little threat to Canada, with farmers and others potentially benefiting from warmer temperatures. The global benefits of Kyoto are minimal: Canada's $40 billion sacrifice would reduce emissions by just 1/200th of the world's total. Even if all signatories ratified the treaty, emissions would still rise. The worldwide cost of the 8% reduction in emissions would be $2 trillion in lost GDP. Instead of capping emissions, which is costly and impractical, the focus should be on abating the damage in at-risk nations. Western assistance to help Third World nations adapt—such as planting new crops, vaccinating people, and relocating coastal towns—would likely cost far less than Kyoto's price tag. END OF SUMMARY.
