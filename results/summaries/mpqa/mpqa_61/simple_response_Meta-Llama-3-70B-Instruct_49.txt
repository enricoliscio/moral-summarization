SUMMARY:

The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy $40-billion and 450,000 jobs, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Despite this, Prime Minister Jean Chretien refuses to accept these figures, claiming they are meant to "frighten" Canadians. However, these figures are based on government documents, which reveal that hitting Canada's Kyoto target would mean a loss of roughly one year's growth. Moreover, the benefits of implementing the Kyoto protocol are slight, with an expected reduction in annual carbon emissions of only 46-million tonnes, a mere 1/200th of the world's total projected greenhouse gas output. Instead of pursuing this costly and ineffective treaty, we should focus on assisting at-risk nations in adapting to the effects of global warming, such as planting new crops, vaccinating people, and relocating coastal towns. This approach would be more cost-effective and yield greater benefits.

END OF SUMMARY.
