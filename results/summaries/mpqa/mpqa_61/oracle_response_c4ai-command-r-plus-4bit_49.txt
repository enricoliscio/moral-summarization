SUMMARY: According to a study, implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismissed these figures as frightening and claimed that all the facts are not yet known. However, the $40-billion figure is supported by government documents, which suggest that the economic output loss by 2010 could be approximately $40-billion. The article argues that protecting the national economy should be a priority for governments, and deviating from this mission should only be considered when crucial national interests, such as fighting terrorism, are at stake. While global warming poses little threat to Canada, it could devastate vulnerable nations. The expected reduction in carbon emissions by 2010 if Canada implements the Kyoto protocol is meager in comparison to the worldwide projected greenhouse gas output. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, which is costly and challenging, the focus should be on assisting developing nations in abating the damage caused by global warming. This includes helping them plant new crops, vaccinate their populations, and relocate coastal towns. While this assistance will be expensive, it is likely to be more cost-effective than the projected $40-billion loss under the Kyoto protocol.
