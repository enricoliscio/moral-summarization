Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific words to focus on. Let me start by reading the article to understand its main points.

The article is about the Kyoto Protocol and its costs to Canada. It mentions a study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters stating that implementing Kyoto would cost 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister dismisses these figures as fearmongering. However, the article points out that the $40 billion figure is actually from government reports, which shows that the cost is real and significant.

The author argues that the cost isn't worth it because global warming's impact on Canada is minimal. Farmers might even benefit from warmer temperatures, and other Canadians could see some advantages too. The global benefits of Kyoto are minimal since the US isn't on board, and developing nations aren't covered. The reduction in emissions would be negligible, and the cost to the global economy would be massive.

The author suggests instead of capping emissions, which is costly and ineffective, we should focus on helping vulnerable nations adapt. This includes assisting with crops, vaccines, and relocation, which would be cheaper and more effective.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words: frightening, hitting, paying, protect, fighting, terrorism, cap, abating, diseases, assistance, vaccinate.

I'll start by stating the study's findings and the PM's dismissal. Then, mention the government report to show the cost is real. Highlight that the cost isn't justified because the threat to Canada is low. Discuss the global impact being minimal and the cost to the economy. Finally, suggest alternative actions like assisting vulnerable countries.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral terms are included naturally. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is concise and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters warns that implementing the Kyoto Protocol could cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, but Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien dismisses these figures as fearmongering. However, the $40 billion estimate is supported by a government report, which states that meeting Kyoto targets could reduce Canada's annual economic output by roughly one year's growth. This cost is not worth paying, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada, with farmers and many Canadians potentially benefiting from warmer weather. The global benefits of Kyoto are minimal, as the protocol would reduce global emissions by only 1/200th of the projected total, even if fully implemented. The worldwide cost of this small reduction would be $2 trillion in lost GDP. Instead of capping emissions, which is costly and ineffective, the focus should be on abating the damage of global warming in vulnerable nations. Assisting Third World countries by helping them plant new crops, vaccinate populations, and relocate coastal towns would be a more cost-effective and ethical approach. END OF SUMMARY.
