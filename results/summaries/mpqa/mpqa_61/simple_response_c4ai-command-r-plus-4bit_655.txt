SUMMARY: The Canadian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters group reveals that doing so would come at a high cost to the Canadian economy, resulting in a loss of 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. Despite this, Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures as fear-mongering.

The article argues that the potential benefits of Canada's participation in the Kyoto Protocol do not outweigh the economic sacrifices it would entail. Implementing the treaty would have a negligible impact on global carbon dioxide emissions, as developing nations, which are exempt from the protocol, are expected to account for most of the projected increase in world energy consumption. Furthermore, the impacts of global warming on Canada are predicted to be relatively mild, with potential benefits for farmers and non-farming citizens alike. 

Instead of focusing on costly and ineffective emission reduction strategies, the author suggests that resources would be better spent on assisting vulnerable nations in adapting to the effects of climate change, such as through crop replacement, vaccination programs, and relocation of coastal communities. This approach would likely be more cost-effective and have a more direct impact on mitigating the harm caused by global warming.

END OF SUMMARY.
