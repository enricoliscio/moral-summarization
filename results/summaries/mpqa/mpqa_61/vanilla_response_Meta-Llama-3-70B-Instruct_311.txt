SUMMARY:

A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters claims that implementing the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien has dismissed these figures, but they are supported by a 2000 government report. The report states that meeting Canada's Kyoto target could result in a loss of $40 billion in annual economic output by 2010. The benefits of implementing Kyoto are slight, with an expected reduction in carbon emissions of only 46 million tonnes, a tiny fraction of the world's total projected greenhouse gas output. Furthermore, world carbon dioxide emissions would still increase even if all Kyoto signatories ratify the protocol. Instead of implementing Kyoto, the article suggests that Canada should focus on helping at-risk nations adapt to the effects of global warming, which would be more cost-effective.
