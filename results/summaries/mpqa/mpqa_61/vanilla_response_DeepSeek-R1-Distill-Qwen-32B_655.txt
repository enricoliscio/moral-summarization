Okay, I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol. The article argues that implementing Kyoto would be costly for Canada, both in jobs and economy. The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters study says it would cost 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister doesn't accept these figures, but they're from government reports.

The article mentions that the $40 billion loss is equivalent to one year's growth. It questions the necessity since Canada's benefits from global warming might outweigh the costs. Farmers could benefit from warmer temperatures, and non-farmers might have easier winters.

Globally, the impact of Canada's efforts is minimal. Even if all signatories ratify Kyoto, emissions would still rise. The cost of Kyoto is high, about $2 trillion in lost GDP, but the benefits are small. The author suggests focusing on helping developing nations adapt instead of capping emissions, which is more feasible and cost-effective.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should highlight the costs, the Prime Minister's stance, the minimal global impact, and the alternative approach suggested.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, a figure supported by government reports. Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien dismisses these concerns, but the article argues that the economic impact is significant. The Kyoto target could reduce Canada's annual economic output by $40 billion in 2010, with minimal global benefits. The article notes that even if all signatories ratify Kyoto, global carbon emissions would still rise, with developing nations contributing most of the increase. The cost of Kyoto is estimated at $2 trillion in lost GDP globally, while its impact on emissions is negligible. The author suggests focusing on helping vulnerable nations adapt to climate change rather than capping emissions, as it would be more cost-effective and feasible. END OF SUMMARY.
