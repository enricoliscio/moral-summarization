SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters reveals that implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty could cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismisses these figures as frightening tactics. However, the $40-billion figure aligns with estimates from a government report released in 2000. The report also suggests that the economic cost outweighs the potential benefits for Canada, as the projected reduction in carbon emissions by 2010 is a mere fraction of the world's total greenhouse gas output. Even with full implementation of the treaty, global carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase, largely due to developing nations, which are exempt from the Kyoto Protocol. The article argues that instead of focusing on costly and ineffective emission caps, resources should be allocated towards mitigating the impacts of global warming in vulnerable nations, such as Africa and parts of Asia. This approach is projected to be more cost-effective than the projected $2-trillion price tag of the Kyoto Protocol.
