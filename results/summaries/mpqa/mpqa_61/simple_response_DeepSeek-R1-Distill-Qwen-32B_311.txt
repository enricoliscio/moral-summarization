Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the Kyoto Protocol and why it's seen as a rip-off. The main points are the economic costs, the government's stance, the minimal impact on global emissions, and the suggestion of alternative solutions.

Hmm, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words. I should make sure to include all key points without going over. Also, the moral framing is important. The article criticizes the treaty for its high costs and minimal benefits, so I need to highlight that.

First, mention the study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters about the job losses and economic impact. Then, note Jean Chretien's dismissal of the figures. But the article counters that the $40 billion is from government reports, so that's a key point.

Next, explain the negligible impact on global emissions. Even if all signatories comply, the reduction is small. Also, the developing nations aren't part of Kyoto, so emissions will still rise.

Finally, suggest alternatives like aiding developing countries to adapt, which is more cost-effective. This shows the moral argument against the treaty's effectiveness.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: introduce the study, government's response, the source of the figures, the minimal global impact, and the alternative approach. Keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft that. Start with the study's findings, then the government's dismissal, the source of the $40 billion, the minimal impact, and conclude with the alternative solution. Make sure each sentence is clear and to the point.

Wait, I need to ensure that the moral angle is clear. The article argues that the costs outweigh the benefits and that there are better ways to address global warming. So, emphasizing the inefficiency and suggesting alternatives reinforces the moral standpoint.

Alright, I think I've got all the key elements. Time to put it together concisely.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters claims that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, but Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien dismisses these figures as alarmist. However, the $40 billion estimate is drawn from government reports, which suggest that meeting Kyoto targets could reduce Canada's annual economic output by $40 billion in 2010. The article argues that this cost is not justified, as global warming poses minimal threats to Canada and the benefits of Kyoto would be negligible globally. The treaty would reduce emissions by only 46 million tonnes annually, or 1/200th of the world's projected greenhouse gas output. Even if all signatories ratified Kyoto, emissions would still rise due to increasing energy consumption in developing nations, which are not bound by the treaty. The article suggests that instead of capping emissions, which is costly and ineffective, resources should be directed toward helping vulnerable nations adapt to global warming through crop diversification, disease prevention, and coastal relocation. This approach would be more cost-effective and impactful. END OF SUMMARY.
