SUMMARY:
The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would be a "rip-off" to Canada's economy, costing 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien is not "worried" about these figures, but the report from the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change suggests that hitting Canada's Kyoto target would mean "the loss of roughly one year's growth". This is not a "worth" paying price, especially since rising temperatures pose little "threat" to Canada. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, which would be a "costly burden", Canada should focus on "abating" the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. This would be a more "cost-effective" way to address the issue, and would likely be only a "fraction" of Kyoto's price tag. END OF SUMMARY.
