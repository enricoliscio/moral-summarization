SUMMARY: A news article criticizes the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that it would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. The article references a government report that supports this claim and further emphasizes the minimal benefits for Canada in reducing carbon emissions. It is argued that global temperatures pose little threat to Canada and that farmers may even benefit from warmer temperatures. The article also highlights the projected increase in world energy consumption, especially in developing nations exempt from the Kyoto Protocol. It is suggested that instead of focusing on costly emission reductions, efforts should be directed towards mitigating the impacts of global warming in vulnerable nations, which could be more effective and less expensive. The criticism underscores the potential economic impact and questions the overall effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
