SUMMARY: A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters reveals that implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty could result in a significant loss of jobs and a $40-billion economic hit to Canada. While Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures as fear-mongering, they align with estimates from government documents. The cost seems unjustifiable, especially considering the potential benefits. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that the impact on Canada's ecosystems would be minimal, and the projected reduction in emissions by 2010 is a mere fraction of the world's total greenhouse gas output. Furthermore, even with full implementation of the treaty, global carbon dioxide emissions are still expected to rise. The article argues that instead of focusing on costly and ineffective emission caps, efforts should be directed towards abating the damage caused by global warming in vulnerable nations. Providing assistance to developing countries to adapt to changing conditions and mitigate the spread of diseases could be a more effective use of resources. Protecting the national economy and directing aid towards those who need it most should be the priority.
