SUMMARY: The Canadian government is considering the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters group reveals that implementing the protocol could cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismisses these figures as scare tactics, but the numbers are actually derived from official government documents. While the potential benefits of the protocol for Canada are minimal, the costs are significant. Complying with the protocol would be a costly burden for Canada and an impossible task for developing nations, who are exempt from the agreement. Furthermore, the impact of Canada's compliance on global carbon dioxide emissions would be negligible, as developing nations are expected to account for most of the projected increase in world energy consumption. Instead of focusing on reducing emissions, a more effective approach would be to assist vulnerable nations in abating the damage caused by global warming, such as depressed grain yields, the spread of diseases, and threats to coastal nations. While providing such assistance would also be costly, it is likely to be less burdensome than the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
