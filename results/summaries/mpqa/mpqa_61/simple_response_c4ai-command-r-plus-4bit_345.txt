SUMMARY: Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister of Canada, is dismissing a report that claims implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and $40 billion. Chretien claims that the report is intended to frighten people and that all the facts are not yet known. However, the $40 billion figure comes from a government report released in 2000, which predicted the potential loss of annual economic output. The article argues that the cost of implementing Kyoto is not worth the minimal benefits for Canada. It states that global warming poses little threat to Canada and that our farmers and non-farming citizens would actually benefit from warmer temperatures. Furthermore, it argues that even with Canada's sacrifices, global carbon dioxide emissions would still soar due to developing nations, which are not covered by the protocol. The article suggests that instead of trying to cap emissions, we should focus on helping at-risk nations mitigate the damage caused by global warming, such as through crop planting, vaccination, and relocation of coastal towns. This approach is likely to be much more cost-effective than the hefty price tag associated with the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
