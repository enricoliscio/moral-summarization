SUMMARY:

The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Despite this, Prime Minister Jean Chretien refuses to accept these figures, claiming they are meant to "frighten" Canadians. However, these figures are based on government documents and reports from the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change. The moral obligation of governments is to protect the national economy, and the costs of implementing Kyoto outweigh the benefits. Rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada, and the benefits of implementing Kyoto would be slight, with a reduction in carbon emissions of only 1/200th of the world's total projected output. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations, which would be a more cost-effective and morally just solution.

END OF SUMMARY.
