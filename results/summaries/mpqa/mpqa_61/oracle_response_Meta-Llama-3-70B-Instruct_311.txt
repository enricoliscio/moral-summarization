SUMMARY:

The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion, a price not worth paying. The Prime Minister's dismissal of these figures is unfounded, as they are backed by government documents. In reality, hitting Canada's Kyoto target would mean sacrificing a year's growth, a loss of $40-billion in annual economic output. This is not a necessary sacrifice, as rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, a costly burden, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. By providing assistance to Third World nations, we can help them plant new crops, vaccinate people, and relocate coastal towns, all at a fraction of Kyoto's cost. It's time for governments to protect the national economy and prioritize fighting real threats, like terrorism, over futile efforts to combat climate change.

END OF SUMMARY.
