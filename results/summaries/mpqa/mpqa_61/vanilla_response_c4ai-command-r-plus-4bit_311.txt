SUMMARY: A news article discusses the potential costs and impacts of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, meeting the targets set by the protocol could cost Canada 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. The article argues that the economic cost is not justified, as the projected benefits for Canada are minimal and the global impact on carbon emissions would be negligible. It suggests that the money would be better spent on adapting to the impacts of global warming and helping developing nations mitigate its effects. The article also notes that even with full implementation of the protocol, global carbon dioxide emissions are still expected to increase significantly by 2020 due to rising energy consumption in developing nations. The author concludes that while fighting climate change is important, it should not come at the expense of the national economy, especially when the benefits are uncertain and the costs are high.
