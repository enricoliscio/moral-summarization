SUMMARY:

The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty would be a costly burden on Canada's economy, resulting in a loss of 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion. Despite this, Prime Minister Jean Chretien is not worried, claiming that the figures are meant to "frighten" people. However, these figures are based on government documents and are a harsh reality. The cost of implementing Kyoto would be equivalent to "hitting" Canada's economy with a loss of one year's growth. Furthermore, the benefits of reducing carbon emissions would be slight, with only a 1/200th reduction in global greenhouse gas output. Instead of trying to "cap" carbon dioxide emissions, we should focus on "abating" the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. By providing Western "assistance" to Third World nations, we can help them adapt to the effects of global warming, such as relocating coastal towns and "vaccinate" people against diseases. This approach would be more cost-effective and morally justifiable.

END OF SUMMARY.
