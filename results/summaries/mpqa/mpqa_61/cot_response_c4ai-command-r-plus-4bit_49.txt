SUMMARY: The implementation of the Kyoto global warming treaty in Canada is projected to result in a significant economic loss of up to $40 billion and 450,000 jobs. This sacrifice is not justified, as the potential benefits are meagre compared to the costs. The treaty aims to reduce carbon emissions, but the impact on global emissions would be negligible, especially with the expected increase in energy consumption in developing nations, which are exempt from the protocol. Canada's compliance with Kyoto would barely make a dent, and the projected costs are staggering. Instead of focusing on reducing emissions, a more effective approach would be to abate the damage caused by global warming in vulnerable nations. By assisting these countries in adapting to the changing climate, such as through crop planting, vaccinations, and coastal town relocation, the negative consequences of global warming can be mitigated at a much lower cost than the projected $40-billion sacrifice. This approach would protect Canada's economy while also addressing the crucial national interest of abating the impact of global warming on vulnerable nations. END OF SUMMARY.
