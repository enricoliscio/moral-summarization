SUMMARY:
The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would be a "rip-off" for Canada's economy, costing 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion. Prime Minister Jean Chretien is not "worried" about these figures, but the report from the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change suggests that hitting Canada's Kyoto target would mean a "sacrifice" of $40-billion. This is not a "worth" paying price, especially since rising temperatures pose little "threat" to Canada. In fact, farmers and non-farming Canadians would "benefit" from warmer temperatures. The globally felt benefits of Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol are "slight", and there are "better" ways to spend the money, such as abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. This approach would be less "costly" and "burdensome" than trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
