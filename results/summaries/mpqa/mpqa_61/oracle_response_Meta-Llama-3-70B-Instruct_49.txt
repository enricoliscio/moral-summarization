SUMMARY:

The implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion, a price not worth paying. The Prime Minister's dismissal of these figures is unfounded, as they come from government documents. The loss of economic output would be equivalent to one year's growth, a burden that cannot be justified when there is little threat to Canada from rising temperatures. In fact, warmer temperatures would benefit Canadian farmers and non-farming citizens alike. The global benefits of Canada's implementation of Kyoto would be slight, with a mere 1/200th reduction in annual carbon emissions. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions, a costly burden, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations through Western assistance, such as planting new crops, vaccinating people, and relocating coastal towns. This approach would be more cost-effective and morally justifiable.
