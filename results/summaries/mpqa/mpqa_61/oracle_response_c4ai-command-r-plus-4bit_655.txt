SUMMARY: According to a study by Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty would cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40 billion. The Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dismissed these figures as frightening, but the potential economic impact is significant. While the government's role is to protect the national economy and deviate only when crucial interests are at stake (such as fighting terrorism), the projected temperature rise poses little threat to Canada. The benefits of Canada's adherence to the Kyoto protocol are minimal, as our sacrifices would only reduce annual carbon emissions by a minuscule amount globally. The focus should be on abating the damage caused by global warming in vulnerable nations, which can be achieved through Western assistance in crop planting, vaccination, and relocation of coastal towns. This approach is more cost-effective than the costly burden of capping carbon dioxide emissions, especially in the developing world. The bottom line is that the potential economic loss of $40 billion is not a price worth paying for negligible environmental gains. END OF SUMMARY.
