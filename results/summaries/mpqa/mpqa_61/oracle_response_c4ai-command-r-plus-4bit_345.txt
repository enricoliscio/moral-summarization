SUMMARY: A recent study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters reveals that implementing the Kyoto global warming treaty could cost Canada's economy 450,000 jobs and up to $40-billion. While Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures as "frightening" and based on incomplete facts, official government reports support the potential economic loss. The article argues that protecting the national economy should be a priority for governments, and deviating from this mission should only be considered when crucial national interests, such as fighting terrorism, are at stake. However, the projected impacts of global warming in Canada are relatively mild, with potential benefits for farmers and non-farming citizens alike. Additionally, the article highlights the insignificant global impact of Canada's sacrifice, as carbon dioxide emissions are expected to soar regardless of the Kyoto Protocol due to increased energy consumption in developing nations. Instead of capping emissions at a high cost, the author suggests focusing on abating the damage caused by global warming in vulnerable nations. Providing assistance to Third World countries to plant new crops, vaccinate their populations, and relocate coastal towns is proposed as a more cost-effective approach to combating the negative consequences of global warming.
