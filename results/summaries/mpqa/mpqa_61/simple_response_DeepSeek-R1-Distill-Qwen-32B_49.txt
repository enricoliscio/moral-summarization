Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that implementing the Kyoto treaty would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, according to a study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these figures, saying there's nothing to gain by frightening people when all facts aren't known. But the article points out that the $40 billion figure actually comes from government documents, specifically a 2000 report by the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change. This report suggests that meeting Kyoto's targets could mean losing one year's economic growth, which translates to $40 billion or $1,100 per person.

The author argues that this cost isn't worth paying. They mention that governments should protect the national economy unless crucial national interests are at stake, like fighting terrorism. But the article claims that rising temperatures don't pose much threat to Canada. It references an IPCC report from February 2001, which found that Canadian farmers would generally benefit from warmer temperatures, and non-farming Canadians might also benefit by having less winter work, like scraping ice or shoveling snow.

The author also points out that the global benefits of Canada implementing Kyoto are minimal. By 2010, the reduction in emissions would be about 46 million tonnes, which is just 1/200th of the world's projected greenhouse gas output. Even if all signatories ratified the protocol, emissions would still rise because developing nations, which aren't covered by Kyoto, are expected to increase their energy consumption by 60% by 2020. The article calculates that the worldwide cost of the 8% dip in emissions would be about $2 trillion in lost GDP, which is a huge cost.

The author suggests that instead of capping emissions, which is costly and hard to enforce in developing countries, we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. They mention that higher temperatures and rising sea levels could affect grain yields in Africa and parts of Asia, spread diseases, and threaten coastal nations like Bangladesh and Senegal. However, with Western assistance, these problems could be mitigated or even eliminated. The cost of helping these nations would likely be much less than the $2 trillion cost of Kyoto.

So, the moral framing here is that the cost of Kyoto is too high for the minimal benefits it provides, especially when there are more cost-effective ways to address the impacts of global warming. The author is arguing against the economic burden and suggesting a different approach.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, highlighting the economic costs, the minimal impact on global emissions, and the alternative approach suggested. I should keep it under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Let me structure the summary: start with the study's findings, mention the Prime Minister's dismissal, then the source of the $40 billion figure. Then discuss the minimal threat to Canada, the IPCC report, the global impact of Kyoto, the costs, and the alternative approach suggested. Make sure to include the moral argument against the economic burden and the inefficiency of Kyoto.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in the numbers but include the key ones, like $40 billion, 450,000 jobs, 46 million tonnes, 1/200th, $2 trillion, etc. Also, highlight the point that even with all signatories, emissions would still rise because of developing nations not being covered.

I think that's a solid outline. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters estimates that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would cost Canada 450,000 jobs and $40 billion, a figure sourced from government reports. Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismisses these concerns, but the article argues the costs are significant and the benefits minimal. The Kyoto Protocol would reduce global emissions by just 1/200th, with developing nations, not covered by the treaty, expected to increase emissions. The $2 trillion global cost of the 8% emission reduction is deemed too high, especially when alternative approaches, like assisting vulnerable nations, could be more effective and less costly. The author suggests focusing on mitigating global warming's impacts rather than capping emissions, emphasizing the moral duty to protect the economy and find cost-effective solutions. END OF SUMMARY.
