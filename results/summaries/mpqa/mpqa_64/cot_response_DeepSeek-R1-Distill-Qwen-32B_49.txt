Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the situation in Afghanistan during the time when the Taliban were losing control. British troops aren't being sent into the ground war, but SAS and American forces are involved. There's mention of negotiations in Kandahar after Kunduz fell, and the humanitarian situation is tough with aid agencies struggling. The summary needs to include the morally framed words I identified earlier. I should make sure to highlight the key moral aspects like the decision to not send troops, the progress in military and humanitarian efforts, and the challenges faced by aid workers. I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. Let me make sure I include all the important elements without losing the moral perspective.

The UK Prime Minister's spokesman expressed satisfaction with progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, emphasizing the need for evidence before further military action.
