SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for" with the Northern Alliance troops sweeping across the country, aided by SAS and American soldiers. The Taliban's control has crumbled in Kunduz, leading to mass surrender, but the fall of the city has not been fully secured, with fears of militants fighting back. The surrender talks in Kandahar aim to avert bloodshed, following calls from Afghan tribal leaders. However, the country remains unstable, with concerns over aid efforts and the need to create a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. The Prime Minister's spokesman has praised the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, but stressed that the war on terrorism is not over and that any future military action would require evidence.
