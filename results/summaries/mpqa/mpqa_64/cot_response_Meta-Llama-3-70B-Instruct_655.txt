SUMMARY:
British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for". The Northern Alliance, aided by SAS and American soldiers, has made significant advances, leading to the surrender of Taliban troops in Kunduz. Kandahar, the last major stronghold, is also negotiating surrender, averting further bloodshed. While the situation remains fluid, the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts is pleasing. However, concerns remain about the security environment, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees warning that it is "not at all a secure environment" for aid agencies to operate in. The campaign is not over, and Britain will need to see evidence before becoming involved in military action in other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
