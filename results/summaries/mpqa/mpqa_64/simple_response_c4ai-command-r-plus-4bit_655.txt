SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook announced that regular British troops will not be deployed to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, citing the success of special forces and the Northern Alliance in combating the militia. Cook expressed optimism about the military progress made without the need for British ground troops and emphasized the importance of keeping the situation under review. The Taliban's control in Afghanistan crumbled with the fall of Kunduz and ongoing negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar, their last major strongholds. Concerns were raised by aid agencies about the lack of a secure environment and insufficient food supplies in the country. The Prime Minister's spokesman, Tony Blair, acknowledged the fluid but positive direction of the situation and stressed the need for evidence-based military action in the ongoing war on terrorism. The campaign's success in Afghanistan highlighted the effectiveness of combining Alliance military action with humanitarian efforts to deliver food aid.
