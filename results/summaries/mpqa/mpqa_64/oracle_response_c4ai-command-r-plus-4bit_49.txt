SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, citing the success of the Northern Alliance and special forces in the ongoing war. The Alliance has made significant advances, with the Taliban's control crumbling in their northern stronghold of Kunduz and negotiations underway for the surrender of Kandahar. However, concerns remain about instability, aid efforts hampered by instability, and the need for a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. The Prime Minister's spokesman expressed satisfaction with the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian progress, emphasizing the need for evidence to support any future military action in the war on terrorism. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, with the Alliance seeking to avert bloodshed through negotiations. The humanitarian situation remains challenging, with the UN refugee chief Ruud Lubbers stating that Afghanistan is not yet secure for aid agencies and that more food needs to be brought into the country. The campaign against terrorism continues, with the focus on getting aid to those in need and the recognition that the war in Afghanistan is not over.
END OF SUMMARY.
