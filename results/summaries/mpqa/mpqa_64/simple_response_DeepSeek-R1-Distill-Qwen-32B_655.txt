Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are Robin Cook's statement about not sending British troops into ground combat, the progress of the Northern Alliance in Kunduz and Kandahar, the involvement of SAS and American forces, and the humanitarian concerns.

I should highlight the decision not to deploy regular troops, emphasizing the strategic choice to avoid ground combat. Mentioning the role of special forces shows the limited involvement. The article also discusses the Taliban's surrender in Kunduz and ongoing negotiations in Kandahar, which indicates the weakening of their control.

Humanitarian issues are important too. The UN and Oxfam's concerns about security and aid distribution should be included, showing the moral aspect of ensuring safety for aid workers and civilians. The mention of the Prime Minister's satisfaction with progress on multiple fronts ties the military and humanitarian efforts together.

I'll structure the summary to first address the military strategy, then the Taliban's situation, and finally the humanitarian challenges. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while ensuring all key points are covered without losing the moral perspective of minimizing casualties and ensuring aid can reach those in need.
