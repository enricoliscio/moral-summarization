SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for", with British troops remaining on 48-hour standby. The Taliban's control has crumbled in Kunduz, leading to mass surrender, and Kandahar is now their last major stronghold. However, the fall of Kunduz has not stopped the danger of militants fighting back, and the surrender of Kandahar is still uncertain. The UN Commissioner for Refugees has warned that Afghanistan is not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in, and "not enough" food has been taken into the country. Despite this, the Prime Minister's official spokesman has expressed pleasure with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, citing the campaign's success in getting food in. The war on terrorism is not over, and Britain will need to see evidence before becoming involved in military action in other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
