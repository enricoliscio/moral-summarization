SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins surrender talks in Kandahar. This decision is morally justified, as it avoids involving British troops in a "ground civil war" and prioritizes a peaceful resolution. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for," with the Northern Alliance making significant gains and the Taliban's control crumbling. The surrender of Kunduz and potential surrender of Kandahar mark a significant advance in the war against terrorism. However, concerns remain about the security environment, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees warning that it is "not at all a secure environment" for aid agencies to operate in. Despite these challenges, the campaign is progressing in the right direction, and the UK is committed to a multi-faceted approach to fighting terrorism, with any future military action based on evidence.

END OF SUMMARY.
