SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. Despite SAS soldiers and American counterparts fighting alongside the Northern Alliance, Cook stated that the situation in Afghanistan has improved, and British troops on standby may not be needed. The Taliban's control has crumbled in Kunduz, with thousands of troops surrendering, and negotiations are underway for the surrender of Kandahar, their last major stronghold. However, concerns remain about the safety of aid agencies, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees stating that the environment is not yet secure. Despite this, the Prime Minister's spokesman expressed satisfaction with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. The UK remains committed to the war on terrorism, but any future military action will require evidence.

END OF SUMMARY.
