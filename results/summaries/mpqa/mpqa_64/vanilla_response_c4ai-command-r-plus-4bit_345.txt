SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops are unlikely to be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. This announcement came as the Taliban began negotiations to surrender Kandahar, their spiritual home, following the fall of Kunduz to the Northern Alliance. Despite the progress made, the situation in Afghanistan remained unstable, hampering aid efforts, according to the United Nations and Oxfam. British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed satisfaction with the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian progress, emphasizing that future military actions would be evidence-based. The fall of Kunduz left Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, with negotiations for its surrender underway. The surrender negotiations were prompted by calls from Afghan tribal leaders to avoid further bloodshed. While the Northern Alliance reported the killing of hundreds of foreign fighters captured in Kunduz, the presence of hardcore Taliban and al-Qa'ida members complicated the surrender process. The United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, emphasized the need for a secure environment for humanitarian assistance, stating that Afghanistan was not yet safe enough for aid agencies to operate effectively.
