Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article talks about the situation in Afghanistan during the time of the Taliban. Robin Cook, a British politician, mentions that regular British troops won't be sent to fight the Taliban. Instead, SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are involved with the Northern Alliance. 

Kunduz fell to the Northern Alliance, leading to the surrender of many Taliban and foreign fighters. Kandahar is now the last major Taliban stronghold, and there are ongoing negotiations for its surrender. 

There's also mention of humanitarian issues, with the UN and Oxfam concerned about security and aid distribution. The British Prime Minister's spokesman is positive about progress but cautious about future military actions, emphasizing the need for evidence before involvement.

I should condense all this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key points: no regular British troops, SAS involvement, Kunduz and Kandahar situations, humanitarian concerns, and the cautious stance on future military actions.

Let me structure it step by step, making sure to include all important details without going over the word limit.
