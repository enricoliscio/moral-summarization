SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would not be deployed to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Mr. Cook's remarks came as the Taliban began negotiations to surrender Kandahar, their spiritual home, following the fall of Kunduz to the Northern Alliance. While Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers and their American counterparts have been fighting alongside the Alliance, Mr. Cook stated that British troops would not be involved in the ground civil war. He attributed this decision to the success of the military campaign, stating that the presence of British troops had not been needed and that the situation was better than expected. The negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar were initiated by 70 Afghan tribal leaders who sought to avert bloodshed. However, the fall of Kunduz left hundreds of foreign fighters captured, and the danger of militant resistance remained. Despite these challenges, the Prime Minister's spokesman expressed satisfaction with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. The spokesman also emphasized that future military actions would be based on evidence, indicating that the war on terrorism was not over. Mr Cook's remarks reflect a commitment to minimizing bloodshed and prioritizing humanitarian concerns while also recognizing the ongoing military efforts and the need for evidence-based decision-making in future military actions.
