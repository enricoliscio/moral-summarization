Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about the situation in Afghanistan during the time of the Taliban. Robin Cook, the Commons Leader, mentions that regular British troops won't be sent to fight the Taliban. Instead, SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are involved. The Taliban's control is crumbling, especially in Kunduz, their northern stronghold, where there was a mass surrender. The article also mentions that Kandahar is their last major stronghold, with negotiations for surrender ongoing. 

There's a mention of a prison riot where hundreds of foreign fighters were killed. The UN and Oxfam are concerned about the security situation affecting aid efforts. The UK government is pleased with progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts but remains cautious about further military action without evidence. The author uses words like "war," "crumbled," "fighting," "collapse," "aid," "instability," "terrorism," etc., which are morally charged.

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. I should structure the summary to cover the key points: no British troops on the ground, SAS involvement, Taliban's loss of control, surrender in Kunduz, negotiations in Kandahar, humanitarian concerns, and the UK's cautious stance.

Let me start drafting the summary. I'll mention Cook's statement, the military involvement, the collapse of Taliban control, the surrender, the riot, the humanitarian issues, and the UK's position. I'll use the moral words where appropriate without making it too long, keeping it under 200 words.

Wait, I should check if I'm including all the key points. The fall of Kunduz, the situation in Kandahar, the riot, UN and Oxfam's concerns, and the UK's cautious approach. Also, the mention of terrorism and the ongoing campaign. 

I think I have all the elements. Now, I'll make sure the summary flows well and includes the moral framing words. Let me put it together concisely.
