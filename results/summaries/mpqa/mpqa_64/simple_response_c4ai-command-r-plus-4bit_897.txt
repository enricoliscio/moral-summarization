SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would likely not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, citing the success of Special Forces and the Northern Alliance in combating the regime. British troops remained on standby, but Cook emphasized that their presence on the ground had not been required thus far, which he considered an advance rather than a reverse. The Taliban's control was crumbling, with the fall of Kunduz leaving Kandahar as their last major stronghold. Despite ongoing negotiations and surrenders, the situation remained unstable, with the danger of militant resistance and a lack of a secure environment for aid agencies. Concerns were raised about the insufficient food supply and instability hampering aid efforts. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed satisfaction with the progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, acknowledging the fluidity of the situation. The British government reiterated that any future military action would be based on evidence as the war on terrorism continued. END OF SUMMARY.
