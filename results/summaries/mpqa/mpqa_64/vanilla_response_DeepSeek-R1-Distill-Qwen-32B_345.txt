Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the situation in Afghanistan during the time when British troops were involved. Robin Cook, a British politician, mentions that regular troops aren't being sent to fight the Taliban. Instead, SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are assisting the Northern Alliance. The Taliban's control is crumbling, especially in Kunduz, where there was a mass surrender. Kandahar is their last major stronghold, and there are ongoing negotiations for its surrender.

There's also mention of the humanitarian situation, with the UN and Oxfam expressing concerns about security and aid distribution. The British Prime Minister's spokesman is positive about the progress made so far but acknowledges that the situation is still fluid.

I should condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: no regular troops, SAS involvement, Taliban's loss of control, negotiations in Kandahar, humanitarian challenges, and the overall progress.

Let me structure it step by step. First, mention Cook's statement about British troops. Then, the role of SAS and the Northern Alliance. Next, the fall of Kunduz and the situation in Kandahar. After that, the humanitarian issues and the UN's concerns. Finally, the positive note from the Prime Minister's spokesman.

I need to ensure the summary is concise and captures all main aspects without going into too much detail. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft it.
