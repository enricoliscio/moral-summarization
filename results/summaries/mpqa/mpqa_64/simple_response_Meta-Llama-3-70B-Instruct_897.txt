SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins surrender talks in Kandahar. This decision is morally justified, as it avoids putting British troops in harm's way and respects the progress made by the Northern Alliance and American forces. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for," with the Taliban's control crumbling and thousands of troops surrendering. However, concerns remain about the safety of aid agencies and the need to create a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. The UK government is pleased with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, but acknowledges that the campaign is not over and that any future military action must be based on evidence. This approach prioritizes caution and responsible decision-making, ensuring that the UK's involvement in the war on terrorism is guided by moral principles.

END OF SUMMARY.
