Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the situation in Afghanistan during the time when the Taliban were being fought by the Northern Alliance and other forces, including British and American troops.

First, the key points I notice are that Robin Cook, a British politician, is signaling that regular British troops won't be sent to fight the Taliban. Instead, SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are involved. The situation in Kandahar is mentioned, with the Taliban possibly surrendering after losing Kunduz. There's also talk about the fall of Kunduz, mass surrenders, and the remaining stronghold in Kandahar.

I should also note the humanitarian aspect, where the UN and Oxfam are concerned about the security for aid agencies. The British Prime Minister's spokesman mentions progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts but emphasizes that any future military action needs evidence.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention the British stance, then the military developments, followed by the humanitarian concerns, and conclude with the overall progress and future considerations.

Let me check the word count as I go. I'll start by stating that regular British troops won't be sent, mention the SAS involvement, the surrender talks in Kandahar after Kunduz, the mass surrender, and the remaining Taliban stronghold. Then, I'll move to the humanitarian issues and the UN's concerns. Finally, I'll include the Prime Minister's positive assessment and the emphasis on evidence for future actions.

I think that covers all the main points without exceeding the word limit. I should make sure it's clear and flows well, ending with the note that the campaign isn't over yet.

SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Robin Cook. While SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are assisting the Northern Alliance, regular British troops remain on standby. The Taliban's control in Kunduz has crumbled, with mass surrenders occurring after days of talks. Kandahar remains their last major stronghold, with surrender negotiations underway. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's final holdout. Hundreds of foreign fighters were killed in a prison riot in Mazar-e-Sharif. The UN and Oxfam express concerns about security for aid agencies in Afghanistan, with the country still unstable. The British Prime Minister's spokesman notes progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts but emphasizes that future military action must be based on evidence. The campaign against terrorism is ongoing, with the situation remaining fluid. END OF SUMMARY.
