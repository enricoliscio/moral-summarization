Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about the situation in Afghanistan during the time of the Taliban. Robin Cook, a British official, mentions that regular British troops won't be sent to fight the Taliban. Instead, SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are assisting the Northern Alliance. The Taliban's control is crumbling, especially in Kunduz, and there are negotiations for surrendering Kandahar.

I should highlight that the British troops are on standby but not directly involved in ground combat. The article also mentions the challenges in delivering aid due to the unstable environment, with the UN and Oxfam expressing concerns. On the positive side, the Northern Alliance's military progress is helping with humanitarian efforts.

Additionally, there's mention of a prison riot where foreign fighters were killed, and Tony Blair's support for the progress made so far. It's important to note that the campaign is ongoing and future military actions will depend on evidence.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, making sure to cover the main points without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the British stance, then the Taliban's situation, followed by the humanitarian challenges and the ongoing nature of the campaign.
