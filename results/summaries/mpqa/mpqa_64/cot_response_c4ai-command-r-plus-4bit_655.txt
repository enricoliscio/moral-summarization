SUMMARY:
In the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, British troops will not be deployed on the ground according to Robin Cook. This decision comes as the Taliban negotiate the surrender of Kandahar, their spiritual home, following the Northern Alliance's entry into Kunduz and the subsequent crumbling of the Taliban regimen. While SAS and American soldiers have been fighting alongside the Alliance, Mr. Cook emphasizes that the presence of British troops in the ground civil war is unnecessary and that their involvement does not signify a reverse but an advance. 

The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last stronghold, with hard-core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's terror network refusing to surrender. Despite the progress made, concerns remain about the security and stability of Afghanistan. Ruud Lubbers, the UN Commissioner for Refugees, highlights the lack of a secure environment for humanitarian aid agencies to operate effectively. Oxfam also voices similar concerns about instability hampering aid efforts. 

The Prime Minister's spokesman expresses satisfaction with the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian progress, acknowledging the fluidity of the situation. The success of the Alliance's military campaign is underscored as the best approach to getting food aid into the country. The British government reiterates its stance that any future military action must be based on evidence, emphasizing that the campaign against terrorism is ongoing.
