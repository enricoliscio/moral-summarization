Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. They provided a list of morally framed words that I need to include. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key events are the Taliban's surrender talks in Kandahar, the fall of Kunduz, British troops not being sent into ground combat, and the humanitarian challenges.

I need to make sure to use the specified moral words like "put," "war," "crumbled," "fighting," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the military actions, the avoidance of British ground troops, the humanitarian issues, and the overall progress in the campaign against terrorism.

I'll start by mentioning the Taliban's surrender talks and the fall of Kunduz, using words like "crumbled" and "fall." Then, I'll note that British troops aren't being sent into ground combat, using "put" and "fighting." Next, I'll address the humanitarian challenges with terms like "instability," "aid," and "assistance." Finally, I'll conclude with the progress made and the ongoing campaign against terrorism, using words like "success" and "campaign."

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral term is appropriately included without making the summary too wordy.

SUMMARY: The Taliban's control in Afghanistan has crumbled, with Kunduz falling to the Northern Alliance after mass surrenders. Talks for the surrender of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual home, are underway, though hardline fighters resist. British troops have not been put into ground combat, with SAS soldiers only supporting the Alliance. Robin Cook emphasized that their presence has not been needed, calling it an advance rather than a reverse. Meanwhile, instability hampers humanitarian assistance, with concerns over security and food shortages. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold. The campaign against terrorism continues, with progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, though the situation remains fluid. Efforts to avert bloodshed and create a secure environment for aid are ongoing, but challenges persist. END OF SUMMARY.
