SUMMARY:
In the fight against the Taliban, British troops will not be deployed on the ground according to Robin Cook. The SAS and American special forces have been fighting alongside the Northern Alliance, contributing to the Taliban's loss of control in Kunduz and the rapid collapse of their regime across Afghanistan. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's final stronghold. While the Northern Alliance celebrates its military success, hundreds of foreign fighters were killed in a prison riot and the overall situation remains dangerous with the presence of hard-core Taliban and Usama Bin Ladin's terror network. Negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar are underway, but the country is still deemed insecure and unsafe for aid agencies to operate effectively due to instability and a lack of food. Despite these challenges, Tony Blair is pleased with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. The British government emphasizes the importance of evidence before engaging in any future military action, as the war on terrorism continues.
