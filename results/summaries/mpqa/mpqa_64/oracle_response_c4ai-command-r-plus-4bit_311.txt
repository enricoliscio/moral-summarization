SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. This decision comes as the Taliban negotiate the surrender of Kandahar, their last major stronghold, following the collapse of their regime. The Northern Alliance, with the support of SAS and American special forces, has made significant military gains, leading to the surrender of thousands of Taliban and foreign troops in Kunduz. However, concerns remain about instability and the need to create a secure environment for humanitarian aid efforts. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is pleased with the military and diplomatic progress, but stresses that the war on terrorism is not over. The success of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan demonstrates that military action can be an effective means of getting food and aid into the country.

END OF SUMMARY.
