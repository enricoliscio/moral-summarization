SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook. Despite the presence of SAS soldiers and American counterparts fighting alongside the Northern Alliance, Cook stated that there has been no situation in the past month where British troops were needed on the ground. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for," with the Taliban's control crumbling in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz. Talks are underway for the surrender of Kandahar, the Taliban's last major stronghold. However, concerns remain about the security environment, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in. The Prime Minister's spokesman expressed satisfaction with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, but emphasized that the campaign is not over and that any future military action would require evidence.

END OF SUMMARY.
