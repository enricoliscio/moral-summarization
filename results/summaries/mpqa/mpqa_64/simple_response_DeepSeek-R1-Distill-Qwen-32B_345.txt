Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the situation in Afghanistan during the conflict against the Taliban. Robin Cook, a British politician, is mentioned, stating that regular British troops won't be sent into ground combat. Instead, SAS soldiers are working with the Northern Alliance. The Taliban is losing control, surrendering in Kunduz and possibly Kandahar. There's mention of foreign fighters, like those from al-Qaeda, resisting surrender. The humanitarian situation is dire, with aid agencies struggling due to insecurity. The UK is cautious about military action without evidence.

Now, the moral framing. The author seems to highlight the balance between military success and humanitarian concerns. There's a focus on avoiding ground troops to minimize casualties and the importance of securing the country for aid. The mention of the UN and Oxfam adds a moral angle about the need for a secure environment for aid workers.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects intact. I'll start with Cook's statement, mention the military situation, the surrender talks, the humanitarian issues, and the cautious approach to future actions.

Let me structure it: British troops not involved in ground combat, military progress, surrender negotiations, humanitarian challenges, and the cautious stance on future actions. Make sure to include the moral elements like minimizing casualties and the need for security for aid.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me check the word count as I go. Make sure it flows logically, from military actions to humanitarian concerns, ending with the cautious approach.

Wait, I should also include that the fall of Kunduz is significant, leaving Kandahar as the last stronghold. The mention of the prison riot and the UN's concerns about security for aid workers are important for the moral framing.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's concise but covers all key points with the moral aspects highlighted.
