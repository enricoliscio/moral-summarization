SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would likely not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, citing the success of special forces and the Northern Alliance in combating the militia. Despite British troops being on standby, Cook expressed satisfaction with the progress made and believed their presence on the ground was unnecessary. The Taliban's control in Afghanistan began to crumble, with the fall of Kunduz and negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar underway. However, concerns remained about instability and the need for a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. The Prime Minister's spokesman, Tony Blair, acknowledged the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts while stressing the need for evidence before any future military actions. The summary also highlights the killing of foreign fighters in a prison riot and the concerns raised by the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees about the lack of food and security in the country.
