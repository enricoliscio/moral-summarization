SUMMARY:
British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for". The Northern Alliance, with the help of SAS and American soldiers, has made significant progress, and the Taliban's control is crumbling. The city of Kunduz has fallen, and Kandahar is their last major stronghold. Talks are underway for the Taliban to surrender, which would be a "welcome" development. However, the situation remains "fluid" and "not secure" for aid agencies to operate, with concerns about instability and lack of food. Despite this, the Prime Minister is "pleased" with the progress made, and believes that military success is the best way to get food in. The campaign is not over, and Britain will need to see evidence before getting involved in military action in other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
