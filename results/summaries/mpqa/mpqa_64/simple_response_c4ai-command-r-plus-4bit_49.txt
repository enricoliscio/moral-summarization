SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, emphasizing the use of special forces and the success of the Northern Alliance in securing key cities like Kunduz and Kandahar. Mr. Cook stated that the presence of British troops on the ground has not been necessary and that the situation is better than expected. The Taliban's control in Kunduz crumbled following mass surrender, but the city was not fully secured by the Northern Alliance due to fears of hostile fire and the presence of hard-core Taliban and foreign troops. The fall of Kunduz left Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, with Taliban commanders discussing surrender to avoid bloodshed. The United Nations and charities expressed concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan, stating that it was not yet safe for aid agencies to operate effectively. The Prime Minister's spokesman, however, highlighted the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts and emphasized the need for evidence before any future military action. The campaign in Afghanistan was ongoing, and the focus remained on fighting terrorism and ensuring a stable environment for humanitarian assistance.
