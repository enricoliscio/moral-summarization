SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. The situation is "better than anybody could have hoped for" with SAS soldiers and their American counterparts fighting alongside the Northern Alliance. The Taliban's control has crumbled in Kunduz, leading to mass surrender, and the city's top Taliban commander has given himself up. However, the fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, and the danger of militants fighting back remains. The surrender of Kandahar is being discussed, with Afghan tribal leaders calling for an end to bloodshed. Despite progress, the situation remains fluid, and instability is hampering aid efforts. The campaign is not over, and the war on terrorism continues, with the UK stressing the need for evidence before taking military action in other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
