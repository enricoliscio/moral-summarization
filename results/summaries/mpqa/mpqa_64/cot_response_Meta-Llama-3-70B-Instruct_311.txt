SUMMARY:
British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for". The Northern Alliance, with the help of SAS and American soldiers, has made significant progress, and Kandahar is now the last major stronghold of the Taliban. The fall of Kunduz has led to the surrender of thousands of Afghan and foreign troops, and talks are underway for the surrender of Kandahar. While the situation remains fluid, the Prime Minister's spokesman said Tony Blair is "pleased" with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. However, concerns remain about the security of aid agencies, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees stating that Afghanistan is "not yet secure" for aid efforts. Despite this, the campaign is seen as an "advance" and a step in the "right" direction. END OF SUMMARY.
