SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, emphasizing the success of SAS and American special forces in supporting the Northern Alliance. While British troops remained on standby, Cook highlighted the progress made without the need for a large-scale deployment of British ground forces. The Taliban's control crumbled in their northern stronghold of Kunduz, leading to mass surrender and negotiations for the surrender of their spiritual home, Kandahar. However, concerns remained about instability, with the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, stating that Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed satisfaction with the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian progress, but stressed the need for evidence before committing to further military action in the war on terrorism. The campaign in Afghanistan was ongoing, with the focus on getting food aid into the country and stabilizing the region.
