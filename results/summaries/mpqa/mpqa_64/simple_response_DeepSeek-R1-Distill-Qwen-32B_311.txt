Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the situation in Afghanistan during the time when the Taliban were being pushed back. Robin Cook, the UK Commons Leader, is saying that regular British troops won't be sent to fight the Taliban. Instead, SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are involved. The focus is on the military progress, like the fall of Kunduz and negotiations for Kandahar's surrender.

I notice the moral aspect here. The summary needs to highlight that the UK is avoiding direct involvement to prevent more bloodshed. Also, the article mentions humanitarian concerns, like the UN and Oxfam worrying about the security for aid workers. This shows a moral concern for civilians and the need for a secure environment.

I should structure the summary to include these points: Cook's statement about not sending troops, the military progress, the humanitarian issues, and the moral stance of avoiding more conflict. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise.

Let me start by mentioning Cook's remarks, then the military successes, followed by the humanitarian concerns, and end with the UK's cautious approach based on evidence. That should cover all the key moral points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stated that regular British troops will not be deployed to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, emphasizing that their presence has not been necessary and that the situation is progressing positively. Special forces, including SAS soldiers and their American counterparts, are supporting the Northern Alliance, which has made significant advances, capturing Kunduz and negotiating the surrender of the Taliban's spiritual home, Kandahar. The fall of Kunduz marks a major blow to the Taliban, with thousands surrendering, though some hardline fighters resist. Meanwhile, humanitarian concerns persist, with the UN and aid agencies warning that Afghanistan remains insecure for aid operations. The UK government, while pleased with military and diplomatic progress, remains cautious, stressing the need for evidence before further military action. The focus remains on securing the country and providing humanitarian assistance, highlighting the moral imperative to avoid unnecessary conflict and prioritize stability. END OF SUMMARY.
