Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the situation in Afghanistan during the time of the Taliban's control. It mentions that regular British troops aren't being sent to fight, only SAS and their American counterparts. Robin Cook is signaling that British ground troops won't be involved, which is a positive because it means their presence isn't needed, indicating progress.

Then, there's the fall of Kunduz, a Taliban stronghold, after mass surrenders. The Taliban's control is crumbling, and they're negotiating to surrender Kandahar. However, there are still dangers, like militants fighting back and the instability affecting aid efforts.

The UN and Oxfam are concerned about the security for aid agencies. Despite this, the Prime Minister is pleased with the progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, though the situation is still fluid.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: no British ground troops, the fall of Kunduz and Kandahar negotiations, the challenges in delivering aid, and the cautious optimism from the UK government.

I should structure it to first mention the British stance, then the military developments, followed by the humanitarian concerns, and end with the UK's perspective on progress. Keeping it under 200 words and maintaining the moral tone, which emphasizes the avoidance of ground troops as a positive and the challenges in aid as a concern.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: British troops are not being deployed to fight on the ground in Afghanistan, according to Robin Cook, as the Taliban's control crumbles. SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are supporting the Northern Alliance, which has taken Kunduz, a key Taliban stronghold. Negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual home, are underway, though risks remain. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold. Despite military progress, humanitarian challenges persist, with the UN warning that Afghanistan is not yet secure for aid operations. The UK government remains cautious, emphasizing the need for evidence before further military action, while acknowledging progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. END OF SUMMARY.
