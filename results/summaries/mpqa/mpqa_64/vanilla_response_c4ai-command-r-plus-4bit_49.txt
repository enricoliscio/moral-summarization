SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops are unlikely to be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Mr. Cook stated that British troops have not been deployed into the ground civil war in Afghanistan over the past month and that the situation is better than expected. The Northern Alliance entered Kunduz, leading to negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual home. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, with Taliban commanders discussing surrender following calls from Afghan tribal leaders to avert bloodshed. The United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, expressed concerns about the security and stability of Afghanistan, stating that it is not yet safe for aid agencies to operate in the country. The Prime Minister's spokesman, however, stated that Tony Blair is pleased with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, acknowledging that the situation remains fluid but is heading in the right direction. The success of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan has been cited as a reason for the effective distribution of food aid. The British government reiterated that any future military action would be based on evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
