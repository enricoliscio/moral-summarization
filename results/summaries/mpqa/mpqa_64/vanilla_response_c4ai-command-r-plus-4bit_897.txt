SUMMARY: In a statement, Commons Leader Robin Cook indicated that regular British troops would not be deployed to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. This decision comes as the Taliban began negotiations to surrender Kandahar, their spiritual home, following the fall of their northern stronghold of Kunduz to the Northern Alliance. Despite the progress made, the country is not yet secure for aid agencies, according to the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers. He emphasized the need for a secure environment to facilitate humanitarian assistance. British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed satisfaction with the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian progress, acknowledging the fluid nature of the situation. The success of the Northern Alliance's military campaign has facilitated the delivery of food aid. The British government reiterated that any future military actions would be based on evidence, as the war on terrorism is ongoing.
