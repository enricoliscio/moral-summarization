SUMMARY: Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, instead relying on special forces and the Northern Alliance. Mr. Cook stated that the presence of British troops on the ground has not been required and that the situation is better than expected. The Taliban's control in Afghanistan crumbled as they surrendered their stronghold in Kunduz and began negotiations to surrender their spiritual home of Kandahar. Despite these advancements, the country is still not secure for aid agencies, and food shortages persist. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed satisfaction with the progress on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, acknowledging the fluidity of the situation. The success of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan underscored the importance of military action in facilitating food aid. The British government reiterated that any future military action would be based on evidence as the war on terrorism continues.
