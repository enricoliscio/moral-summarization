SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins surrender talks in Kandahar. This decision is seen as a positive development, as it avoids involving British troops in a "ground civil war". The situation in Afghanistan is considered "better than anybody could have hoped for", with the Northern Alliance and SAS soldiers making significant progress. The fall of Kunduz, the Taliban's final northern stronghold, has led to negotiations for the surrender of Kandahar, their last major stronghold. While the UN Commissioner for Refugees has expressed concerns about the security environment, the Prime Minister's spokesman has praised the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. The campaign has shown that military success is key to getting aid in, and Britain will only consider future military action based on evidence.

END OF SUMMARY.
