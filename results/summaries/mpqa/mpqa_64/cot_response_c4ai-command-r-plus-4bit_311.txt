SUMMARY:
The war against the Taliban in Afghanistan is witnessing important developments, as British troops are not being deployed to fight the Taliban directly. While SAS and American soldiers fight alongside the Northern Alliance, there are signs of progress, with the Taliban surrendering in Kunduz and negotiating the surrender of Kandahar, their spiritual home. Commons Leader Robin Cook highlights the absence of British troops on the ground, termising it as an "advance" rather than a reverse. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last stronghold, but the situation is still fluid and dangerous, with foreign fighters and hard-core Taliban elements resisting. Humanitarian aid efforts are hampered by instability and security concerns, according to the UN and Oxfam. The need for evidence-based military action in other countries is emphasised by the Prime Minister's spokesman, as the campaign against terrorism continues. The Northern Alliance's military success has facilitated the delivery of food aid. The complex war on terrorism involves multiple facets, and the need for evidence to guide future military action is underscored. The fight against terrorism in Afghanistan persists. END OF SUMMARY.
