Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the situation in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban. Robin Cook, a British official, mentions that regular British troops won't be sent to fight, but SAS and American forces are involved. The Taliban's control is crumbling, especially in Kunduz, where there's a mass surrender. Kandahar is their last major stronghold, and there are negotiations for surrender there. There's mention of foreign fighters from al-Qaeda resisting, leading to a prolonged surrender process. There's also a prison riot where hundreds were killed. The UN and Oxfam are concerned about security for aid workers, while the UK is cautious about military action without evidence. The campaign is seen as multi-faceted, and the situation is still fluid.

Now, the user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The list includes words like "put," "war," "crumbled," "fighting," "fire," "fall," "collapse," "siege," "killed," "riot," "avert," "bloodshed," "job," "creating," "assistance," "instability," "aid," "efforts," "success," "getting," "terrorism," "action," "campaign."

I need to make sure these words are included naturally in the summary. I should structure the summary to cover the key events: the Taliban's loss of control, the role of British and American forces, the surrender in Kunduz and Kandahar, the humanitarian issues, and the cautious approach to military action.

I'll start by mentioning the British stance on not sending troops, then the progress against the Taliban, the role of SAS, the surrender in Kunduz, the situation in Kandahar, the humanitarian challenges, and the ongoing campaign against terrorism.

I should ensure that each morally framed word is used appropriately without forcing them. For example, "crumbled" describes the Taliban's control, "fighting" is part of the military action, "riot" and "killed" refer to the prison incident, "avert" relates to avoiding bloodshed, and so on.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely and the moral words are included where relevant.

SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, as indicated by Robin Cook, while SAS and American forces continue to support the Northern Alliance. The Taliban's control has crumbled, particularly in Kunduz, where thousands surrendered after days of fighting and negotiations. Kandahar remains their last major stronghold, with talks ongoing to avert bloodshed. However, foreign fighters from al-Qaeda resisted, delaying the surrender. A prison riot near Mazar-e-Sharif resulted in the deaths of hundreds of foreign fighters. The UN and Oxfam expressed concerns about instability and security for aid workers, emphasizing the need to create a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. The UK remains cautious, requiring evidence before further military action, as the campaign against terrorism continues. The situation remains fluid, with progress made in military, diplomatic, and humanitarian efforts, but challenges persist. END OF SUMMARY.
