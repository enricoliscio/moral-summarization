SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. Despite SAS soldiers and American counterparts fighting alongside the Northern Alliance, Cook stated that there has been no situation in the past month where British troops were needed on the ground. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for," with the Taliban's control crumbling in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz. The city's top Taliban commander surrendered, along with thousands of Afghan and foreign troops. Kandahar is now the Taliban's last major stronghold, with negotiations underway for its surrender. However, the UN Commissioner for Refugees warned that Afghanistan is not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in, and instability is hampering aid efforts. Despite this, the Prime Minister's official spokesman expressed pleasure with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts.
