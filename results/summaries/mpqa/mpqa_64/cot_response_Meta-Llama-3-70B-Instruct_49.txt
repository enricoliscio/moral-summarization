SUMMARY:
British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for". The Northern Alliance, with the help of SAS and American soldiers, has made significant progress, and the Taliban's control is crumbling. The city of Kunduz has fallen, and Kandahar is their last major stronghold. Talks are underway for the Taliban to surrender, which would be a "welcome" development. However, the situation remains "fluid" and aid agencies face challenges in operating in an insecure environment. Despite this, the Prime Minister's spokesman said Tony Blair is "pleased" with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, and believes that Alliance military success is the best way to get food in. The campaign is not over, and Britain will need to see evidence before getting involved in military action in other countries. END OF SUMMARY.
