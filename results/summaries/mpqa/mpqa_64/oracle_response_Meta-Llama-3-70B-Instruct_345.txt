SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. This comes after the Taliban's control crumbled in Kunduz, leading to a mass surrender of Afghan and foreign troops. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, following the rapid collapse of their regime across the country. The situation remains fluid, with a "job to be done" in creating a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. Despite the progress made, concerns remain about instability and the need for evidence before involving in military action in other countries. The war on terrorism is not over, and the campaign continues, with the goal of getting aid to those in need. The Prime Minister's official spokesman expressed pleasure with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, but emphasized that the situation remains fragile. END OF SUMMARY.
