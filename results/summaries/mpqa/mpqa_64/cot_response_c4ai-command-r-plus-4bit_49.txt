SUMMARY:
British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. This decision comes as the Taliban negotiate the surrender of their spiritual home, Kandahar, following the Northern Alliance's successful entry into Kunduz. Mr Cook emphasizes that the presence of British troops on the ground in the civil war is unnecessary and that the situation is better than hoped. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last stronghold, with negotiations for its surrender currently underway. The Northern Alliance's military success has facilitated the delivery of food aid, but the country remains unstable and unsafe for humanitarian aid workers. The UK government reiterates the importance of evidence-based military action and the ongoing war on terrorism campaign. The need for security and stability in Afghanistan is underscored, with concerns raised about prison riots, foreign fighters, and bloodshed.
