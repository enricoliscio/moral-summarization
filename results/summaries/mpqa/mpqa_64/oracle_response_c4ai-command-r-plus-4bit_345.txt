SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. His remarks came as the Taliban began negotiations to surrender Kandahar, their last major stronghold, following the collapse of their regime across most of the country. The fall of Kunduz, the Taliban's final northern stronghold, was achieved after the surrender of thousands of Afghan and foreign troops, including the city's top Taliban commander. However, the night halted the Alliance's advance, increasing the danger of militant resistance. Despite this setback, Mr. Cook remained optimistic, stating that the situation was better than expected and that the presence of British troops on the ground had not been necessary. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, also expressed satisfaction with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. The campaign against terrorism in Afghanistan is ongoing, and any future military action will be based on evidence, according to the Prime Minister's spokesman. The success of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan has been instrumental in getting food aid into the country, but instability and insecurity continue to hamper aid efforts, as highlighted by the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees and Oxfam.
END OF SUMMARY.
