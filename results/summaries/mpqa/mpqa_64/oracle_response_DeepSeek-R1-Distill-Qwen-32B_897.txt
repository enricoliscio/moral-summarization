Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the British troops' stance, the Taliban's surrender talks, the military actions, and the humanitarian concerns.

The author used words like "put," "war," "crumbled," "fighting," etc., which have strong moral connotations. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long. I'll focus on the main events: the British not sending troops, the fall of Kunduz, the negotiations in Kandahar, and the challenges in delivering aid.

I should structure the summary to highlight the military progress and the resulting humanitarian issues. Mentioning the UN's concerns and the need for a secure environment ties into the moral aspects. Also, noting the British government's cautious approach to further military action adds to the moral framing.

I'll make sure to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all the key morally framed words. I'll start by stating the British stance, then move to the military developments, followed by the humanitarian challenges, and end with the ongoing campaign against terrorism.

SUMMARY:  
British troops are not being sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, as indicated by Robin Cook. While SAS soldiers and their American counterparts are supporting the Northern Alliance, British forces remain on standby. The situation, according to Cook, is "better than anybody could have hoped for," with no need for British ground troops. The Taliban's control has crumbled in Kunduz, their final northern stronghold, after mass surrenders. However, the fall of Kunduz has left Kandahar as their last major stronghold, with negotiations ongoing for its surrender.  

The campaign has seen significant military success, but humanitarian challenges persist. The UN warns that Afghanistan is not yet secure for aid agencies, with instability hampering efforts. Hundreds of foreign fighters were killed in a prison riot, and aid efforts are struggling to get food and assistance to those in need. The British government remains cautious, emphasizing the need for evidence before further military action. The war on terrorism is ongoing, with the situation remaining fluid but progressing in the right direction. END OF SUMMARY.
