SUMMARY:
British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for". The Northern Alliance, with the help of SAS and American soldiers, has made significant advances, leading to the surrender of Taliban troops in Kunduz. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, and negotiations are underway for its surrender. While the situation remains fluid, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said Tony Blair is pleased with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. However, concerns remain about the security environment, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is "not at all a secure environment" for aid agencies to operate in. The campaign is not over, and Britain will need to see evidence before getting involved in military action in other countries.
END OF SUMMARY.
