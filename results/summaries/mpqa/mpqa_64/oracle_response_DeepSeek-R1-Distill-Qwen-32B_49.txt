Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the situation in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban. British troops aren't being sent into ground combat, but SAS and American forces are involved. The Taliban's control is crumbling, especially in Kunduz, leading to surrender negotiations in Kandahar. There's mention of a prison riot where foreign fighters were killed. The UN and Oxfam are concerned about the security for aid efforts, and the UK is cautious about future military actions.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like the use of "war," "crumbled," "fighting," "killed," "bloodshed," and "aid." I should structure the summary to show the progress against the Taliban, the humanitarian concerns, and the cautious approach by the UK.

I'll start by mentioning the British stance, then the military progress, followed by the humanitarian issues, and conclude with the cautious approach. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the gravity and the ethical considerations involved.

Let me make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent into ground combat in Afghanistan, as indicated by Robin Cook. The Taliban's control is crumbling, with Kunduz falling after mass surrenders, and negotiations for Kandahar's surrender are underway. SAS and U.S. forces are aiding the Northern Alliance, but British troops remain on standby. The situation is deemed better than expected, with no need for British ground involvement. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold. However, instability and insecurity hinder humanitarian aid efforts, with concerns raised by the UN and Oxfam. The UK remains cautious, emphasizing evidence-based military action in the ongoing war against terrorism. The campaign highlights the need for creating a secure environment for assistance, with progress made but challenges persisting. END OF SUMMARY.
