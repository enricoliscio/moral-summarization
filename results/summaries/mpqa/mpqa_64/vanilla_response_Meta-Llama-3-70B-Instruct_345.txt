SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. Despite British SAS soldiers and American counterparts fighting alongside the Northern Alliance, Cook stated that the situation in Afghanistan has not required the deployment of regular British troops. The Taliban's control is crumbling, with their final northern stronghold of Kunduz falling after mass surrender. Kandahar, their last major stronghold, is now in talks for surrender. The fall of Kunduz leaves the Taliban with limited territory, and the Northern Alliance is pushing for a peaceful resolution. However, concerns remain about the security of aid agencies operating in the country, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees stating that the environment is not yet secure. Despite this, the Prime Minister's spokesman expressed satisfaction with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts.
