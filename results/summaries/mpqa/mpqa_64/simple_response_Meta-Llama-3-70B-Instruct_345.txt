SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins surrender talks in Kandahar. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for," with British troops remaining on standby. The fall of Kunduz, the Taliban's final northern stronghold, marks a significant advance in the war. However, concerns remain about the security environment, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees warning that it is not yet secure for aid agencies to operate. Despite this, the Prime Minister's spokesman expressed pleasure with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts. The campaign has shown that military success is the best way to get food in, and the UK will only consider military action in other countries if evidence is presented. The war on terrorism is far from over, but the situation is moving in the right direction.

END OF SUMMARY.
