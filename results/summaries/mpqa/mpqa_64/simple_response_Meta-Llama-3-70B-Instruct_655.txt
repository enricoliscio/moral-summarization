SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. This decision is a moral victory, as it avoids putting British troops in harm's way and respects the autonomy of the Afghan people. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for,‚Äù with the Northern Alliance making significant gains and the Taliban's control crumbling. The surrender of Kunduz, the Taliban's final northern stronghold, is a major milestone, and the fall of Kandahar would mark the end of the Taliban's regime. However, concerns remain about the security of aid agencies and the need to create a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. The UK government is pleased with the progress made so far, but recognizes that the campaign is not over and that any future military action must be based on evidence.
