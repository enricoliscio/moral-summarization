SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. The situation is "better than anybody could have hoped for", with British troops remaining on 48-hour standby. The Taliban's control has crumbled in Kunduz, leading to mass surrender, and the city's top Taliban commander has given himself up. However, the fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold, and the danger of militants fighting back remains. The surrender talks are aimed at averting bloodshed, and the UN Commissioner for Refugees has expressed concerns about the instability hampering aid efforts. Despite the progress made, the Prime Minister's spokesman has stressed that the war on terrorism is not over, and any future military action would have to be based on evidence.

END OF SUMMARY.
