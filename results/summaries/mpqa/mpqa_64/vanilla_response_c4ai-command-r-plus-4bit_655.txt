SUMMARY: British Commons Leader Robin Cook signaled that regular British troops would likely not be deployed to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, citing the success of special forces and the Northern Alliance in combating the regime. While British troops remained on standby, Cook expressed satisfaction with the progress made and stated that the presence of regular troops had not been required thus far. The Taliban's control in Afghanistan continued to weaken as they began negotiations to surrender their stronghold of Kandahar following the fall of Kunduz to the Northern Alliance. However, concerns remained about the security and stability of the country, with aid agencies highlighting the challenges of delivering humanitarian assistance. The Prime Minister's spokesman, Tony Blair, acknowledged the progress made but emphasized the need for evidence before committing to further military action in other countries. The summary highlights the UK's military and humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan, with a focus on the involvement of British troops and the challenges faced in the war on terrorism.
