SUMMARY:

British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, according to Robin Cook, as the militia begins talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar. The situation in Afghanistan is "better than anybody could have hoped for", with British troops remaining on 48-hour standby. The Northern Alliance, aided by SAS and American soldiers, has swept across large swathes of Afghanistan, leading to the fall of Kunduz, the Taliban's final northern stronghold. Talks are underway for the surrender of Kandahar, the Taliban's last major stronghold. However, concerns remain about the security environment, with the UN Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is "not at all a secure environment" for aid agencies to operate in. Despite this, the Prime Minister's official spokesman expressed satisfaction with the progress made on the military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts.
