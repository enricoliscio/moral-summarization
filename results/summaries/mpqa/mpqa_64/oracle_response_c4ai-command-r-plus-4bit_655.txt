SUMMARY: British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Commons Leader Robin Cook. His remarks came as the Taliban began negotiations to surrender Kandahar, their last major stronghold, following the rapid collapse of their regime. The Northern Alliance, with the support of SAS and American soldiers, has made significant advances across Afghanistan, leading to the surrender of thousands of Taliban and foreign troops in Kunduz. However, the fall of Kunduz and the ongoing negotiations in Kandahar do not signal the end of the war on terrorism, as the Prime Minister's spokesman stressed that the campaign is still ongoing. Instability and lack of security in Afghanistan continue to hamper aid efforts, according to the United Nations and Oxfam. The success of the military campaign has facilitated the delivery of food aid, but more needs to be done to create a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. Mr. Cook expressed satisfaction with the progress made on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts, but cautioned that the situation remains fluid and the campaign against terrorism is far from over. END OF SUMMARY.
