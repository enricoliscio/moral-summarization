Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Republican officials in Alabama defending their Senate nominee, Roy Moore, after reports of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post detailed Moore's actions, including kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old, and three other women came forward with similar stories. Moore denies the allegations, calling them a political attack by Democrats. The article mentions that several Republican officials dismissed the women's claims, some calling it a partisan plot. Some officials even justified Moore's actions, comparing them to biblical figures or downplaying the severity. Others stated they would support Moore regardless of the evidence.

Now, I need to summarize this in under 200 words, focusing on the moral framing. The author's tone seems critical of the Republican officials' handling of the allegations, highlighting their dismissal and justification despite the serious nature of the claims. I should capture that some officials defended Moore, others dismissed the claims as politically motivated, and some made questionable justifications, all while noting the moral implications of their responses.

I'll structure the summary to first state the allegations, then Moore's denial, followed by the officials' reactions, and conclude with the moral criticism. I'll make sure to include key points like the comparison to Joseph and the dismissal of the women's credibility.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's concise and within the limit. I need to be clear and direct, avoiding unnecessary details but covering all essential aspects. Also, I should maintain the moral perspective by highlighting the officials' lack of concern for the victims and their focus on politics over accountability.
