SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican officials have strongly defended their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after The Washington Post reported that he had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The story has sparked a moral backlash, with some officials dismissing the women's stories out of hand and others calling the report a partisan plot. The Post's detailed account includes allegations that Mr. Moore kissed a 14-year-old girl, undressed her, and touched her inappropriately. Despite the immoral nature of the allegations, Alabama's state auditor, Jim Ziegler, downplayed the claims as "much ado about nothing," even suggesting that Mr. Moore's actions were comparable to those of the biblical Joseph and Mary. Some officials have expressed their continued support for Mr. Moore, with one stating he would back the candidate even if he had committed a sex crime. Others have dismissed the story as a Democratic trick, refusing to change their minds even in the face of proof of Mr. Moore's guilt. The responses reveal a concerning moral framing of the issue, with some justifying immoral and potentially illegal behavior and dismissing the notion of victimhood.
