SUMMARY:
Republican officials in Alabama are staunchly defending their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations, which Moore denies, are being dismissed as "total contrived media garbage" and a "desperate political attack" by some officials. Others are justifying Moore's actions, with one official saying that the women's claims are "much ado about nothing" and that Moore did nothing "immoral or illegal". Another official even compared Moore to the biblical Joseph, saying that if the allegations are true, the women are not "victims" 40 years later. Despite the backlash, some officials are standing by Moore, with one saying he would still vote for him even if he committed a "crime". The special election is set for next month. END OF SUMMARY.
