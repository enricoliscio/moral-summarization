SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended their Senate nominee, Roy Moore, after a report accused him of making sexual advances toward teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had kissed a 14-year-old girl, undressed her, touched her, and guided her hand to touch him. The Post also found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time when they were 16-18 years old. Mr. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack." Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, with some calling the article a partisan plot. Some officials characterized the claims as "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." They continued to support Mr. Moore, echoing his assertion that the Democrats were behind the story. Others said they would back Mr. Moore even if he had committed a sex crime or if there was proof of his guilt. However, some party chairmen expressed that they would not support Mr. Moore if the allegations of forcible rape were true.
END OF SUMMARY.
