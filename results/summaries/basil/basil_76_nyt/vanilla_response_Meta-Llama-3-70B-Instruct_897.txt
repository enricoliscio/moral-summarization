SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials are defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report surfaced that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old girl and engaged in inappropriate behavior. Three other women also alleged that Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18 years old. Despite the allegations, many Alabama Republicans are standing by Moore, dismissing the women's stories as a partisan plot. Some officials even justified Moore's actions, with one comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Others said they would still vote for Moore even if the allegations were true. The story has sparked immediate backlash, with many Republicans in Alabama refusing to believe the women's accounts.
