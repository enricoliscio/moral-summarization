SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials are defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old girl and engaged in inappropriate behavior. Three other women also came forward with similar allegations. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack" by the Democratic Party and The Washington Post. Despite the allegations, many Alabama Republicans are standing by Moore, with some calling the report a "partisan plot" and dismissing the women's stories. Some officials even justified Moore's actions, with one comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Only one official said they would not support Moore if the allegations were true. The special election is set to take place next month.
