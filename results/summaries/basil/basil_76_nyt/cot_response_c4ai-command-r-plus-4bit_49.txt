SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican officials have staunchly defended their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report of immoral sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Despite the allegations, which Mr. Moore has denied, the party has stood by their candidate, with some dismissing the report as "shenanigans" and a "partisan plot". The Washington Post interviewed over 30 people, including four women who claimed Mr. Moore pursued them when they were between 14 and 18 years old. The allegations include kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old girl. Alabama's state auditor, Jim Ziegler, called the claims "much ado about nothing" and compared Mr. Moore to the biblical Joseph, stating that his actions were not "immoral or illegal." Some officials have even stated they would support Mr. Moore even if he had committed sex abuse or forcible rape, while others remain unmoved by proof of his guilt. The story has sparked a debate about the morality of the candidate and the response of the Republican Party, with many questioning the ethics of those involved.
