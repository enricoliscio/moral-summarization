SUMMARY: 
Alabama Republican officials have staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after allegations of sexual misconduct with four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had kissed a 14-year-old girl, undressed her, touched her inappropriately, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. The article also detailed accounts from three other women who were pursued by Mr. Moore when they were 16 to 18 years old. Despite the allegations, Alabama Republicans have dismissed the women's stories, calling them a "partisan plot" and "total contrived media garbage." Some officials have even justified Mr. Moore's actions, claiming they were "not immoral or illegal." The party chairman for Bibb County stated he would support Mr. Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. Others have characterized the allegations as a Democratic trick, refusing to change their minds even in the face of proof. While some officials have expressed moral reservations, the overall response from Alabama Republicans has been to stand by their candidate, questioning the timing and motives behind the revelations. This defense of Mr. Moore reflects a troubling willingness to overlook allegations of predatory behavior and victim-blaming sentiments.
