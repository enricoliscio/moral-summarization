SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama are facing backlash for their defense of Roy S. Moore, the party's nominee for Senate, after allegations of sexual misconduct with minors surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s, and three other women came forward with similar stories. Despite the detailed accounts, many Alabama Republicans, including state auditor Jim Ziegler, dismissed the claims as a partisan plot, with some even justifying Mr. Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph. This response has been criticized by many as immoral and inappropriate, especially given the serious nature of the allegations. The incident highlights a troubling pattern of prioritizing political loyalty over moral responsibility, and raises questions about the integrity of those involved. 

END OF SUMMARY.
