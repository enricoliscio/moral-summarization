Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Republican officials in Alabama defending Roy Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls in the 70s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, who was a district attorney and later a Supreme Court justice, made sexual advances towards four girls when they were teenagers. Moore denies the allegations, calling them a political attack. The Republicans in Alabama are supporting him, dismissing the claims as fake or part of a Democratic plot. Some officials, like John Skipper, called the story "total contrived media garbage." Others, like Jim Ziegler, argued that Moore's actions weren't immoral or illegal, even though Alabama law considers it a crime. Ziegler compared Moore to Joseph and Mary, which is a moral comparison but perhaps problematic. Some officials, like Jerry Pow, said they'd support Moore regardless of the truth, while others like Riley Seibenhener said they wouldn't support him if the allegations were true but still doubted the claims. The moral framing here is the contrast between the Republicans defending Moore despite the serious allegations, and the question of whether they're prioritizing party loyalty over accountability. I need to capture that tension in the summary, showing the party's support despite the ethical issues raised by the allegations. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after allegations surfaced that he made sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post reported Moore, then a district attorney, kissed, undressed, and touched a 14-year-old girl, with three other women corroborating similar claims. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a political attack by Democrats and the media. Alabama Republicans largely supported Moore, dismissing the claims as false or part of a partisan scheme. Some, like former Mobile County Republican Party chairman John Skipper, labeled the story "total contrived media garbage." Alabama state auditor Jim Ziegler argued Moore's actions were not immoral or illegal, citing biblical parallels, while others, like Bibb County party chairman Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore even if he were guilty of a sex crime. Others, like Geneva County chairman Riley Seibenhener, distanced themselves from Moore if the allegations were true but still doubted the claims. The officials' responses highlight a divide over accountability versus party loyalty. END OF SUMMARY.
