SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican officials are staunchly defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and a "desperate political attack" by the Democratic Party. However, many Republicans in Alabama dismissed the women's stories, calling the article "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot". Some officials, like Jim Ziegler, justified Moore's actions, saying they were not "immoral or illegal", and even compared him to the biblical Joseph. Others, like Jerry Pow, said they would still vote for Moore even if the allegations were true, as they didn't want to vote for his Democratic opponent. The responses have sparked outrage, with many calling out the officials for their morally bankrupt defense of Moore's alleged actions. END OF SUMMARY.
