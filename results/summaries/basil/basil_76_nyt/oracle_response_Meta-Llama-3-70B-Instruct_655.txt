SUMMARY:

Republican officials in Alabama have staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations include kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old girl, as well as pursuing three other girls between 16 and 18 years old. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and a "desperate political attack." However, many Alabama Republicans have dismissed the women's stories, calling them "contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot." Some have even sought to justify Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph and claiming that the women's claims are "much ado about nothing." Others have said they would continue to support Moore even if the allegations were true, with one official saying he would vote for Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. The responses have been met with widespread backlash and criticism.
