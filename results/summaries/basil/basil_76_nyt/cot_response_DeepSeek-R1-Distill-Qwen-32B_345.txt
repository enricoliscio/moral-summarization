Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed query with specific steps, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. That means looking for words that carry moral judgment or evaluation. Words like "defended," "sexual advances," "kissing," "undressing," "touching," "pursued," "false," "desperate," "political attack," "partisan plot," "garbage," "nothing," "immoral," "illegal," "contrived," "shenanigans," "predatory," "prosecute," "victims," "sex crime," "rape," and "good decisions." Each of these words carries a moral connotation, either positive or negative.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Republican officials defending Roy Moore despite the allegations, the nature of the allegations, Moore's denial, the officials' reactions, and the comparison to Joseph. I'll ensure that the moral terms are included to reflect the original framing.

I should also keep the summary clear and factual, while incorporating the moral language. I'll structure it to first mention the defense, then the allegations, Moore's response, the officials' dismissals, and the comparison. Finally, I'll note the differing opinions among the officials regarding support for Moore.

Let me make sure I'm not adding any new information or altering the facts, just condensing while preserving the moral elements. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll format it correctly with the specified tokens.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republican officials in Alabama defended Roy S. Moore, their Senate nominee, after reports surfaced that he made sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post detailed allegations of Moore, then a district attorney, kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old girl, as well as pursuing other teenagers. Moore denied the claims, calling them "completely false" and a "desperate political attack" by Democrats. Alabama Republicans dismissed the allegations, with some calling them "total contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." Officials like Jim Ziegler argued Moore's actions were not "immoral or illegal," comparing him to biblical Joseph. Others, like Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore even if he committed a sex crime. Some, like Riley Seibenhener, criticized the allegations but claimed Moore was not guilty of "forcible rape," adding that "14-year-olds donâ€™t make good decisions." The story sparked a partisan divide, with Republicans accusing Democrats of orchestrating a "political attack." END OF SUMMARY.
