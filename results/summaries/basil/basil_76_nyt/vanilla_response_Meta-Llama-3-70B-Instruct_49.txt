SUMMARY:

Republican officials in Alabama are defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, kissed, undressed, and touched a 14-year-old girl, and pursued three other girls aged 16-18. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack" by Democrats. Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, calling the article a partisan plot. Some officials, including the state auditor, justified Moore's actions, with one comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Others said they would still vote for Moore even if the allegations were true. Only one official said he would not support Moore if the allegations were true, but added that Moore was not guilty of "forcible rape".
