SUMMARY:

Republican officials in Alabama are defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report accused him of making sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, had approached a 14-year-old girl and initiated sexual contact. Three other women also came forward with similar allegations. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack" by Democrats. However, several Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, calling the article a partisan plot. Some officials, including the state auditor, justified Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Others said they would still support Moore even if the allegations were true. The controversy comes ahead of a special election next month, where Moore will face Democrat Doug Jones.
