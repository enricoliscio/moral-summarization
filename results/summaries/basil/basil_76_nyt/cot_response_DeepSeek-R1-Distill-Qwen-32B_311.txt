Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed article about Roy Moore and the Republican officials defending him. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I have to write a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "defended," "sexual advances," "kissing," "undressing," "touching," "pursued," "false," "political attack," "backlash," "dismissing," "partisan plot," "contrived media garbage," "nothing," "immoral," "illegal," "predatory," "victim," "prosecute," "sex crime," "good decisions." These words highlight the moral issues discussed.

Next, I'll craft a summary that includes these terms. I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll start by stating that Alabama Republicans defended Moore despite the allegations. I'll mention the specific actions reported and Moore's denial. Then, I'll outline the officials' reactions, their dismissal of the claims, and their justification using biblical references. I'll also note the differing opinions among party members, some supporting Moore regardless, while others question the timing of the allegations.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without losing the moral framing. I'll make sure to mention the legal implications and the comparison to Joseph, as that's a significant moral justification used by the officials. Finally, I'll conclude by noting the ongoing support despite the controversy.

I should double-check to ensure I haven't missed any morally charged words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while preserving the ethical dimensions discussed.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after reports surfaced that he made sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post detailed allegations of Moore kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old girl, as well as pursuing other underage girls. Moore denied the claims, calling them "completely false" and a "political attack." Alabama Republicans largely dismissed the accusations, with some labeling them "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." Officials like Jim Ziegler justified Moore’s actions, comparing him to biblical figures, and accused the Democrats of orchestrating the story. Some party members, including Bibb County chairman Jerry Pow, vowed to support Moore even if he committed a sex crime, while others, like Geneva County chairman Riley Seibenhener, questioned the timing of the allegations. The controversy highlights the ongoing division over Moore’s candidacy in the upcoming election.
