SUMMARY: Alabama Republican officials defended Senate nominee Roy Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct with minors surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Moore had pursued four teenage girls when he was in his 30s, including a 14-year-old whom he kissed and touched inappropriately. Despite the detailed accounts and corroboration by The Post, Alabama Republicans dismissed the allegations as a partisan plot. Some officials called the claims "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing," with one official justifying Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Others stated they would continue to support Moore even if he had committed a sex crime, while a few said they would only withdraw support if proof of guilt was presented or if the allegations involved forcible rape. The article highlights the immediate backlash and defensive stance taken by Alabama Republicans in response to the allegations against their party's nominee.
