SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican officials have staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had made sexual advances toward four teenagers when he was in his 30s, including kissing and touching a 14-year-old girl. Despite the detailed accounts of the women involved and the corroboration by The Post, Alabama Republicans have dismissed the allegations as "total contrived media garbage" and a partisan plot by Democrats. Some officials have even gone so far as to justify Mr. Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph and downplaying the seriousness of the accusations, with one official calling it "much ado about nothing." Others have stated that they would continue to support Mr. Moore even if he were guilty of a sex crime, refusing to acknowledge the immorality and illegality of his actions. This defense of Mr. Moore raises serious moral questions about the values and judgment of Alabama's Republican leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
