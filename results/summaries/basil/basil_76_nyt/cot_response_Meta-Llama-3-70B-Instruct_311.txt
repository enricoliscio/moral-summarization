SUMMARY:
Republican officials in Alabama are staunchly defending their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations are "completely false" and a "desperate political attack" according to Moore. However, the report details how Moore approached a 14-year-old, kissing her, undressing her, and guiding her hand to touch him. Three other women have also come forward, saying they were pursued by Moore when they were between 16 and 18 years old. Alabama Republicans have dismissed the women's stories, calling the article a "contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot." Some have even justified Moore's actions, saying they were not "immoral or illegal." Others have stated that they would still support Moore even if the allegations were true, with one official saying that a 14-year-old "dont't make good decisions." The defense of Moore's actions has sparked outrage, with many calling it a "predatory" and "guilty" behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
