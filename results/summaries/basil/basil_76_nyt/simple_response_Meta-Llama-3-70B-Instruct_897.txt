SUMMARY:

Republican officials in Alabama are defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite allegations that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include a 14-year-old girl who was kissed, undressed, and touched by Moore. Three other women have come forward with similar stories. Instead of condemning Moore's actions, many Alabama Republicans have dismissed the allegations as a "partisan plot" and "total contrived media garbage." Some have even justified Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph and implying that the women were to blame for not coming forward sooner. This morally reprehensible response from Alabama Republicans is a stark reminder that some individuals are more concerned with protecting their party's interests than with standing up against sexual misconduct and supporting victims of abuse.
