SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Roy Moore, their party's nominee for Senate, after allegations of sexual misconduct with four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore kissed a 14-year-old, undressed her, touched her inappropriately, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. Three other women shared similar stories of being pursued by Moore when they were 16-18 years old. Moore denied the allegations as a "desperate political attack." Alabama Republicans largely dismissed the claims, with some calling it a partisan plot. John Skipper, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, called it "total contrived media garbage." State auditor Jim Ziegler justified Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying that Moore had done nothing "immoral or illegal." Some officials said they would continue to support Moore even if the allegations were true. Others dismissed the story as a Democratic trick. The article raises questions about the morality of Moore's actions and the response of Alabama Republicans, with some officials seemingly justifying or minimizing sexual misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
