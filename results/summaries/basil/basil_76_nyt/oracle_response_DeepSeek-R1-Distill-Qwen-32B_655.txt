Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I'll start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Republican officials in Alabama defending Roy Moore against allegations of making sexual advances to teenage girls in the 70s. Moore is the Senate nominee, and the Democrats are his opponents. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old and engaged in several sexual acts. Three other women came forward with similar stories. Moore denies the allegations, calling them a political attack. Republican officials are dismissing the claims, some even justifying Moore's actions, comparing them to biblical figures.

I need to make sure to include the moral words like "advances," "approached," "kissing," "undressing," "touching," etc. Also, words like "dismissed," "contrived," "characterized," "support," "assertion," "contact," "abuse," "justify," "actions," "comparing," "back," "crime," "change," "rape."

I'll structure the summary to first state the defense of Moore by Republicans, mention the allegations, Moore's denial, the reactions from officials, their dismissal of the claims, and their justifications. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, using the morally framed words where appropriate.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and factual, reflecting the moral perspective presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after reports emerged of his alleged sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post detailed claims that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old girl, kissed her, undressed her, and touched her over her bra and underpants. Three other women also accused him of pursuing them when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack" by Democrats. Alabama Republicans largely dismissed the women's stories, with some calling the report "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." Officials like Jim Ziegler justified Moore's actions, comparing him to biblical figures, while others, like Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore even if he committed a sex crime. Some, like Riley Seibenhener, rejected the allegations of forcible rape but still criticized the women. The article highlights the moral framing of the situation, with terms like "advances," "approached," "touching," "pursued," "dismissed," and "justified" reflecting the ethical and legal implications of the claims. END OF SUMMARY.
