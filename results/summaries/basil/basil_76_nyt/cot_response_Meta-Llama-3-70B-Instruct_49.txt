SUMMARY:
Republican officials in Alabama are staunchly defending their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and a "desperate political attack." However, many Republicans in Alabama dismissed the women's stories out of hand, calling the article "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot." Some officials, like Jim Ziegler, justified Moore's actions, saying they were not "immoral or illegal" and comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Others, like Jerry Pow, said they would still vote for Moore even if the allegations were true, while Riley Seibenhener said that if the allegations were true, he would not support the candidate, but added that Moore was not guilty of "forcible rape." The officials' responses have sparked outrage and raised questions about their moral standards. END OF SUMMARY.
