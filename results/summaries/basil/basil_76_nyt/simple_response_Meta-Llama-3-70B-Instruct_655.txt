SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials have rallied around their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite allegations that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The officials have dismissed the women's stories, calling the report a "partisan plot" and "contrived media garbage." Some have even justified Moore's actions, with one official comparing him to the biblical Joseph, who married a teenage Mary. Others have said they would still vote for Moore even if the allegations were true, with one official stating that a 14-year-old "don't make good decisions." The officials' responses have been met with outrage, as they have chosen to defend their candidate rather than condemning his alleged actions. This moral failure is a stark reminder of the importance of standing up against sexual misconduct and believing survivors of abuse.
