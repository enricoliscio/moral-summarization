SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials have rallied around their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite allegations that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The officials have dismissed the women's stories as "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot" by the Democratic Party. Some have even justified Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph and implying that the women were not victims because they didn't come forward sooner. Others have said they would still vote for Moore even if the allegations were true. The officials' responses have been met with outrage, as they seem to be prioritizing party loyalty over the well-being of the alleged victims. The moral implications of their responses are disturbing, as they appear to be condoning and justifying sexual misconduct towards minors. END OF SUMMARY.
