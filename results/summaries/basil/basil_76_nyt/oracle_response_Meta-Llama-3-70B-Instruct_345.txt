SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials have staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report revealed he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations include kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old, as well as pursuing three other girls aged 16-18. Despite the disturbing claims, many Republicans dismissed the women's stories, calling them "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot." Alabama's state auditor, Jim Ziegler, sought to justify Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph and claiming the women's claims were "much ado about nothing." Others, like Jerry Pow, said they would still support Moore even if he committed a sex crime. The officials' responses have sparked outrage, with many criticizing their attempts to downplay and justify Moore's alleged abuse. END OF SUMMARY.
