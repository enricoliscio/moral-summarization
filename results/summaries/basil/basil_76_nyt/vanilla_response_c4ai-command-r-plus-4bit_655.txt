SUMMARY: Alabama Republican officials defended Senate nominee Roy Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct with four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore had kissed and touched a 14-year-old girl and that three other women had similar experiences with him around the same time. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a political attack. Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the claims, some calling them a Democratic plot despite the detailed reporting and corroboration. State auditor Jim Ziegler called the claims "much ado about nothing," and others said they would continue to support Moore even if the allegations were true. Some officials expressed skepticism about the timing of the accusations, while others suggested that Moore's actions were not immoral or illegal. The responses highlight a stark partisan divide in the interpretation of the allegations and the willingness to accept or dismiss them.
