Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing the news article they provided, making sure to preserve the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republican officials in Alabama defending Roy Moore against allegations of making sexual advances towards teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported on these claims, and Moore denied them, calling it a political attack. Republicans dismissed the women's stories, some calling it a partisan plot. Some officials even justified Moore's actions, comparing them to biblical figures.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list that are present in the article. Words like "advances," "approached," "kissing," "undressing," "touching," "guiding," "pursued," "dismissed," "called," "contrived," "characterized," "continue," "support," "echoed," "assertion," "pulled," "said," "contact," "abuse," "sought," "justify," "actions," "comparing," "back," "crime," "change," "rape."

I should structure the summary to include these words while maintaining the moral tone. I'll start by stating that Republican officials defended Moore after the report. Then, mention the specific allegations from the Washington Post, using words like "approached," "kissing," "undressing," etc. Include Moore's denial and the party's dismissal of the claims, using terms like "contrived," "characterized," "assertion." Then, note the officials' justifications, using "justify," "actions," "comparing," and mention the comparison to Joseph and Mary. Also, include that some officials would support Moore even if he committed a sex crime, using "back," "crime." Finally, mention the state auditor's comments about the statute of limitations, using "contact," "abuse," and "rape."

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and includes the necessary moral framing words without making it too wordy. Also, I should end the summary with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after reports emerged that he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls in the late 1970s. The Washington Post detailed allegations that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old, kissed her, undressed her, touched her over her bra and underpants, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. Three other women also claimed Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and a "desperate political attack." Alabama Republicans dismissed the women’s stories, with some calling the report "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." Officials echoed Moore’s assertion that the claims were a partisan plot by Democrats. Alabama state auditor Jim Ziegler sought to justify Moore’s actions, comparing him to biblical figures, and argued that 40 years later, the women could not be considered victims. Some party officials, including Bibb County chairman Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore even if he committed a sex crime, while others dismissed the story as a Democratic trick. END OF SUMMARY.
