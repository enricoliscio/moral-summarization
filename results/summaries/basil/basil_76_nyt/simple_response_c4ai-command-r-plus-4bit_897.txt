SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama have defended their Senate nominee Roy Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct with minors surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s, including a 14-year-old girl. Despite the detailed accounts and corroboration by The Post, Alabama Republicans have dismissed the women's stories and claimed the report is a partisan plot by Democrats. Some officials have even gone as far as justifying Mr. Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph. The responses reveal a disturbing moral framing, with one official stating he would vote for Mr. Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. Others refuse to acknowledge the allegations as anything more than a political trick. This summary highlights the immoral and unjustifiable defense of a politician accused of sexual misconduct with minors by his own party members.
