SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama have defended Roy S. Moore, their party's Senate nominee, after accusations of sexual misconduct with minors surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore, then in his 30s, had kissed a 14-year-old girl, undressed her, and touched her inappropriately. Despite the detailed accounts of the victims and the reporters' corroboration of the allegations, many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories as a partisan plot by the Democrats. Some officials went as far as justifying Mr. Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph, and blaming the victims for not coming forward sooner. Others expressed their continued support for Mr. Moore even if he had committed a sex crime, while a few stated that they would only withdraw their support if the allegations of forcible rape were proven true. This response from Republican officials raises serious moral concerns about the value placed on women's voices, the protection of minors, and the integrity of political parties.
