SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report surfaced alleging that he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore approached a 14-year-old and kissed, undressed, and touched her, and that he pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. Mr. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack." Several Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, with some characterizing the report as a partisan plot. Some officials, such as John Skipper, called it "total contrived media garbage," while others, like Alabama's state auditor, Jim Ziegler, sought to justify Mr. Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Despite the allegations, many Republican officials in the state continued to support Mr. Moore, with some saying they would vote for him even if he had committed a sex crime. Others dismissed the story as a Democratic trick, showing a blatant disregard for the moral implications of the accusations.
END OF SUMMARY.
