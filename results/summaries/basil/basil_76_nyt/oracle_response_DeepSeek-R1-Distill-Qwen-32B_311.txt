Alright, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses Republican officials in Alabama defending Roy Moore after allegations of sexual advances towards teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, made advances towards a 14-year-old and others. Moore denies the claims, calling them a political attack. Some officials dismiss the allegations, calling them "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." They support Moore despite the claims, with one even saying he'd vote for Moore even if he committed a sex crime. Others compare Moore's actions to biblical figures, justifying his behavior.

I need to include words like "advances," "approached," "kissing," "undressing," "touching," "guiding," "pursued," "dismissed," "called," "contrived," "characterized," "continue," "support," "echoed," "assertion," "pulled," "said," "contact," "abuse," "sought," "justify," "actions," "comparing," "back," "crime," "change," "rape."

I should structure the summary to highlight the defense by Republicans, their dismissal of the allegations, and the moral justifications used. I'll make sure to include the key points: Moore's denial, the officials' support despite the claims, the comparison to Joseph, and the refusal to change support even with proof. I'll keep it under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral language.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after reports emerged that he made sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post detailed allegations that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old, kissed her, undressed her, and touched her over her underwear. Three other women also claimed Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the claims, calling them a "desperate political attack." Alabama Republicans dismissed the women’s stories, with some calling the article "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." Officials echoed Moore’s assertion that the claims were a Democratic plot. Alabama state auditor Jim Ziegler justified Moore’s actions by comparing him to biblical Joseph, stating, "Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus." Some officials, including Bibb County party chairman Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. Others, like Covington County chairman William Blocker, dismissed the story as a Democratic trick, even if proof existed. The article highlights the moral and political divide surrounding the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
