Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article. The article is about Republican officials in Alabama defending Roy S. Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The user provided the full article, and they want a concise summary of 200 words or less, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. The key elements are:

1. Republican officials defending Roy Moore.
2. Allegations from The Washington Post about Moore making sexual advances to four teenage girls in the 1970s.
3. Moore's response dismissing the allegations as a political attack.
4. The upcoming special election against Doug Jones.
5. Reactions from various Alabama officials, some dismissing the claims as media garbage or partisan plots, others justifying Moore's actions or stating they'd support him regardless.

I should structure the summary to include these points succinctly. I'll need to mention the allegations, Moore's denial, the election context, and the varied responses from officials, including specific quotes if possible, but without making it too lengthy.

I also need to ensure that the summary is within 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main events and then condense them into a coherent summary. I'll make sure to mention the key players, the nature of the allegations, and the reactions, keeping it factual and concise.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it flows well and covers all critical aspects without unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that it starts and ends with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after reports surfaced that he made sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post detailed allegations that Moore, then a district attorney, engaged in inappropriate behavior with a 14-year-old and pursued other underage girls. Moore denied the claims, calling them a political attack. The story sparked backlash from Alabama Republicans, who dismissed the women’s accounts as fabrications or partisan tactics. Some officials, like former Mobile County Republican Party chairman John Skipper, labeled the claims "total contrived media garbage." Alabama state auditor Jim Ziegler claimed Moore’s actions were "not immoral or illegal," drawing comparisons to biblical figures. Others, including Bibb County party chairman Jerry Pow, vowed to support Moore regardless of the allegations. The article highlights the polarized reactions to the story as Moore prepares to face Democratic candidate Doug Jones in a special election. END OF SUMMARY.
