SUMMARY:

Republican officials in Alabama are defending their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite allegations that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, kissed, undressed, and touched a 14-year-old girl, and pursued three other girls between 16 and 18 years old. Instead of condemning Moore's actions, many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories as "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot" by the Democratic Party. Some even justified Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph and claiming that the women's claims were "much ado about nothing." These officials' responses are morally reprehensible, as they prioritize party loyalty over the well-being and dignity of the alleged victims. By defending Moore's actions, they are perpetuating a culture of victim-blaming and enabling sexual misconduct.
