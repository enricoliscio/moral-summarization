SUMMARY:

Republican officials in Alabama have staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report revealed that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations include kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old girl, as well as pursuing three other girls between 16 and 18 years old. Despite the disturbing nature of these actions, many Alabama Republicans have dismissed the women's stories, calling them "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot" by the Democratic Party. Some officials have even sought to justify Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph and claiming that the women's claims are "much ado about nothing." Others have said they would continue to support Moore even if the allegations are true, with one official stating that he would vote for Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. The responses from these officials are a stark contrast to the seriousness of the allegations and the harm caused to the victims.
