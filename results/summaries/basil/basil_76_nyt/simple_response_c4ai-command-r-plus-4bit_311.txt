SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama are facing backlash for their defense of Roy S. Moore, the party's Senate nominee, after allegations of sexual misconduct with minors surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s and pursued three other teenage girls around the same time. Despite the detailed accounts and corroboration by The Post, many Alabama Republicans, including John Skipper, the former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, dismissed the claims as a partisan plot by Democrats. Several officials made immoral and insensitive remarks, downplaying the seriousness of the allegations and justifying Mr. Moore's actions with inappropriate comparisons. Some even stated that they would continue to support Mr. Moore even if the allegations were true, prioritizing political allegiance over ethical conduct. This response highlights a disturbing lack of moral compass and a disregard for the well-being of victims of sexual misconduct.
