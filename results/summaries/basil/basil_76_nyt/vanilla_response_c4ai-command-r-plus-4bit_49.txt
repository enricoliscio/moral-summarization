SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Senate, after allegations surfaced that he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore had kissed a 14-year-old girl, undressed her, and touched her inappropriately. The paper also found three other women who said they had been pursued by Moore around the same time when they were 16-18 years old. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a political attack by Democrats. Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, with some calling the article a partisan plot. Several officials made controversial statements in Moore's defense, including comparing him to the biblical Joseph and Mary. Some said they would continue to support Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. Others, however, stated that if the allegations were true, they would not support Moore. The responses highlight the divide among Republicans in Alabama regarding the allegations against Moore.
