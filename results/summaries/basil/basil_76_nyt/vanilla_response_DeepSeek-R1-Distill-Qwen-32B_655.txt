Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow them closely.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republican officials in Alabama defending Roy S. Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post reported on this, and Moore denied the claims, calling them a political attack. The article also mentions the upcoming special election against Doug Jones, a Democrat, and the reactions from various Republican officials.

I need to condense this information into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include key details like Moore's position, the nature of the allegations, his response, the reactions from party officials, and the political context of the election.

I should start by introducing Moore and the allegations, then mention his denial. Next, I'll highlight the support from Republican officials and their dismissals of the claims. It's important to note their arguments and any comparisons they made, like the biblical reference. Finally, I'll mention the upcoming election and the split within the party regarding the allegations.

I need to keep the summary concise, sticking to the main points without getting bogged down in too many details. Also, I must ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure the summary step by step:

1. Introduce Moore and the allegations.
2. Mention his denial and the political angle he suggested.
3. Describe the support from Republican officials and their reasons.
4. Note the comparison to Joseph and Mary, and the dismissal of the claims.
5. Highlight the upcoming election and the split within the party.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and factual. Let me make sure the word count is within the limit. I'll count the words after drafting to ensure compliance.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama have defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after allegations emerged that he made sexual advances toward teenage girls in the 1970s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, allegedly kissed, undressed, and touched a 14-year-old girl, as well as pursued three other teenage girls. Moore denied the claims, calling them a "desperate political attack" by Democrats. Alabama Republicans largely dismissed the allegations, with some calling the report "contrived media garbage" and others claiming it was a partisan plot. Some officials, including Alabama's state auditor, Jim Ziegler, argued that Moore's actions were not immoral or illegal, comparing him to Joseph and Mary in the Bible. Others, like Bibb County party chairman Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore even if he were guilty of a sex crime. The story has sparked a split within the Republican party, with some, like Geneva County chairman Riley Seibenhener, stating they would not support Moore if the allegations were true. Moore is set to face Democrat Doug Jones in a special election next month. END OF SUMMARY.
