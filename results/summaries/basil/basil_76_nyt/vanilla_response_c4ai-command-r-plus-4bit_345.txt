SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy Moore after a report surfaced alleging he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a political attack. Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, with some calling the report a partisan plot. Some officials, such as former Mobile County Republican Party chairman John Skipper, characterized the claims as "total contrived media garbage," while others like state auditor Jim Ziegler justified Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph. A few Republican officials in the state expressed skepticism about the allegations, but most continued to support Moore, even if they believed the claims to be true.
END OF SUMMARY.
