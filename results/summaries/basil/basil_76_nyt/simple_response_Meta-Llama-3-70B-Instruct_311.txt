SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials have rallied around their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, despite a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The officials have dismissed the women's stories, calling them "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot" by the Democratic Party. Some have even justified Moore's actions, with one official comparing him to the biblical Joseph and saying that the women's claims are "much ado about nothing." Others have said they would still support Moore even if the allegations were true, with one official stating that he wouldn't want to vote for the Democratic opponent instead. The moral implications of these responses are alarming, as they seem to prioritize party loyalty over the well-being and dignity of the alleged victims.
