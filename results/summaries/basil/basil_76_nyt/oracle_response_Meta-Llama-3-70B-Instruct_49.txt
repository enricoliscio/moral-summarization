SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report revealed he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations included kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old, as well as pursuing three other girls between 16 and 18 years old. Despite the disturbing claims, many Republicans dismissed the women's stories as "total contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot" by the Democratic Party. Some officials, like Jim Ziegler, sought to justify Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying "Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter." Others, like Jerry Pow, said they would still support Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. The officials' responses sparked outrage, with many criticizing their willingness to condone and justify Moore's alleged abuse. END OF SUMMARY.
