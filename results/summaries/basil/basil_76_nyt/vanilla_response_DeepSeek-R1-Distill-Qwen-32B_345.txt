Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore and the Republican officials' reactions. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article talks about how Republican officials in Alabama are defending Roy Moore after The Washington Post reported that he made sexual advances towards teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The report includes specific allegations from four women, and The Post interviewed over 30 people. Moore denies the claims, calling them a political attack by Democrats.

Now, looking at the officials' responses: some are dismissing the allegations outright, calling the story "media garbage" or a partisan plot. Others, like Jim Ziegler, compare Moore's actions to biblical figures, downplaying the severity. Some even say they'd support Moore regardless of the truth. The article also mentions that Alabama's laws consider such actions illegal, but some officials don't see it that way.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the defense from Alabama Republicans, mention the allegations from The Post, Moore's denial, and the officials' reactions. I'll highlight key points like comparing to Joseph, the legal perspective, and the support despite the allegations.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, capturing the main events and reactions without getting too detailed. Also, I need to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Senate nominee Roy S. Moore after The Washington Post reported allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls in the late 1970s. The Post interviewed over 30 people, including four women who accused Moore of making advances when they were between 14 and 18. Moore denied the claims, calling them a "political attack." Alabama Republicans dismissed the allegations, with some calling the story "media garbage" or a partisan plot. State auditor Jim Ziegler compared Moore to biblical figures, downplaying the severity of the actions. Others, like Bibb County chairman Jerry Pow, said they would support Moore regardless of the allegations. Despite legal definitions of such actions as illegal, some officials questioned the credibility of the women's claims. The special election against Democrat Doug Jones remains a焦点. END OF SUMMARY.
