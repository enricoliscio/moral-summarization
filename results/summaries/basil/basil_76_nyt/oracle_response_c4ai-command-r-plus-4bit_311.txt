SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he had made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore had kissed a 14-year-old, undressed her, touched her, and guided her hand to touch him. The paper also found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time when they were 16-18 years old. Mr. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack." Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, with some calling the article a partisan plot. Several officials characterized the claims as "contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing." They continued to support their candidate, with some even saying they would back Mr. Moore even if he had committed a sex crime. Others dismissed the story as a Democratic trick and said they would not change their minds even with proof of Mr. Moore's guilt. The moral framing in the article centers around the alleged sexual misconduct of Mr. Moore, with words like "advances," "pursued," "undressed," and "touched" used to describe his actions. The responses from Republican officials are also framed in moral terms, with words like "dismissed," "contrived," and "justified" used to describe their defense of Mr. Moore.
END OF SUMMARY.
