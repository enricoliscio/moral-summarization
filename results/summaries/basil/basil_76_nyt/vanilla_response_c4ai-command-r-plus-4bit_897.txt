SUMMARY: Alabama Republican officials defended Roy Moore, their party's Senate nominee, after allegations of sexual misconduct with four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post's report included an account from a 14-year-old girl who said Moore kissed her, undressed her, and touched her inappropriately. Three other women shared similar stories. Moore denied the allegations as "completely false" and a "political attack." Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the claims, with some calling it a Democratic plot. State auditor Jim Ziegler called the allegations "much ado about nothing," while others said they would continue to support Moore even if he committed a sex crime. The responses sparked backlash, with critics arguing that the officials were minimizing the allegations and engaging in partisan defense.
