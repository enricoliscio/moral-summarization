SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama are facing backlash for their defense of Roy S. Moore, the party's Senate nominee, after allegations of sexual misconduct with minors surfaced. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore, then in his 30s, had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls, including a 14-year-old. Despite the detailed accounts and corroboration by The Post, many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, claiming they were part of a partisan plot by Democrats. Some officials even went as far as justifying Mr. Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, while others stated they would continue to support him even if he had committed a sex crime. The moral character of these officials is being questioned as they prioritize political allegiance over the well-being of vulnerable minors and the pursuit of justice.
