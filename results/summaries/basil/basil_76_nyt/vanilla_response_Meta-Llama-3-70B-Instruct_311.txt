SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials are defending their Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report alleged he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then a district attorney, approached a 14-year-old girl and engaged in inappropriate behavior. Three other women also came forward with similar allegations. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "desperate political attack" by Democrats. However, several Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, calling the article a partisan plot. Some officials, including the state auditor, justified Moore's actions, comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Others said they would continue to support Moore even if the allegations were true. The special election is set for next month, with Moore facing Democrat Doug Jones.
