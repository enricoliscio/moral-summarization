SUMMARY:
Republican officials in Alabama have staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and a "desperate political attack." Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the women's stories, with some calling the article a "contrived media garbage" and a "partisan plot." State Auditor Jim Ziegler justified Moore's actions, saying they were not "immoral or illegal," and compared him to the biblical Joseph. However, others, like Riley Seibenhener, said they would not support Moore if the allegations were true, but also downplayed the severity of the actions, saying they did not constitute "forcible rape." The controversy has sparked a heated debate, with many questioning the morality of Moore's actions and the responses of Alabama Republicans. END OF SUMMARY.
