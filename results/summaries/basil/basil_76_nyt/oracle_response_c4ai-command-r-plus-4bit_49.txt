SUMMARY: Republican officials in Alabama defended Roy S. Moore, their party's Senate nominee, after allegations of sexual misconduct with four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Moore approached a 14-year-old and kissed, undressed, and touched her, and that he pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. Mr. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a political attack. Many Alabama Republicans dismissed the claims, with some characterizing them as a partisan plot by Democrats. Some officials, such as John Skipper, called the story "total contrived media garbage," while others, like Jim Ziegler, justified Mr. Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Despite the allegations, most officials continued to support Mr. Moore, with some stating they would back him even if he had committed a sex crime. The responses highlight a moral dilemma, as some prioritize party loyalty over the pursuit of justice and the well-being of victims.
