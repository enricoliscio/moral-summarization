SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican officials staunchly defended their party's Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he made sexual advances towards four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The allegations include kissing, undressing, and touching a 14-year-old, and pursuing three other girls between 16 and 18 years old. Moore dismissed the allegations as "completely false" and a "desperate political attack." However, several Republican officials in Alabama characterized the claims as "total contrived media garbage" and "much ado about nothing," and sought to justify Moore's actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph. Some officials, including Jerry Pow, said they would continue to support Moore even if the allegations were true, while others, like Riley Seibenhener, said they would not support him if the allegations were true, but claimed that Moore was not guilty of "forcible rape." The officials' responses sparked immediate backlash, with many criticizing their dismissal of the women's stories and justification of Moore's actions.
