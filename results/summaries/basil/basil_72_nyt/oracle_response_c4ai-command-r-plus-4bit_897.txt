SUMMARY: President Trump is facing pressure to choose a new F.B.I. director, a critical hire to restore the agency's morale and independence after the sudden firing of James B. Comey. Trump named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist, but his staff has urged him to take more time to make the decision. Lieberman, a political operator with no federal law enforcement experience, has raised concerns among some in the White House due to his age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump, however, seems to cherish Lieberman's bipartisan reputation and good chemistry with him, indicating that the decision is "very close." Other contenders include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all with law enforcement backgrounds. The White House is divided, with some advisers suggesting an insider hire to repair the damage caused by Comey's ouster. The president's acknowledgment of Lieberman as a finalist has stoked speculation, but it is unclear whether this is a deliberate strategy. Trump's pick must navigate a Senate confirmation process, with Democrats pushing back on Lieberman as a true Democrat. The choice of F.B.I. director is a crucial decision for Trump, as the agency's reputation has been damaged by leaks and political controversies during the recent election campaigns.
END OF SUMMARY.
