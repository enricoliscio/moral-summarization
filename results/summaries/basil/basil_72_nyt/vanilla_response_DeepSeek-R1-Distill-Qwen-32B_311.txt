Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump selecting a new FBI director. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Trump is close to choosing a successor for James Comey and mentions Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. Lieberman is a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, which is interesting because he's a Democrat, and Trump is a Republican. Also, Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience, which some of Trump's staff are concerned about. They want him to take more time, but Trump might leave without picking someone before his trip.

The article mentions that Lieberman is a political operator and his selection would be unusual for the FBI, which typically picks judges or former prosecutors, not elected officials. The process is kept secret to avoid leaks, which Trump believes are common in the White House.

Trump emphasized that the FBI is special and mentioned the reputation issues from the Clinton and Trump campaigns. He's considering Lieberman, but also other candidates like Adam Lee, Richard McFeely, and Andrew McCabe, who is the acting director. McCabe has experience in Russian organized crime, which might be relevant.

Democrats are against Lieberman, seeing him as a conservative Democrat, and they note he supported Trump's pick for national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Republicans like John McCain support Lieberman, thinking it's better than the current situation.

The White House is divided; some advisors are worried about Lieberman's age (75) and potential conflicts of interest because he works with Trump's lawyer. If Trump picks him, Lieberman might serve a short term to boost Trump's credibility.

Other candidates include Frank Keating and Mike Rogers, both Republicans, with Rogers being a former FBI agent and endorsed by agents' associations. Judges Michael Garcia and Henry Hudson were also interviewed.

So, the summary should include Trump's consideration of Lieberman despite concerns, the unusual choice given FBI traditions, the internal debate within the administration, and the other candidates being considered. It should also touch on the political implications and possible conflicts.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, making sure to highlight the key points: Trump's finalists, concerns about Lieberman, other candidates, and the political dynamics involved.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his deadline for selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a leading finalist despite concerns about his lack of law enforcement experience and political ties. Trump's staff has urged caution, but he appeared close to making a decision, though he might leave without choosing a successor before his foreign trip. Lieberman, a political operator with no federal law enforcement background, would be an unconventional pick for the FBI, which traditionally selects judges or former prosecutors. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, former agent Richard McFeely, and special agent Adam Lee. Democrats criticize Lieberman as a conservative Democrat, while Republicans like John McCain support him. The White House is divided, with concerns over Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump may appoint Lieberman for a short term to bolster credibility, though other candidates like Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, are also under consideration. END OF SUMMARY.
