SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump has emphasized the need for a "great" director, as the FBI's reputation has been "damaged" by the Clinton campaign and Comey's firing. Lieberman's bipartisan reputation could lend credibility to Trump, but Democrats are pushing back, casting him as a conservative. Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, who are all under consideration. Trump's decision is expected to be made soon, but it remains unclear if he will choose Lieberman or another candidate. END OF SUMMARY.
