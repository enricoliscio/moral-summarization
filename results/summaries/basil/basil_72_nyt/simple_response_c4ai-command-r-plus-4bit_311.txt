SUMMARY: President Trump, facing a self-imposed deadline for selecting a new F.B.I. director, named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, members of his staff urged him to take more time and consider other candidates, expressing concerns about Mr. Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his political background. Despite this, Trump praised the F.B.I. and emphasized the need for a great director to restore its reputation after the controversies of the 2016 campaigns. The president also mentioned other contenders, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. Mr. Lieberman's potential nomination faced opposition from Democrats, who viewed him as a conservative and questioned his true allegiance. There were also concerns about his age and potential conflicts of interest. The White House remained divided, with some advisers suggesting a short-term appointment for Mr. Lieberman to boost the president's credibility. The list of candidates also included former Gov. Frank Keating and former Rep. Mike Rogers, both Republicans with law enforcement backgrounds. The search for a new F.B.I. director highlighted the importance of finding a qualified and apolitical leader to restore trust in the bureau.
END OF SUMMARY.
