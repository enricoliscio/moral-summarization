SUMMARY: 
President Trump is facing a moral dilemma 24 hours before his self-imposed deadline for selecting a new F.B.I. director. While Trump has named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist, members of his staff are alarmed and have urged him to take more time with this critical hire. They argue that the F.B.I. is one of Washington's few apolitical institutions and that Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience, may not be the ideal choice. Trump, however, seems charmed by Lieberman and has good chemistry with him. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also supports Lieberman, believing he will receive overwhelming support in the Senate. Yet, Democrats are pushing back hard, casting Lieberman as a conservative Democrat in name only. They note his public support for Trump's controversial pick of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. 

Despite the moral dilemma, Trump seems inclined towards Lieberman, appealing to Senator John McCain, who had previously drawn comparisons between the Comey firing and Watergate. Still, the White House remains divided, with senior officials expressing serious doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict-of-interest accusations due to his connection with Trump's lawyer's firm. Trump's other options include former Governor Frank Keating and former Representative Mike Rogers, both Republicans with law enforcement experience. The decision is fluid, and Trump may opt for a lesser-known candidate or someone from within the F.B.I. to repair morale.
