Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump choosing a new FBI director. The article is quite detailed, so I'll have to read through it carefully to extract the key points.

First, the main event is that Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director after firing James Comey. The article mentions Joseph Lieberman as a finalist, which is interesting because he's a former Democratic senator and doesn't have law enforcement experience. That seems unusual for the FBI director role.

I should note that Trump's staff is concerned about his quick decision to choose Lieberman. They think he should take more time, especially since Lieberman is 75 and has no federal law enforcement background. The article also mentions that Trump might leave without making a decision before his trip.

Another important point is that Lieberman is a political figure, which might not be ideal for an FBI director, given the agency's need for independence. The article also talks about other potential candidates like Andrew McCabe, who is the acting director, and others like Richard McFeely and Adam Lee. There's a mention of internal candidates versus external picks.

Additionally, there's political pushback from Democrats, who don't see Lieberman as a true Democrat, especially since he supported Trump's previous national security adviser, Michael Flynn. On the other hand, some Republicans like John McCain support Lieberman.

I should also include the concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest due to his employment with a firm linked to Trump's lawyer. The summary should mention that Trump might only have Lieberman serve a short term for political reasons.

Finally, the article lists other candidates like Frank Keating and Mike Rogers, with Rogers being a former FBI agent and endorsed by the agents' association.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover Trump's consideration of Lieberman despite concerns, the potential candidates, political implications, and the fluid nature of the selection process.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his deadline for selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a finalist despite lacking federal law enforcement experience. Trump's staff has urged him to take more time, as Lieberman, 75, is seen as an unusual choice for the FBI, which typically selects judges or former prosecutors. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, former agent Richard McFeely, and special agent Adam Lee. Trump has also considered former Governor Frank Keating and former Representative Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent. Democrats oppose Lieberman, calling him a Democrat in name only, while Republicans like John McCain support him. Concerns include Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump may choose Lieberman for his bipartisan appeal, possibly for a short term. The decision remains fluid, with Trump potentially leaving for a foreign trip without selecting a director. END OF SUMMARY.
