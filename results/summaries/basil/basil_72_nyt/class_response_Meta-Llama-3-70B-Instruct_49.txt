SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time to make this critical hire, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI's independence is prized by its agents, and Lieberman's political background raises concerns. Trump's sudden firing of James Comey has damaged morale, and some officials suggest hiring from within the agency to repair the damage. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, are still under consideration. Trump's choice will be closely watched, as the FBI's reputation has been tarnished by the controversy surrounding Comey's firing. Trump's acknowledgment of Lieberman as a finalist has sparked speculation, but it remains unclear if he will ultimately choose the former senator. END OF SUMMARY.
