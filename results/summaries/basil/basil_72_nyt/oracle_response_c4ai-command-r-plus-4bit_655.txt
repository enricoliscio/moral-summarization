SUMMARY: President Trump has indicated that he is "very close" to choosing a successor to the recently fired FBI director, James B. Comey. Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, has been named as a finalist, despite concerns from some members of Trump's staff about his lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump's acknowledgment of Lieberman as a finalist has fueled speculation, but other candidates are still under consideration, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe. There are concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest, and some suggest that he may only serve a short stint as FBI director if selected. The White House remains divided on the choice, with some expressing doubts about Lieberman's suitability for the role. The selection of a new FBI director is a critical decision, as the agency's independence and apolitical nature are highly cherished, especially in the wake of Comey's controversial ouster. The president is seeking a candidate with whom he has good chemistry and who will receive strong support in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
