SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a top contender. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time to make a decision, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Despite this, Trump has publicly acknowledged Lieberman as a finalist, praising his "great" reputation. Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have experience within the FBI. Trump is also considering Frank Keating and Mike Rogers, both Republicans. The decision is still fluid, with some officials expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest. Trump's choice may be influenced by his desire for a bipartisan pick to repair the FBI's damaged morale.

END OF SUMMARY.
