SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph Lieberman as a top contender. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Lieberman's nomination has raised concerns among Democrats, who see him as a conservative Democrat who has supported Trump's picks in the past. Some officials also worry about Lieberman's age, 75, and potential conflict of interest due to his employment by a firm where Trump's lawyer works. Trump has praised Lieberman, saying he has "good chemistry" with him, and that he would bring a bipartisan reputation to the role. Despite this, many law enforcement officials believe Trump should choose from within the agency to repair morale damaged by Comey's firing. Other candidates, including Adam Lee, Richard McFeely, and Andrew McCabe, are still in the running.
