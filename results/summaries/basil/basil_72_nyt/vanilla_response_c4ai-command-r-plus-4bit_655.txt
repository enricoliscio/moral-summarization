SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline for selecting a new FBI director, and has named former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist for the position. Lieberman, a 75-year-old conservative Democrat-turned-independent, has no federal law enforcement experience but is seen as a charming political operator with good chemistry with Trump. Some White House staff have urged Trump to take more time with the decision, and it is possible he will leave for a foreign trip without making a selection. Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among some advisers, who suggest he may only serve a short stint if chosen. Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. The White House remains divided on the choice, with some expressing doubts about Lieberman and others citing his bipartisan appeal. Also on the shortlist are former Gov. Frank Keating and former Rep. Mike Rogers, both Republicans with law enforcement backgrounds. Judges Michael J. Garcia and Henry E. Hudson have also been interviewed.
END OF SUMMARY.
