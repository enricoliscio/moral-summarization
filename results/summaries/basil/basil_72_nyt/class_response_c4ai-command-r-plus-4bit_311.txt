SUMMARY: President Trump is very close to choosing a successor to James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, and has named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist. However, some members of Trumpâ€™s staff have urged him to take more time with this critical hire, as Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience. Lieberman, who served in the Senate as a Democrat and an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., an organization that values its independence from politics. Trump, however, seems drawn to Lieberman's charm and political experience, as well as his potential for bipartisan support. There are concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest due to his law firm connections. Other candidates on Trump's list include former law enforcement officials and judges. The F.B.I. is in need of repair after the damage caused by Comey's firing, and Trump is seeking a director who can restore the agency's reputation.

END OF SUMMARY.
