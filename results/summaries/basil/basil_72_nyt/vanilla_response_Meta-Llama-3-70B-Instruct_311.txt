SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time to make the decision, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Despite this, Trump has publicly acknowledged Lieberman as a finalist, praising his bipartisan reputation. Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. Trump is seeking a candidate who can repair the damage to morale caused by James Comey's firing. Democrats are pushing back against Lieberman's potential nomination, citing his conservative views and lack of support from party members. The White House remains divided on the issue, with some officials expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest.

END OF SUMMARY.
