SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph Lieberman emerging as a finalist. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Lieberman's selection would be unorthodox, as FBI directors are typically judges or former prosecutors, not elected officials. Trump's decision-making process is being kept secret to avoid leaks, but he has praised Lieberman, saying they had good chemistry. Democrats are pushing back against Lieberman's potential nomination, citing his conservative views and support for Trump's national security adviser. The White House is divided, with some officials expressing concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest. Other candidates, including current FBI officials and judges, are still being considered.

END OF SUMMARY.
