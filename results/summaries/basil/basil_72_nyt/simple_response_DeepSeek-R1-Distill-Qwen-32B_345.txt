Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert. The article is about President Trump's process of selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. 

First, I need to understand the key points. Trump is close to choosing a successor for Comey, and Lieberman is a finalist despite having no law enforcement experience. His staff is urging him to take more time. Lieberman's background is in politics, not law enforcement, which is unusual for the FBI. There are concerns about his age, potential conflicts of interest, and whether he's the best fit for the role. Other candidates include McCabe, McFeely, and others. The article also touches on political implications, like how Lieberman's nomination might affect Senate confirmation and public perception.

Now, considering the moral framing, the article presents the decision as a critical one for the FBI's independence and reputation. Choosing Lieberman could be seen as a political move, undermining the FBI's apolitical nature. There's also the issue of whether Trump is rushing the decision, possibly for political gain, which raises ethical concerns about the integrity of the process.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Trump's decision process, the concerns about Lieberman, and the broader implications for the FBI's independence. I should also mention other candidates and the political dynamics involved.

I should ensure the summary captures the moral aspects, such as the potential conflict of interest, the importance of the FBI's independence, and the criticism of the rushed selection process. It's important to present both the positives and the criticisms to maintain a balanced moral framing.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Trump's decision process, mention Lieberman as a finalist, note the concerns from staff, discuss Lieberman's background and the implications, then touch on other candidates and the political considerations. Conclude with the uncertainty and the stakes involved.

I need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details. Avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to appoint a new FBI director, with former Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman emerging as a finalist. Despite Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump reportedly has a strong rapport with him. However, administration officials and staff have urged caution, citing concerns about Lieberman's age (75) and potential conflicts of interest, given his ties to Trump's lawyer. Lieberman, a political operator with no law enforcement background, would be an unconventional choice for the FBI, which traditionally selects judges or former prosecutors. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI official Richard McFeely, and others. Critics argue that hiring from within could help restore morale after Comey's firing. Trump's decision is seen as politically motivated, with some suggesting Lieberman's bipartisan reputation could boost Trump's credibility. The selection process remains fluid, with no clear choice as Trump prepares for an international trip. END OF SUMMARY.
