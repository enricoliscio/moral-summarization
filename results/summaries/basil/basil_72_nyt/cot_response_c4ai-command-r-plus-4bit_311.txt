SUMMARY: President Trump is very close to choosing a successor to James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, named as a finalist. However, members of Trump's staff are alarmed by his rapid embrace of Lieberman, who has no federal law enforcement experience. They urged him to take more time with such a critical hire. Trump, speaking to reporters, emphasized the need for a great F.B.I. director to restore the agency's special reputation, which was damaged during the campaign. The president acknowledged that Lieberman was a finalist, but it is unclear if this was intended to stoke speculation. Trump is still seeking applicants, and aides have suggested hiring from within the agency to repair morale following Comey's sudden firing. Several candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, are under consideration, with Lieberman reportedly the front-runner. Trump and Lieberman had good chemistry in their private meeting, and Lieberman is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. However, Democrats have pushed back, casting Lieberman as a Democrat in name only. The White House remains divided, with some officials expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest. The selection process is fluid, and Trump may opt for a lesser-known candidate or choose Lieberman for a short stint to lend his bipartisan reputation. Other contenders include former Governor Frank Keating and former Representative Mike Rogers, both Republicans with law enforcement experience.
