SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence and typically prefer judges or former prosecutors as directors. Trump's decision-making process is being kept secret to avoid leaks, but he has publicly acknowledged Lieberman as a finalist. Some aides and law enforcement officials suggest hiring from within the agency to repair morale damaged by Comey's firing. Others, like Senator John McCain, support Lieberman's bipartisan reputation. However, concerns about Lieberman's age, potential conflict of interest, and short-term service are being raised. Trump's choice will be crucial in restoring credibility to the FBI and the presidency.

END OF SUMMARY.
