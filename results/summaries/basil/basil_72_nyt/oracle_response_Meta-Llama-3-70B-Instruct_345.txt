SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump has "embraced" Lieberman, despite concerns about his age and potential conflicts of interest. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence, and Lieberman's political background may not be a good fit. Trump's decision-making process has been marred by "leaks" and a desire to "lend" credibility to his administration. The firing of James Comey has caused "damage" to morale, and Trump's comments about the FBI's reputation have been criticized. Other candidates, including current FBI officials, are still in the running. The choice of director will be critical in repairing the agency's reputation and addressing concerns about "crime" and accountability.

END OF SUMMARY.
