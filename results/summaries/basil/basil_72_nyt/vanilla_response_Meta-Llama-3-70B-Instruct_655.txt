SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph Lieberman as a top contender. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Lieberman, 75, would be an unconventional choice, but Trump has expressed admiration for him. Other candidates include Adam Lee, Richard McFeely, and Andrew McCabe, all current or former FBI officials. Trump is seeking a candidate who can repair the agency's morale after James Comey's firing. Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest due to his employment by a firm with ties to Trump's lawyer have raised concerns. Despite this, Trump has praised Lieberman's bipartisan reputation, which could lend credibility to the president.

END OF SUMMARY.
