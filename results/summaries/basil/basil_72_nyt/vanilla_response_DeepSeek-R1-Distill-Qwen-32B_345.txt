Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump's process of selecting a new FBI director after James Comey's firing. He's close to choosing Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, but his staff is urging him to take more time. Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience, which is a concern. The president might leave for a trip without making a decision yet. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe and others. There's some opposition from Democrats and concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest. The summary should capture these points concisely, within 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning Trump's proximity to a decision, Lieberman as the front-runner, staff concerns, other candidates, opposition, and the fluid nature of the selection process.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to choose a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a leading candidate. Despite Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump reportedly has a strong rapport with him. However, Trump's staff has urged him to take more time due to concerns about Lieberman's qualifications and age (75). Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI agent Mike Rogers, and others. Democrats oppose Lieberman, questioning his independence and ties to Trump's administration. Some worry about potential conflicts of interest, given Lieberman's connections to Trump's lawyer. Trump may leave for a foreign trip without making a decision, and the selection process remains fluid. END OF SUMMARY.
