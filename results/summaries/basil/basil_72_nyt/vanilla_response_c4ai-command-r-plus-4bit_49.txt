SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed 24-hour deadline to choose a new FBI director following the firing of James Comey. Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, has been named as a finalist, but some members of Trump's staff are urging him to take more time with the decision. Trump stated that he cherishes the FBI and wants to restore its reputation. Lieberman's nomination is controversial due to his lack of federal law enforcement experience and his political background. There are concerns about his age and potential conflicts of interest. Other contenders for the position include Adam Lee, Richard McFeely, and Andrew McCabe from within the FBI, as well as former Governor Frank Keating and former Representative Mike Rogers. The White House is divided on the choice, with some expressing doubts about Lieberman. Trump's decision is highly anticipated and will have significant implications for the FBI's reputation and independence.
END OF SUMMARY.
