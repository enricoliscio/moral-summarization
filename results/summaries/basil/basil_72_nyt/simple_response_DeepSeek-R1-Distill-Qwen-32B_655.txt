Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the original author's perspective on the situation.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump considering Joseph Lieberman as the new FBI director, despite concerns from his staff. The article mentions Lieberman's lack of law enforcement experience, his age, and potential conflicts of interest. There's also tension between Democrats and Republicans regarding his nomination.

I should highlight the key moral issues here. The main ones are the suitability of Lieberman for the role, given his background, and the potential for conflict of interest. Also, the political implications of the choice, with Democrats opposing and Republicans supporting, add a layer of moral judgment about the decision-making process.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures these points. I'll structure it to mention Trump's consideration of Lieberman, the staff's concerns, Lieberman's background, the political divide, and the potential conflicts. Ending with the implication that the choice reflects Trump's style ties it all together morally.

Let me draft that, keeping it clear and within the word limit. I'll ensure the moral framing is evident, showing the criticism and concerns surrounding the nomination.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump is considering former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist for FBI director, despite concerns from his staff about Lieberman's lack of law enforcement experience and his ties to Trump's lawyer. Lieberman, a 75-year-old political figure, would be an unconventional choice for the FBI, which has historically been led by judges or former prosecutors. Trump has hinted at Lieberman's candidacy, but some aides and law enforcement officials argue for hiring from within the agency to restore morale after James Comey's firing. Other finalists include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, Richard McFeely, and Adam Lee. Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest, such as his employment with a firm linked to Trump's lawyer, have raised doubts among administration officials. While Democrats criticize Lieberman as a political appointee, Republicans, including Senator John McCain, support him. Trump's decision remains fluid, with some suggesting Lieberman might serve a short term to bolster Trump's credibility. END OF SUMMARY.
