Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump choosing a new FBI director. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that Trump is close to picking a successor for James Comey and has named Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. Lieberman is a former Democratic senator, which is notable because he's a political figure without law enforcement experience. That's a point to include.

Next, there's some opposition from Trump's staff who are concerned about Lieberman's background and age. They're urging Trump to take more time. Also, Trump might leave without making a decision before his trip, which is another important detail.

Lieberman's potential nomination is unusual because FBI directors are typically judges or former prosecutors, not politicians. The article also mentions other candidates like Andrew McCabe, a current acting director, and others. It's worth noting that Trump is considering internal candidates as well.

Additionally, there are concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest. The political implications, like how Democrats and Republicans react, are also relevant. McCain's support is a point to highlight.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes all these elements without going into too much detail. I should structure it to cover Trump's consideration of Lieberman, the staff's concerns, other candidates, and the political reactions.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to select a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman emerging as a leading finalist. Despite Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump has reportedly embraced him, though his staff has urged caution. Lieberman, a political operator with a history of bipartisan appeal, would be an unconventional choice, as FBI directors are typically judges or former prosecutors. Other candidates under consideration include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, former agent Richard McFeely, and special agent Adam Lee. Trump's potential selection of Lieberman has sparked concerns about his age (75) and possible conflicts of interest, as he is employed by a firm linked to Trump's lawyer. The president's decision could also face political backlash, with Democrats criticizing Lieberman's conservative record and Republicans like Senator John McCain expressing support. Trump's team is keeping the process tightly controlled to avoid leaks, but the president may leave for a foreign trip without making a final choice. END OF SUMMARY.
