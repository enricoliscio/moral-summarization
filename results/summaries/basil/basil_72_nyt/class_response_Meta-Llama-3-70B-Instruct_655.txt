SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence, and judges and former prosecutors are typically chosen for the role. Trump's rapid embrace of Lieberman has raised concerns, particularly given the "damage" to morale caused by James Comey's sudden "firing". Trump's team is keeping the decision-making process close to avoid leaks, but the president has hinted that he wants to "repair" the FBI's reputation, which he believes was tarnished during the campaign. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, are still in the running, but Trump's chemistry with Lieberman and the senator's bipartisan reputation may give him an edge.

END OF SUMMARY.
