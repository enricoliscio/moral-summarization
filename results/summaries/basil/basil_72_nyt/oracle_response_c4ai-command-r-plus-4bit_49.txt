SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to choosing a successor to James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, and has named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist. However, members of Trump's staff have urged him to take more time with this critical hire, as Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience and his appointment could damage the F.B.I.'s reputation for independence. Trump, however, cherishes the F.B.I. and believes that its reputation has already been damaged by Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and his own sudden firing. The White House is divided on the choice of Lieberman, with some expressing doubts due to his age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump may be using Lieberman's name to stoke speculation, as he has done with other high-profile picks. Other candidates for the position include current and former F.B.I. agents and officials, as well as a former governor and a former representative. The choice of F.B.I. director is a critical one, and Trump is keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid leaks and outside influence.
END OF SUMMARY.
