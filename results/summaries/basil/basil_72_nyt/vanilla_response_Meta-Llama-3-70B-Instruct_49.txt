SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time to make the critical hire, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Lieberman, 75, would be an atypical choice to lead the FBI, which values its independence. Trump has also interviewed other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, who are all current or former FBI officials. Despite Lieberman being the front-runner, Democrats are pushing back, citing his conservative views and support for Trump's national security adviser pick. Trump's staff is divided on Lieberman, with some expressing concerns about his age and potential conflict of interest. The president's decision is expected to be made soon, but it's unclear if he will make the announcement before leaving for a nine-day foreign trip.

END OF SUMMARY.
