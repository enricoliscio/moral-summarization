SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. Despite Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump has "great" chemistry with him and believes he would bring a "special" reputation to the bureau. However, some administration officials and law enforcement officials have "serious doubts" about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest. Trump's staff is urging him to take more time to make a decision, but he is considering other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, who are all "well-regarded" and have law enforcement experience. Democrats are pushing back against Lieberman, casting him as a "conservative" who would not be a good fit for the role. END OF SUMMARY.
