Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump choosing a new FBI director. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Trump being close to picking Joseph Lieberman as the new FBI director, despite his lack of law enforcement experience. His staff is worried about this choice. Lieberman is a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, which is unusual for an FBI director. The article mentions that Trump might be using this to create speculation, like in "The Apprentice." There are concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest. Other candidates include内部 FBI agents and others with law enforcement backgrounds.

I need to highlight the moral issues here. The main moral points are the potential conflict of interest, the concern over Lieberman's qualifications, the political implications of the choice, and the impact on the FBI's independence. I should make sure these points are clear in the summary.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include Trump's consideration of Lieberman, the concerns from his staff and others, the possible reasons behind the choice, and the implications for the FBI. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral aspects as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline for selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, emerging as a top finalist. Despite Lieberman’s lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump has reportedly embraced him, though his staff has urged caution. Lieberman’s nomination would be unconventional, as FBI directors are typically judges or former prosecutors, not political figures. The administration has described the search as fluid, with Trump and his team keeping the process tightly controlled to avoid leaks. Lieberman, 75, has been praised for his bipartisan appeal but faces concerns over his age and potential conflicts of interest, as he is employed by a firm linked to Trump’s lawyer. Other candidates include FBI agents and former officials, with some advocating for an internal candidate to restore morale after Comey’s firing. Trump’s decision could reflect a strategic move to leverage Lieberman’s reputation for bipartisan support, though Democrats have criticized him as a weak choice. The selection process highlights tensions between political considerations and the FBI’s need for independence. END OF SUMMARY.
