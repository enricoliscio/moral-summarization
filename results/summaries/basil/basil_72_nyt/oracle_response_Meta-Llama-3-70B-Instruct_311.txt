SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, concerned about Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump has "embraced" Lieberman, despite his age and potential conflict of interest, and has even suggested he might serve a short stint to "lend" his bipartisan reputation to the president. The FBI agents prize the bureau's independence, and many law enforcement officials believe hiring from within the agency could repair the "damage" to morale caused by James Comey's sudden "firing". Trump's search process has been marked by "leaks" and speculation, with some aides and officials expressing doubts about Lieberman's candidacy. The president's decision will have significant implications, given the FBI's role in investigating "crime" and the ongoing controversy surrounding the Trump campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
