SUMMARY: President Trump is facing a self-imposed deadline to choose a new F.B.I. director, and has named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist for the role. However, members of his staff have urged him to take more time with this critical hire, as Mr. Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience. There are concerns about Mr. Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest, but he is said to have good chemistry with the president and is friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Other contenders for the role include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. The White House is divided on the choice, with some expressing doubts about Mr. Lieberman. The president's acknowledgment of Mr. Lieberman as a finalist may be intended to stoke speculation, as he has done with other high-profile picks. Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants and is considering candidates from within the F.B.I. to repair the damage to morale caused by the sudden firing of James B. Comey. The F.B.I. has faced challenges to its reputation for independence due to its involvement in the Clinton and Trump campaigns. The choice of a new director is a critical decision, as F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms and are expected to lead the agency apolitically.
END OF SUMMARY.
