SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump has emphasized the need for a "great" director to restore the FBI's "special" reputation, which was damaged during the Clinton campaign and the Trump campaign. Lieberman's bipartisan reputation could lend credibility to Trump's administration. However, Democrats are pushing back, casting Lieberman as a conservative Democrat in name only. Trump's staff is divided, with some expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest. Other candidates, including current FBI officials, are still being considered. END OF SUMMARY.
