SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to choosing a successor to James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, named as a finalist. However, members of Trump's staff have urged him to take more time with this critical hire, concerned about Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump, who cherishes the F.B.I. as an apolitical institution, emphasized the need for a great director to restore its reputation damaged by the Clinton campaign controversy and Comey's firing. Lieberman, 75, would be an atypical choice and has faced opposition from Democrats who view him as a conservative. The White House is divided on the choice, with some citing Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest as concerns. Other contenders include former law enforcement officials and judges with F.B.I. experience, but Trump's emphasis on personal chemistry and the potential for overwhelming Senate support could lend weight to Lieberman's nomination. The president may opt for a short-term appointment to boost his credibility, or he could surprise everyone with an Apprentice-style frenzy, picking a lesser-known candidate.
END OF SUMMARY.
