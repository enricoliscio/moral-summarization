SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence, and judges and former prosecutors are typically chosen for the role. Trump's rapid consideration of Lieberman has raised concerns, and some aides suggest hiring from within the agency to repair morale damaged by Comey's firing. Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all with law enforcement experience. Democrats are pushing back against Lieberman, citing his conservative views and lack of Democratic credentials. The White House remains divided, with some officials expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest.
