Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President Trump choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. The user mentioned that the author used words like "repair," "damage," and "firing," so I need to include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is close to picking Lieberman, but his staff is concerned. The FBI is seen as independent, so Lieberman's political background is unusual. There's also the issue of morale from Comey's firing. Other candidates are being considered, but Lieberman is the front-runner despite concerns about his age and potential conflicts.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump is nearing his deadline and Lieberman is a finalist. Mention the staff's concerns about his experience. Highlight the moral framing words: repairing damage from Comey's firing. Include the unusual choice for FBI, the internal division, and other candidates. Also, note the potential conflicts and Lieberman's possible short term. Keep it all within the word limit.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Trump's situation, mention Lieberman, the concerns, the impact on FBI's reputation, the candidates, and the potential issues. Make sure to include "repair," "damage," and "firing" as per the user's request.

I think that covers all the necessary points while keeping the moral aspects intact. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to select a new F.B.I. director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a finalist. However, his staff has urged caution, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and concerns about his age (75) for a 10-year term. Lieberman, a political operator, would be an unusual choice for the FBI, which values independence. Trump has emphasized the FBI's importance, acknowledging its tarnished reputation due to the Comey firing and the 2016 campaign. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe and former agents, but Lieberman's bipartisan appeal and rapport with Trump make him the front-runner. Critics worry about potential conflicts of interest, as Lieberman is linked to a firm employing Trump's lawyer. The administration remains divided, with some questioning whether Lieberman would serve a short term to repair the FBI's damaged credibility. END OF SUMMARY.
