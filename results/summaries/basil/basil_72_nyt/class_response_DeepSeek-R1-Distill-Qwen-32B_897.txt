Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words: repair, damage, firing. The article is about President Trump selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. I should highlight the moral aspects like the damage caused by Comey's firing and the need to repair morale. I'll also mention the concerns about Lieberman's qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include those key moral terms.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his deadline to select a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a finalist. However, Trump's staff has urged him to take more time, concerned about Lieberman's lack of law enforcement experience and his age, which could raise questions about a 10-year term. The search has been fluid, with other candidates like Andrew McCabe, a veteran agent, and Richard McFeely, a former senior official, also under consideration. Trump emphasized the importance of the FBI's reputation, which he believes was damaged by events related to the Clinton and Trump campaigns. The firing of James Comey has left morale in need of repair, and some suggest hiring from within the agency. Lieberman's potential nomination has sparked political divides, with Democrats criticizing his conservative stance and Republicans, like John McCain, expressing support. The decision remains uncertain, with concerns about conflict of interest and Lieberman's suitability for the role. END OF SUMMARY.
