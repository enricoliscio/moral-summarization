SUMMARY: President Trump, nearing his self-imposed deadline for selecting a new F.B.I. director, named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist for the position. However, some members of his staff urged him to slow down the process and consider other candidates, given Mr. Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The F.B.I. is known for its independence, and Mr. Lieberman's political background could be seen as a potential conflict of interest. There were also concerns about his age, as F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Lieberman and emphasized the need for a qualified candidate to restore the F.B.I.'s reputation after the controversies surrounding James B. Comey's tenure and dismissal. Other contenders for the position included Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom had law enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Trump faced pressure from his advisers and law enforcement officials to choose a candidate from within the agency to boost morale. The selection process was kept tightly under wraps due to the administration's concerns about leaks. Despite the ethical dilemmas, Mr. Lieberman's bipartisan reputation and relationship with Trump seemed to put him in the lead. 

END OF SUMMARY.
