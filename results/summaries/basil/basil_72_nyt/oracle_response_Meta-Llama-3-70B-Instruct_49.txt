SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump's rapid "embrace" of Lieberman has raised concerns, and the president's team is keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid "leaks". Trump has "cherished" the FBI, but the agency's reputation has been damaged by the "firing" of James Comey and the controversy surrounding the Clinton campaign. Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest have also raised doubts. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee and Andrew G. McCabe, are still in the running. Trump's selection process has been marked by an "Apprentice"-style frenzy of speculation, and it remains unclear whether he will choose a candidate with law enforcement experience or a political operator like Lieberman. The president's decision will have significant implications for the FBI's morale and reputation.

END OF SUMMARY.
