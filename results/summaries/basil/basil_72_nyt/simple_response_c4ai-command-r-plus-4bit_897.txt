SUMMARY: President Trump is facing a moral dilemma in his choice of a new F.B.I. director, a decision that has far-reaching implications for the integrity and independence of the bureau. On the one hand, he is considering Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee with no federal law enforcement experience but a charming political operator. On the other hand, he is also seeking applicants from within the F.B.I., including well-regarded agents and former senior officials, to repair the damage to morale caused by James Comey's firing. The dilemma is further complicated by the fact that Mr. Lieberman, at 75 years old and with potential conflicts of interest, may not be a suitable long-term choice for the 10-year term. Additionally, his conservative leanings and support for Trump's controversial decisions have caused Democrats to push back. The White House is divided, with some advisers suggesting that a short stint by Mr. Lieberman could lend his bipartisan reputation to Trump's presidency. The decision is a critical test for Trump, and the world is watching to see if he will prioritize the F.B.I.'s independence and integrity in his choice of a new director.
