SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, concerned about Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence and are wary of a political operator leading the agency. Trump's rapid embrace of Lieberman has raised doubts, with some aides suggesting he hire from within the agency to repair the damage to morale caused by James Comey's sudden firing. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, are still being considered. Trump's decision-making process is being kept closely held to avoid leaks. The president's choice will be critical in restoring the FBI's reputation, which has been damaged by the events surrounding the Clinton campaign and Trump's own campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
