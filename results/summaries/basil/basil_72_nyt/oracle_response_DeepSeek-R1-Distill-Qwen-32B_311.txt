SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to choose a new F.B.I. director, with former Democratic Senator Joseph I. Lieberman emerging as a finalist. However, his staff has urged him to take more time, concerned about Lieberman’s lack of federal law enforcement experience and potential conflicts of interest. The search remains fluid, with other candidates like Acting Director Andrew McCabe and former agents also under consideration. Trump has emphasized his desire for a "great" director, "cherishing" the F.B.I. and acknowledging its diminished reputation due to recent controversies. While Lieberman’s political background and age (75) raise concerns, his bipartisan appeal and friendship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions make him a strong contender. Critics argue hiring from within could repair morale damaged by Comey’s "firing." The decision could also have political implications, as Lieberman’s selection might "lend" credibility to Trump but faces skepticism from Democrats. END OF SUMMARY.
