SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, emerging as a finalist. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence and typically choose judges or former prosecutors, not elected officials. Despite this, Trump has praised Lieberman, saying he would bring a "special" reputation to the FBI. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, are still being considered. Democrats are pushing back against Lieberman, citing his conservative views and lack of support from party members. The White House is divided, with some officials expressing concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest.

END OF SUMMARY.
