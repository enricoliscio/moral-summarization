SUMMARY: President Trump told reporters he was "very close" to choosing a new F.B.I. director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, named as a finalist. However, some members of Trump's staff urged him to take more time with the decision. Trump emphasized the need for a great F.B.I. director, acknowledging the bureau's reputation had been damaged by recent events. Lieberman's selection was questioned by some Democrats, who viewed him as a conservative and a Democrat in name only. Nonetheless, Lieberman had the support of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Senator John McCain. Concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest were also raised. Other contenders for the position included former law enforcement officials and judges, with some aides suggesting an internal hire to boost morale. The decision-making process was kept closely guarded, and Trump's final choice remained uncertain.
END OF SUMMARY.
