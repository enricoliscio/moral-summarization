SUMMARY: President Trump is facing pressure from his staff to slow down the process of selecting a new F.B.I. director, just 24 hours before his self-imposed deadline. While Trump has named Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist for the role, some members of his staff are urging him to take more time to make such a critical hire. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, has no federal law enforcement experience, which has raised concerns among some in the White House. 

Trump, however, seems inclined towards choosing Lieberman, citing good chemistry between them and the potential for bipartisan support in the Senate. Nevertheless, Democrats have pushed back, characterizing Lieberman as a conservative and a Democrat in name only. There are also concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest due to his employment at a firm connected to Trump's lawyer. 

The White House is divided on the matter, with some officials expressing serious doubts about Lieberman. As a result, Trump may opt for a lesser-known candidate or choose someone from within the F.B.I. to repair the damage caused by James Comey's firing. Other finalists include former Gov. Frank Keating, former Rep. Mike Rogers, and judges Michael J. Garcia and Henry E. Hudson. The decision-making process is being closely guarded to avoid leaks.
END OF SUMMARY.
