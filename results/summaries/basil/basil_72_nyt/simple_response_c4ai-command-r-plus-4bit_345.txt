SUMMARY: President Trump is facing pressure from his staff and lawmakers alike as he nears his self-imposed 24-hour deadline to pick a new F.B.I. director. The choice is a critical one, as the F.B.I. is regarded as one of Washington's few apolitical institutions, and Trump is aware that he needs to appoint someone who will restore the agency's reputation after the controversial firing of James Comey.

Trump has named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist for the position. Lieberman, a 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience, has been criticized by some as being too old for the job and as having potential conflicts of interest due to his current employment. However, others argue that his bipartisan reputation and charm could be an asset to a president in need of credibility.

Administration officials have described the search as fluid, and other contenders for the position include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. The White House is divided on the best choice, and there are concerns that Trump may leave for a nine-day foreign trip without making a decision. The F.B.I. director serves a 10-year term, and the appointment is a crucial one for the integrity and morale of the agency.
END OF SUMMARY.
