Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. His staff is concerned about Lieberman's qualifications and political background. There's also mention of other candidates like McCabe, and the internal divisions in the White House about this decision.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: embrace, leaks, cherish, damage, firing, crime, ouster, watergate, lend. I should incorporate these into the summary without making it too long—under 200 words.

I'll start by stating Trump is close to choosing, using "embrace" to describe his quick acceptance of Lieberman. Then mention the staff's concerns about leaks and the fluid nature of the search. Highlight Trump's emphasis on cherishing the FBI's reputation, which was damaged by Comey's firing. Include the comparison to Watergate and the potential conflict of interest with Lieberman's age and job. Mention other candidates and the internal divisions.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key points: Trump's quick embrace, staff's concerns, Lieberman's background, the damage to the FBI's reputation, the comparison to Watergate, and the potential issues with Lieberman's candidacy. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included naturally in the context. I'll avoid adding any extra information not in the article and keep the summary within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. His staff has urged him to take more time, alarmed by his rapid embrace of Lieberman, who lacks federal law enforcement experience. The search remains fluid, with Trump keeping the process closely held to avoid leaks. Trump emphasized his cherish for the FBI’s reputation, which has been damaged by Comey’s firing and the political fallout from the 2016 campaign. Lieberman’s candidacy has sparked concerns about his age, 75, and potential conflicts of interest, given his ties to a firm where Trump’s lawyer works. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe and former F.B.I. agent Mike Rogers. Trump’s decision could be influenced by Lieberman’s bipartisan appeal, but some aides doubt his suitability. The White House remains divided, with concerns about the FBI’s independence and the potential for a short-term appointment to lend credibility to Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
