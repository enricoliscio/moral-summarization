SUMMARY: President Trump is facing pressure to carefully consider his choice for the new F.B.I. director, a critical hire to repair the damage caused by the sudden firing of James B. Comey. While Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, is a finalist for the position, some members of Trump's staff have urged him to take more time with the decision. Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his age have raised concerns among administration officials and Democrats. However, Trump values his good chemistry with Lieberman and his friendship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Other contenders for the role include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. There is a possibility that Lieberman could be chosen for a short stint to boost Trump's credibility, but the decision-making process is being closely guarded to avoid leaks.
END OF SUMMARY.
