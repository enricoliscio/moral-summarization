SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top contender. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time to make this critical hire, citing concerns about Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence and are wary of Lieberman's political background. Trump's rapid embrace of Lieberman has raised eyebrows, and some aides suggest hiring from within the agency to repair the damage to morale caused by James Comey's sudden firing. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, are still in the running. Trump's decision-making process has been criticized for being opaque, and some officials have expressed doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest. The president's choice will have significant implications for the FBI's reputation and credibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
