SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline for choosing a new F.B.I. director, with former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a conservative Democrat, emerging as a leading candidate. Lieberman's political experience and relationship with Trump are seen as advantages, but some White House staff are urging Trump to take more time with the decision and consider other candidates. There is also concern about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest due to his law firm connections. Other candidates under consideration include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement backgrounds. Trump values personal chemistry in his hires, and it is unclear if he will opt for an insider or an outsider to lead the F.B.I. The decision is further complicated by the ongoing Russia investigation and Trump's desire to repair the F.B.I.'s morale. 

END OF SUMMARY.
