SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time to make this critical hire, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence, and judges and former prosecutors are often chosen for the role. Trump's rapid embrace of Lieberman has raised concerns, particularly given the "damage to morale" caused by James Comey's sudden firing. Trump is seeking applicants, and some aides suggest hiring from within the agency to "repair" the damage. Other candidates, including Adam S. Lee and Andrew G. McCabe, are still under consideration. Trump's decision-making process is closely held, but his acknowledgment of Lieberman as a finalist has sparked speculation. The choice of FBI director is critical, and Trump's decision will be closely watched.

END OF SUMMARY.
