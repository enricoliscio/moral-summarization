SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump has emphasized the need for a "great" director to restore the FBI's "special" reputation, which was damaged during the campaign. Lieberman's bipartisan reputation could lend credibility to Trump, but some officials have raised concerns about his age and potential conflict of interest. Other candidates, including judges and former prosecutors, are still being considered. Trump's decision-making process has been kept closely held to avoid leaks. END OF SUMMARY.
