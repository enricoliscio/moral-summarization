Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: repair, damage, firing. I should make sure to incorporate these words where appropriate.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump's process of selecting a new FBI director after James Comey was fired. The key points are that Trump is considering Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, despite concerns from his staff. There are also other candidates being interviewed, and the process is secretive to avoid leaks. Trump's firing of Comey is seen as damaging morale, and there's a push to repair that by possibly hiring from within the FBI.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary, under 200 words, using the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Trump being close to choosing a successor, naming Lieberman as a finalist. Then, note the staff's concerns and the potential for not selecting before the trip. Highlight the unusual choice of Lieberman, given his lack of law enforcement experience. Mention the reasons for the secretive process and the candidates interviewed. Emphasize the damage caused by Comey's firing and the need to repair morale. Also, include the age concern and possible short-term appointment. Conclude with the political implications and the divided White House opinion.

I'll make sure to weave in "repair," "damage," and "firing" naturally into the summary. Keep the language clear and concise, sticking to the key points without getting too detailed. I should also ensure the summary flows logically, starting from Trump's consideration, moving to the concerns, the candidates, and the implications.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to choose a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a finalist. However, his staff has urged him to take more time due to Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The search remains fluid, with other candidates like Acting Director Andrew G. McCabe and former agents under consideration. Trump emphasized the importance of the FBI’s reputation, acknowledging the damage caused by James Comey’s firing and the need to repair morale. Some aides suggest hiring from within the agency, but Lieberman’s bipartisan appeal and chemistry with Trump make him a strong contender. Concerns about his age and potential conflicts of interest persist, with speculation he might serve a short term. The White House remains divided, with some officials expressing doubts about Lieberman’s suitability. END OF SUMMARY.
