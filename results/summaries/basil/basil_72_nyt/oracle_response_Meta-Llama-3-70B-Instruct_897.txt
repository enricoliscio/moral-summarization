SUMMARY:

President Trump is "very close" to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, alarmed by his rapid "embrace" of Lieberman, who lacks federal law enforcement experience. The search is fluid, with Trump keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid "leaks". Trump "cherishes" the FBI, but its agents prize the bureau's independence. Lieberman's age, 75, could be problematic, and his employment by a firm with ties to Trump's lawyer raises conflict-of-interest concerns. Trump's staff is divided, with some suggesting he hire from within the agency to repair "damage" to morale wrought by Comey's "firing". Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all with law enforcement experience. Trump's pick could be seen as an attempt to "lend" credibility to his administration, still reeling from the "ouster" of Comey and comparisons to "Watergate".

END OF SUMMARY.
