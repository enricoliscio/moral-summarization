Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's selection of a new FBI director. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. So first, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Trump being close to choosing a successor for James Comey, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience, which is causing concerns among Trump's staff. They're urging him to take more time, but he might leave without making a decision before his trip.

I should note that Lieberman is a political figure, not a law enforcement expert, which raises questions about his suitability. The article mentions that some aides and law enforcement officials prefer an internal candidate, like Andrew McCabe, to improve morale after Comey's firing.

There's also political tension: Democrats oppose Lieberman, seeing him as a weak Democrat, while Republicans like McCain support him. The White House is divided, with concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest.

I need to capture the moral aspects, like the independence of the FBI and the political implications of the choice. The summary should reflect the debate over whether a political figure or an internal candidate is better for the FBI's reputation.

Now, I'll condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral framing without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the main issues: the finalists, concerns about Lieberman, internal vs. external candidates, political implications, and the White House's internal divisions.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward, ensuring the moral aspects are evident. Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and covers all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to appoint a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, emerging as a leading finalist. Despite Lieberman’s political background and lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump reportedly has a strong rapport with him. However, administration officials and law enforcement leaders have urged caution, advocating for an internal candidate like Acting Director Andrew McCabe to restore agency morale after James Comey’s abrupt firing. Lieberman’s selection could face opposition from Democrats, who view him as a weak figure, while Republicans like Senator John McCain support him. The White House remains divided, with concerns about Lieberman’s age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump’s decision could influence the FBI’s independence and credibility, with some suggesting Lieberman might serve a short term to bolster Trump’s image. END OF SUMMARY.
