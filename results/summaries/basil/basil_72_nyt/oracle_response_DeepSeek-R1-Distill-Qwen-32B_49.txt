Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: embrace, leaks, cherish, damage, firing, crime, ouster, watergate, lend. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. His staff is concerned about Lieberman's lack of law enforcement experience and his age. There's talk about leaks and the fluidity of the search process. Trump emphasizes cherishing the FBI and mentions its reputation being damaged. He's considering other candidates like McCabe, and there's political pushback from Democrats. There's also the mention of Watergate as a comparison and the idea that Lieberman might lend credibility.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump is close to choosing, mention Lieberman as a finalist, note staff concerns about his qualifications, and the fluid process. Include the leaks, cherish the FBI, reputation damage from Comey's firing. Mention other candidates and the political pushback. Highlight the Watergate comparison and the potential for Lieberman to lend credibility despite doubts.

I should structure it to flow logically, making sure to incorporate the moral words where they fit naturally. I'll avoid adding new information beyond what's in the article. Also, keep the tone consistent with the original article's framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each sentence includes the moral terms where appropriate and that the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. Despite staff concerns about Lieberman's qualifications and age, Trump has embraced him as a potential candidate. The search process remains fluid, with leaks being a concern. Trump emphasized his cherishing of the FBI, noting its damaged reputation due to Comey's firing. Other candidates, including Acting Director Andrew McCabe, are under consideration. Democrats oppose Lieberman, viewing him as a weak choice, while Republicans, including John McCain, support him. Lieberman's ties to Trump's lawyer raise conflict-of-interest fears. Trump's aides suggest Lieberman might serve a short term to lend credibility, though doubts persist about his suitability. The decision could impact the FBI's independence and reputation. END OF SUMMARY.
