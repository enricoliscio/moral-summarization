SUMMARY: President Trump is facing a moral dilemma 24 hours before his self-imposed deadline to pick a new F.B.I. director. The decision is critical as it comes on the heels of the sudden firing of James B. Comey, which has damaged the morale of the agency. Trump is considering Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist for the role. However, members of Trump's staff have urged him to take more time with the decision and consider other candidates, given Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his advanced age. There are concerns that Lieberman may not be able to serve the full 10-year term typical for F.B.I. directors. 

Trump has also interviewed several other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. McCabe, the acting director, is a veteran agent who once specialized in Russian organized crime. The White House is divided on the choice, with some advisers suggesting that Trump hire from within the agency to repair the damage caused by Comey's firing. The decision-making process is being kept closely guarded to avoid leaks. 

Trump, however, has publicly expressed his enthusiasm for Lieberman, stating that the F.B.I. needs a great director to restore its reputation after the controversies of the recent campaigns. It remains to be seen whether Trump will opt for Lieberman or another candidate, and whether the eventual pick will serve a full term or a shorter stint.
END OF SUMMARY.
