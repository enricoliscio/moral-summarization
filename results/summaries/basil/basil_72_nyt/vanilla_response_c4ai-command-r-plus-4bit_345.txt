SUMMARY: President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with a self-imposed deadline of 24 hours. Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, is a finalist for the position despite lacking federal law enforcement experience. Administration officials described the search as fluid, and Trump is still seeking applicants. Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all with law enforcement backgrounds, are also under consideration. Lieberman, aged 75, would be an atypical choice due to his age and political background, but he has the support of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Senator John McCain. However, some White House aides and Democrats have expressed doubts about his suitability for the role. Other contenders include former Governor Frank Keating and former Representative Mike Rogers, both Republicans with law enforcement experience. The White House is divided over the choice, and Trump may opt for a lesser-known candidate or someone from within the FBI to boost morale. The president is seeking a director with good chemistry and bipartisan support.
END OF SUMMARY.
