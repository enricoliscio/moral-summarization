SUMMARY: President Trump, nearing his self-imposed deadline for picking an F.B.I. director, named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, members of his staff urged him to take more time, concerned about Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump praised the F.B.I. and emphasized the need for an apolitical director, acknowledging the damage caused by James Comey's actions during the campaign. Lieberman's potential nomination faced opposition from Democrats who viewed him as a conservative and a Trump supporter. The White House was divided, with some expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest due to his connection to a lawyer for Trump. Other contenders included Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all with law enforcement backgrounds. Trump valued chemistry and personal connection in his hiring decisions. The nomination process was kept closely guarded to avoid leaks. 

END OF SUMMARY.
