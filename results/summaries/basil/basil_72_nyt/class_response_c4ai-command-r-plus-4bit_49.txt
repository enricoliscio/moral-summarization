SUMMARY: President Trump is facing pressure to make a judicious selection for the new F.B.I. director, a critical hire to repair the damage caused by the sudden firing of James B. Comey. With a self-imposed deadline of 24 hours, Trump named Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist for the role. However, members of Trump's staff have urged him to take more time with the decision, as Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience, and his appointment could be controversial. Administration officials described the search as fluid, and Trump is still seeking applicants. Several candidates are under consideration, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all of whom have law enforcement experience. The selection of the new F.B.I. director is a highly sensitive matter, as the bureau values its independence as an apolitical institution. Trump, however, seems drawn to Lieberman, with whom he shares good chemistry and who has the support of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. There are concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest, leading to speculation that he may only serve a short stint if selected. Other contenders include former Gov. Frank Keating and former Rep. Mike Rogers, both Republicans with law enforcement backgrounds. The final decision remains closely guarded, with Trump emphasizing the need to restore the F.B.I.'s reputation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
