Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump selecting a new FBI director. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, Trump is close to choosing a successor for James Comey, and Joseph Lieberman is a finalist. Lieberman is a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, which is interesting because he's a political figure without federal law enforcement experience. Trump's staff is concerned about this choice, urging him to take more time. It looks like Trump might leave without picking someone before his trip.

The article mentions that Lieberman is an unusual choice because the FBI prefers judges or former prosecutors, not elected officials. There's also talk about the process being secretive to avoid leaks, which Trump thinks are common in the White House. Trump confirmed Lieberman is a finalist, emphasizing the importance of the FBI's reputation.

There's speculation that Trump might be creating buzz around Lieberman's candidacy, only to choose someone else. Other candidates include Adam Lee, Richard McFeely, and Andrew McCabe, who is the acting director. McCabe has experience with Russian organized crime, which might be relevant given recent events.

Some in Trump's administration doubt Lieberman because of his age (75) and potential conflicts of interest with his employer. If chosen, he might serve a short term to boost Trump's credibility. Other finalists include Frank Keating and Mike Rogers, with Rogers being endorsed by the agents' association.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on Trump's consideration of Lieberman, the concerns from his staff, other candidates, and the implications of each choice. I should highlight the unusual nature of Lieberman's nomination and the internal divisions in the administration.

Let me structure this: start with Trump being close to choosing a successor, mention Lieberman as a finalist, note the concerns about his background, then discuss other candidates and the potential issues with Lieberman's nomination. Conclude with the implications for the FBI's reputation and Trump's credibility.

I should ensure the summary is concise and captures all major points without getting bogged down in details. Also, make sure to mention the possible impact on the FBI's independence and the political dynamics involved.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline to select a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, emerging as a finalist. Despite Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience, Trump reportedly favors him, though his staff has urged caution. Lieberman, 75, is an unconventional choice, as FBI directors are typically judges or former prosecutors. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, former agent Richard McFeely, and Special Agent Adam Lee. Some in Trump's administration doubt Lieberman due to his age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump emphasized the FBI's importance and its tarnished reputation during the 2016 campaign. The selection process remains secretive, with officials divided over Lieberman's suitability. END OF SUMMARY.
