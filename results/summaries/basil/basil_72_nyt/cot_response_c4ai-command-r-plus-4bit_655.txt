SUMMARY: 
President Trump is very close to choosing a successor to James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, with a self-imposed deadline of 24 hours. Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, is a finalist for the position. However, members of Trump's staff are alarmed by his rapid embrace of Lieberman due to his lack of federal law enforcement experience and his age, 75. They have urged Trump to take more time with this critical hire. Trump, speaking with reporters, emphasized the need for a great F.B.I. director to restore the agency's reputation, which has been damaged by Comey's actions during the campaign. Lieberman, with his bipartisan reputation and good chemistry with Trump, could be a short-term choice to lend credibility to the president. However, Democrats are pushing back, casting Lieberman as a conservative in name only. The White House is divided, with senior officials expressing serious doubts about Lieberman due to his age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump is still considering other candidates, including Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe. The selection process remains fluid, with Trump valuing chemistry and the potential for overwhelming Senate support. The final decision is expected soon, but it is unclear if Trump will make the pick before his upcoming foreign trip.
