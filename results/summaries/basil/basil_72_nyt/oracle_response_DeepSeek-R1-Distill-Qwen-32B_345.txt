Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user provided the article and a list of those words. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph Lieberman as a finalist. There's some internal conflict in the administration about this choice, and various moral implications are discussed.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words: embrace, leaks, cherish, damage, firing, crime, ouster, Watergate, lend. I should identify where these words are used in the article and ensure they're included in the summary.

The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: Trump is close to choosing Lieberman, staff is concerned, possible delay, Lieberman's background, internal White House dynamics, and the implications of the choice.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's actions, the staff's concerns, the possibility of a delay, Lieberman's background and potential issues, and the broader implications like Watergate comparisons. I'll make sure to use the moral words appropriately, like "embrace," "damage," "firing," etc.

I should also keep the tone neutral but reflect the moral framing. For example, mentioning the "damage to morale" from Comey's firing, or the potential conflict of interest with Lieberman's employment. I'll need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it includes all the required moral words and that it accurately reflects the article's content and framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to selecting Joseph I. Lieberman as the new FBI director, despite concerns from his staff about Lieberman's lack of law enforcement experience and his 75-year-old age. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, is seen as a politically savvy but unconventional choice for the FBI, an institution known for its independence. Trump has "embraced" Lieberman, but his staff has urged him to take more time, fearing the "damage" to morale caused by Comey's "firing" and the potential for "leaks" in the selection process. Lieberman's ties to a firm where Trump's lawyer works could raise "conflict-of-interest" accusations. Trump has also considered other candidates, including Acting Director Andrew McCabe, but Lieberman remains the front-runner. His selection could "lend" bipartisan credibility to Trump, though some officials doubt his suitability for a 10-year term. The choice has sparked political tensions, with Democrats criticizing Lieberman as a "Democrat in name only" and Republicans like John McCain defending him. The White House remains divided, with some aides expressing reservations about Lieberman's age and experience. Trump's decision could delay until after his foreign trip, with the possibility of a short-term appointment for Lieberman. END OF SUMMARY.
