SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a top finalist. However, Trump's staff is urging him to take more time, citing concerns about Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. The FBI agents value the bureau's independence, and Lieberman's political background may not be a good fit. Trump's rapid "embrace" of Lieberman has raised eyebrows, and some aides are worried about the "damage" to morale caused by James Comey's sudden "firing". Trump's search process has been criticized for being opaque, with concerns about "leaks" and a lack of transparency. Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest have also been raised as issues. Trump has praised the FBI, saying he "cherish[es]" the institution, but his handling of the search process has been met with skepticism. The decision is critical, given the FBI's role in investigating "crime" and the ongoing controversy surrounding Trump's campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
