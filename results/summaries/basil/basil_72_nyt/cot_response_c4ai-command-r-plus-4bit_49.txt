SUMMARY:
President Trump is very close to choosing a successor to the recently fired F.B.I. director James Comey. Joseph Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, is a finalist for the position, despite some concerns about his lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump's staff is alarmed by the president's rapid embrace of Lieberman and has urged him to take more time with this critical hire. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., an agency known for its apolitical nature. Trump values good chemistry and has a key ingredient for hiring people. 

Administration officials describe the search as fluid and are keeping the decision-making process closely guarded to avoid leaks. Lieberman is friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who believes he will receive overwhelming support in the Senate. However, Democrats push back on this notion, casting Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting his support for Trump's controversial national security adviser. 

The White House remains divided, with several officials expressing serious doubts about Lieberman due to his age and potential conflicts of interest. Trump is still seeking applicants and may opt for an internal hire to repair the damage to morale caused by Comey's firing. Several well-regarded F.B.I. officials and former prosecutors are also under consideration. Trump's successful campaign and his desire for a special F.B.I. director with bipartisan support are key factors in this decision.
