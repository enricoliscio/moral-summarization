Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's search for a new FBI director. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing words: repair, damage, and firing. I should keep those words in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is close to choosing a successor for Comey, with Lieberman as a finalist. His staff is worried about Lieberman's lack of law enforcement experience and his age. There's concern about the damage done by Comey's firing and the need to repair morale. Other candidates include McCabe and others within the FBI. The White House is divided, and there are potential conflicts of interest with Lieberman.

I need to structure the summary to include the moral words. I'll start by mentioning Trump is close to choosing, then note the staff's concerns about Lieberman. Highlight the damage from Comey's firing and the need to repair. Mention the other candidates and the internal division. Conclude with the potential conflict and Lieberman's possible short-term role.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include all the key points and the moral framing words. Avoid adding any extra information not in the article.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing his self-imposed deadline for selecting a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a leading finalist. However, his staff has urged him to take more time due to Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his age, 75, raising concerns about a potential 10-year term. The search aims to repair the damage caused by James Comey's sudden firing, which has hurt morale within the agency. Other candidates include Acting Director Andrew McCabe, Richard McFeely, and Adam Lee, all from within the FBI. Trump's decision-making process remains closely guarded to avoid leaks, which he believes are endemic in the West Wing. While Lieberman's bipartisan reputation and good chemistry with Trump make him a strong contender, some aides and law enforcement officials argue for hiring from within to rebuild the FBI's reputation. The White House is divided, with concerns about Lieberman's age and potential conflicts of interest, such as his ties to a firm where Trump's lawyer works. END OF SUMMARY.
