SUMMARY:

All Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation finding no evidence. In a letter, the lawmakers accused Schiff of lying and leaking information, and urged his immediate resignation. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation from Congress. Schiff has maintained that there is evidence of collusion, despite Mueller's findings. During a hearing, Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has defended Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and saying Democrats will continue to pursue oversight and release of the full Mueller report.

END OF SUMMARY.
