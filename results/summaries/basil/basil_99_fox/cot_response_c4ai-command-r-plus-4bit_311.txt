SUMMARY:
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman over his claims of Trump-Russia collusion. In a letter signed by every Republican on the committee, they accused Schiff of driving a "false narrative" and "undermining the faith" of the American people. They claimed that his actions were "incompatible" with his duty as chairman and that they had "no faith" in his ability to discharge his duties. This call for resignation was also echoed by President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham, who criticized Schiff for his "outrageous comments." Schiff, a vocal critic of the President, has stood by his claims and defended himself during a hearing, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the calls for Schiff's resignation as "absolutely ridiculous," arguing that he was being attacked because he was doing a legitimate and outstanding job. She stated that Democrats would not be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of the full Mueller report and legitimate oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
