Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, even though Mueller found nothing. 

I should note the key points: the letter from Republicans, their demand for Schiff's resignation, the Mueller report's conclusion, Trump's tweet, Lindsey Graham's comments, Schiff's defense, Pelosi's support, and the ongoing push for the full Mueller report.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention the demand, then the reasons, followed by reactions from Trump and Graham, Schiff's response, and Pelosi's backing. Finally, I'll wrap it up with the broader context of the Mueller report release.

SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the Mueller investigation finding no evidence. In a letter to Schiff, they accused him of failing to fulfill his duties and urged his resignation. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his removal from Congress and Graham comparing him to Oliver Stone. Schiff defended his stance, pointing to Russian interference in the 2016 election and meetings between Trump associates and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, calling the calls for his removal "absolutely ridiculous." The committee remains focused on securing the full Mueller report. END OF SUMMARY.
