SUMMARY: Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff resign as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which have been refuted by the Mueller probe. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his duties as chairman and have undermined the faith of the American people. President Trump and other top Republicans have also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking information. Schiff has defended himself by pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed the calls for Schiff's resignation, stating that he has done an outstanding job and that Democrats will not be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
