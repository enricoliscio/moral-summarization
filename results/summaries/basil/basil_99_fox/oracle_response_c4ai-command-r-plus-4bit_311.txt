SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, undermining the faith of the American people. This demand comes after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe found no evidence of collusion. President Trump and other Republicans, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, have also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of knowingly lying and leaking information. Schiff, a vocal critic of Trump, has defended his position, citing evidence of Russian hacking, meetings between Trump associates and Russians, and offers of dirt on Hillary Clinton. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed calls for Schiff's resignation, stating that he has done an outstanding job and that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight. 

END OF SUMMARY.
