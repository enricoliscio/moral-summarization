Alright, so I need to help the user with this query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll break down the user's instructions. They mentioned two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and follow specific formatting.

Looking at the provided response, it seems the user has already done the first step, identifying words like "demanded," "evidence," "collusion," etc. They also included a summary that incorporates these words. But perhaps the user is asking for a more detailed thought process or a different approach.

I should consider the structure. The user wants me to first list the morally framed words, each on a new line with an asterisk. Then, write a summary that includes these words. The summary needs to capture the essence of the article while maintaining the moral tone.

I'll start by reading through the article to understand the context. It's about Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation due to his claims about Trump-Russia collusion, despite Mueller's findings. There's a lot of accusation and counter-accusation, with moral implications on both sides.

Identifying the morally charged words is crucial. Words like "demanded," "evidence," "collusion," "slammed," "immediate resignation," "lying," "leaking," "unlawfully," "outrageous," "conspiracy," "undermining," "false narrative," "outright lie," "hostile," "unlawful," "unconstitutional," "intimidated," "distracted," "legitimate," "Constitutional responsibility," "faith," "compromised," "hostile," "Constitution," "duty," "impeachment," "wrongdoing," "exoneration," "truth," "accountability," "transparency," "justice," "fairness," "integrity," "credibility," "trust," "legitimacy," "rule of law," "public trust," "accountability," "transparency," "justice," "fairness," "integrity," "credibility," "trust," "legitimacy," "rule of law," "public trust."

Now, for the summary, I need to weave these words into a concise narrative. The summary should highlight the conflict between Republicans and Schiff, the accusations, and the broader implications of the situation, all while using the identified moral terms.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the demand for Schiff's resignation, moving through the accusations and counter-accusations, and ending with the political implications and the ongoing debate over the Mueller report.

I also need to be careful with the word count, keeping it under 200 words. I'll have to be concise but comprehensive, making sure each key point is addressed without going into too much detail.

Finally, I'll structure the summary with the required tokens: starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it seem forced.

Overall, the goal is to present a clear, morally charged summary that reflects the original article's framing while adhering to the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, accusing him of making false claims about Trump-Russia collusion despite Mueller’s findings. They slammed Schiff for spreading a "false narrative" and undermining public faith, urging his immediate resignation. Schiff defended his claims, citing Russian interference and Trump campaign meetings with Russians. Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, opposed the calls for Schiff’s resignation, calling them "absolutely ridiculous" and emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability. The debate over Schiff’s leadership reflects broader tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the Mueller report and constitutional responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
