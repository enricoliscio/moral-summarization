Alright, so I need to help summarize this news article. The user is asking for a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and they want it to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." They also provided an example of what they expect, so I should follow that structure.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman because of his claims about Trump-Russia collusion. They sent a letter, and they mentioned this during a hearing. Mueller's report didn't find collusion, but Schiff insists there was. Pelosi supports Schiff, and there's some back and forth about the Mueller report's release.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these key points without getting too detailed. I should mention the letter, the hearing, Mueller's findings, Schiff's defense, and Pelosi's support. Also, include the part about the full Mueller report being demanded by Schiff and others.

I'll start by stating the Republicans' demand, then mention the letter and hearing. Then, note Mueller's findings and Schiff's stance. Include Pelosi's response and the ongoing demand for the full report. Keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me check if I'm including all necessary elements: the demand, the reasons, Mueller's report, Schiff's defense, Pelosi's support, and the push for the full report. Yes, that seems comprehensive.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman over his claims of Trump-Russia collusion, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report finding no evidence of such collusion. In a letter and during a hearing, Republicans accused Schiff of undermining the committee's duties and called for his resignation. Schiff defended his stance, citing Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump campaign meetings with Russians. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation. Schiff, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, insists on pursuing the full Mueller report and has not backed down from his claims. Pelosi dismissed calls for Schiff's removal, stating they were "absolutely ridiculous." The controversy highlights ongoing divisions over the Mueller investigation and its implications. END OF SUMMARY.
