SUMMARY:

House Republicans are demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, accusing him of lying about having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. Despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation finding no evidence of collusion, Schiff continues to claim that there is "undoubtedly" collusion. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman and have lost faith in his ability to discharge his duties. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham have also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. Schiff defends himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians, but Republicans argue that he is driving a "false narrative" and undermining the faith of the American people. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are standing by Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and vowing to continue pursuing legitimate oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
