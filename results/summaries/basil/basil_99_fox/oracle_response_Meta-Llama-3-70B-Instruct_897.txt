SUMMARY:

House Republicans are demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the Mueller probe's findings of no evidence. In a letter, they slammed Schiff for his "incompatible" actions, accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" information to the media. They argued that his behavior is "inconsistent" with his Constitutional responsibility. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. Schiff, however, has doubled down on his claims, saying there is "undoubtedly" collusion. Republicans attacked Schiff for promoting a "false narrative" and "undermining" the faith of the American people. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian "hacking" and "dirt" offered to the Trump campaign. The clash highlights the deepening partisan divide over the Mueller investigation and the pursuit of oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
