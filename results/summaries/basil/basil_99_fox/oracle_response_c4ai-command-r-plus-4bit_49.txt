SUMMARY: Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, citing his repeated and unfounded claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman and have undermined the faith of the American people. This comes after the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, which found no evidence of collusion. President Trump has also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking information. Despite this, Schiff has doubled down on his claims, saying that there is undoubtedly collusion and that members of the Trump campaign and family lied about meetings with Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, stating that he is being attacked for doing his job and that Democrats will not be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
