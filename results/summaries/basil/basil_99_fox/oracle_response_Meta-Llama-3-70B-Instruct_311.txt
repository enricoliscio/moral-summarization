SUMMARY:

House Republicans demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe finding no evidence. The lawmakers slammed Schiff for his "incompatible" actions, accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" information to the media. President Trump tweeted that Schiff should be "forced to resign from Congress" for his "outrageous" comments. Sen. Lindsey Graham compared Schiff to director Oliver Stone, saying he's entered "conspiracy land." Schiff, however, doubled down on his claim of collusion, saying the question of whether Trump was compromised by a foreign power was not addressed in Mueller's report. Republicans attacked Schiff for driving a "false narrative" and "undermining the faith" of the American people. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, rallied behind Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and praising his "outstanding job" in pursuing legitimate oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
