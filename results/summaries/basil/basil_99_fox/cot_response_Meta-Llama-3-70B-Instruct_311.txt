SUMMARY:
House Republicans demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, accusing him of making "lawless" and "unlawful" claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They slammed Schiff for his "lying" and "leaking" to the media, saying his actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman. President Trump tweeted that Schiff should be "forced to resign from Congress" for his "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." Schiff, a vocal critic of the president, has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration colluded with foreign powers, despite Mueller's findings. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians, saying "you might think that's okay that they lied about the meeting. I don't think that's okay." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the mounting calls to remove Schiff "absolutely ridiculous."
