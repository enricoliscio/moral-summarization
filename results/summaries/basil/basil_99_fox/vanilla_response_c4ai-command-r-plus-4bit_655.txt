SUMMARY: All Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman due to his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which have not been substantiated by the Mueller report. In a letter, they stated that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duties as chairman and that they have no faith in his ability to lead the committee. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation from Congress. Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Schiff's comments as "conspiracy land" and compared him to director Oliver Stone. Schiff has defended himself, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed calls for Schiff's removal, stating that he has done an "outstanding job" and that Democrats will not be intimidated by Republicans or the White House.
