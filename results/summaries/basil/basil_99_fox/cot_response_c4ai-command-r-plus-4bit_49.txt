SUMMARY: 
All Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of repeatedly claiming to have evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. They argue that his actions are *incompatible* with his duty as chairman and that he has *undermined* the faith of the American people. This comes after the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. President Trump has also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of *lying* and *leaking*. Schiff, however, has *defended* his position, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed calls for Schiff's resignation as *ridiculous*, stating that Democrats will not be *intimidated* or *distracted* from their pursuit of legitimate oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
