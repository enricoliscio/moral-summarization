SUMMARY:

House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee are demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the Mueller report's findings. They accuse Schiff of lying and leaking, and undermining the faith of the American people. Schiff, however, remains defiant, insisting that there is "undoubtedly" collusion and pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and Trump campaign members' meetings with Russians. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are rallying around Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and praising his "outstanding job" as chairman. The moral framing of this story is clear: Schiff's critics see him as dishonest and reckless, while his defenders view him as a champion of truth and accountability. The battle lines are drawn, with Republicans seeking to discredit Schiff and Democrats determined to defend him and push for transparency in the Mueller report.

END OF SUMMARY.
