SUMMARY:

House Republicans have demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which found no evidence of collusion. The Republicans accused Schiff of lying and leaking, and undermining the faith of the American people. Schiff, however, has doubled down on his claims, stating that there is "undoubtedly" collusion and that the question of whether Trump or his associates were compromised by a hostile foreign power was not addressed in Mueller's report. The Democrats have rallied around Schiff, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling the demands for his removal "absolutely ridiculous" and praising his outstanding work. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Schiff's pursuit of truth and accountability is being attacked by those who seek to undermine the legitimacy of the investigation and protect the president at all costs.
