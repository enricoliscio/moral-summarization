Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, which Mueller's report didn't find. They sent a letter criticizing Schiff's actions and lack of faith in his leadership. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, comparing him to Oliver Stone. Schiff defended his stance, citing Russian activities during the election. Pelosi supports Schiff, saying the calls for his resignation are ridiculous.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements: Republicans' demand, their reasons, Mueller's findings, Schiff's defense, and Pelosi's support. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”Republicans see Schiff as unfit because of his claims, while Democrats support him as doing his job.

I should structure the summary to first state the Republicans' demand, mention Mueller's report, their accusations, Schiff's defense, and then Pelosi's support. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspectives are clear.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's balanced and includes all key points without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed.
