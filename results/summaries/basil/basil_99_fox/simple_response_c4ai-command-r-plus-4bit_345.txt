SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Republicans demand Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his claims of Trump-Russia collusion evidence, citing his actions as incompatible with his duty and undermining public faith. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also call for Schiff's resignation. Schiff defends his stance, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump associates and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismisses resignation calls, stating that Schiff is being attacked for his outstanding job and that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from seeking the full Mueller report.

END OF SUMMARY.
