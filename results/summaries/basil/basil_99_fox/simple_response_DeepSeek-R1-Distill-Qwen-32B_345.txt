Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, despite Mueller's report finding no collusion. The letter they sent accuses Schiff of not fulfilling his duties and urges his resignation. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham are also criticizing Schiff, with Trump even suggesting he should resign from Congress. Schiff, however, stands by his claims, pointing to Russian interference and meetings with Trump's campaign. Democrats, including Pelosi, support Schiff, saying the calls for his resignation are ridiculous.

I need to make sure the summary captures the conflict, the reasons each side is taking their stance, and the implications of the situation. I should also highlight the moral framing, such as the accusations of lying versus the pursuit of justice. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me structure the summary: start with the Republicans' demand, their reasons, mention Mueller's findings, then Schiff's defense, the support from Democrats, and the overall context of the political battle over Mueller's report. I'll make sure to include key points like the letter, Trump's tweet, Graham's comparison, Schiff's evidence, and Pelosi's response.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article. Also, maintain a neutral tone while reflecting the moral arguments made by each side. That way, the summary will accurately represent the moral framing without bias.

In a letter, they accused Schiff of failing to fulfill his duties and urged his resignation. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his removal from Congress and Graham likening him to Oliver Stone. Schiff defended his stance, citing Russian interference and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians, while Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, supported him, calling the calls for his resignation "absolutely ridiculous." The conflict highlights the ongoing political battle over Mueller's report and the role of oversight in Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
