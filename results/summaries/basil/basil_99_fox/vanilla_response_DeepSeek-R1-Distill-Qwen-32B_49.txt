Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia. They sent a letter to him, which Fox News got, saying his actions aren't compatible with his duties. They want him to resign immediately.

The context is after Mueller's investigation, which found no collusion. President Trump also criticized Schiff, saying he lied and should resign. Sen. Lindsey Graham compared Schiff to Oliver Stone, implying he's making conspiracy theories. Schiff, though, stands by his claims, saying there's definitely collusion and pointing to Russian interference and meetings with Trump's campaign.

The article also mentions Schiff's efforts to get the full Mueller report released, with Pelosi supporting him. Democrats are standing by Schiff, saying the attacks are baseless and they're focused on getting the full report.

So, the summary should include the main points: Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation, their reasons, Mueller's findings, Schiff's defense, and the political support he has. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.
