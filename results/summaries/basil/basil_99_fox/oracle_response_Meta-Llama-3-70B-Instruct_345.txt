SUMMARY:

House Republicans demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which found no evidence of such collusion. In a letter, Republicans slammed Schiff for his "incompatible" actions, accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" information to the media. They argued that his claims were "outrageous" and bordered on "conspiracy" theories. Schiff, a vocal critic of President Trump, has maintained that there is "undoubtedly" collusion, despite Mueller's findings. Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, have lambasted Schiff, comparing him to director Oliver Stone. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian "hacking" and "dirt" offered to the Trump campaign, but Republicans remain unconvinced, accusing him of "undermining" the faith of the American people. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have rallied around Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous."

END OF SUMMARY.
