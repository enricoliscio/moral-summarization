Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, even though Mueller's investigation found no such evidence. The letter they sent accuses Schiff of not fulfilling his duties and urges his resignation. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump even calling for his resignation from Congress. Schiff defended his stance, pointing to Russian interference and meetings with Trump associates. Pelosi supports Schiff, saying the calls for his resignation are ridiculous.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." It should preserve the moral framing, meaning the tone and implications of the original text.

I should focus on the key actions and statements. Republicans are demanding Schiff's resignation over his claims despite Mueller's findings. They criticize him for his past statements and his duty as chairman. Schiff counters with evidence of Russian activities. Pelosi supports him, emphasizing the importance of getting the full Mueller report.

I need to make sure the summary captures the conflict, the reasons from both sides, and the implications of the situation. It should reflect the tension between Republicans' accusations and Schiff's defense, as well as Pelosi's support.

Let me structure this: start with Republicans' demand, mention the letter and their reasons, include Trump and Graham's criticism, then Schiff's defense, and finally Pelosi's support. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I should also make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the Republicans accusing Schiff of failing his duty and Trump calling him a liar. Schiff's stance on the importance of oversight and the full Mueller report is crucial too.

Putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within 200 words.
