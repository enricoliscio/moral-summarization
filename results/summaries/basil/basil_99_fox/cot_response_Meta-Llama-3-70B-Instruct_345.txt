SUMMARY:
Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, accusing him of repeatedly making false claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They slammed Schiff for his "lawfully" questionable actions and "unlawfully" leaking information to the media. President Trump tweeted that Schiff should be forced to resign from Congress for "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." Schiff, however, doubled down on his claim, saying "undoubtedly, there is collusion." Republicans attacked Schiff for driving a "false narrative" and "undermining the faith" of the American people. In response, Schiff pointed to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians, saying "you might think that's okay that they lied about the meeting," but "I don't think that's okay." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous." END OF SUMMARY.
