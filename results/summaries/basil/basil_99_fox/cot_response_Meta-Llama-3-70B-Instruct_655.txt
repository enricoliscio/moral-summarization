SUMMARY:
House Republicans are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to step down as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, accusing him of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking" about Trump-Russia collusion. They claim Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman and have "no faith" in his ability to lead the committee. Schiff has doubled down on his claim that there is "undoubtedly" collusion, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings. Republicans argue that Schiff is promoting a "false narrative" and "undermining the faith" of the American people. Democrats, however, are defending Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and praising him for doing an "outstanding job". The debate comes as Schiff and other Democrats push for the full release of the Mueller report. END OF SUMMARY.
