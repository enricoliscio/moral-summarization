SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Republicans demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They argue that his actions, including spreading false information about collusion, are incompatible with his duty as chairman and undermine the public's faith in the committee. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of knowingly lying and leaking information. Schiff stands by his claims, citing evidence of Russian hacking, offers of dirt on Hillary Clinton, and meetings between Trump associates and Russians. Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, defend Schiff's conduct, stating that he is doing an outstanding job and that they will not be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight and the release of the full Mueller investigation report.
END OF SUMMARY.
