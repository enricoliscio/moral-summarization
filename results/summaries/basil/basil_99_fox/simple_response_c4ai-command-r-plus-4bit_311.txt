SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Republicans demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, citing his repeated and unsupported claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They argued that Schiff's actions undermined public trust and were incompatible with his duty as chairman. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also called for Schiff's resignation, with Trump suggesting Schiff's actions were unlawful. Schiff, a vocal Trump critic, stood by his claims, pointing to Russian hacking and meetings between Trump associates and Russians. Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, stating that Republicans were attacking him due to his outstanding performance and that Democrats would not be intimidated.
