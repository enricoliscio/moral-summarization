SUMMARY:

Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which found no evidence of collusion. The lawmakers slammed Schiff for his "outrageous comments" and accused him of "lying" and "leaking" information to the media. They argued that his actions were "incompatible" with his duty as chairman and urged his immediate resignation. Schiff, a vocal critic of President Trump, has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration "colluded" with foreign powers, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russian operatives. Republicans accused Schiff of driving a "false narrative" and "undermining the faith" of the American people. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, saying he's done an "outstanding job" and that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from pursuing legitimate oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
