SUMMARY:

House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee have demanded that Chairman Adam Schiff step down, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of the Mueller probe, which found no evidence of collusion. The Republicans accused Schiff of lying and leaking information, and of undermining the faith of the American people. They argued that his actions are incompatible with his duty as Chairman and urged his immediate resignation. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. Schiff, however, has doubled down on his claims, insisting that there is evidence of collusion and that the question of whether Trump was compromised by a foreign power was not addressed in the Mueller report. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have defended Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and praising his work on the committee.

END OF SUMMARY.
