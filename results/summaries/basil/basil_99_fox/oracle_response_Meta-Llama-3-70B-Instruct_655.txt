SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe finding no evidence. The lawmakers slammed Schiff for his "incompatible" actions, accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" information to the media. President Trump tweeted that Schiff should be "forced to resign from Congress" for his "outrageous comments" that Mueller couldn't verify. Sen. Lindsey Graham compared Schiff to director Oliver Stone, saying he's entered "conspiracy land." Schiff doubled down on his claims, stating "undoubtedly, there is collusion" and that Mueller's report didn't address whether Trump or his administration were compromised by a foreign power. Republicans attacked Schiff for driving a "false narrative" and "undermining the faith" of the American people. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian "hacking" and "dirt" offered to Trump's campaign. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the attacks "absolutely ridiculous," saying Schiff has done an "outstanding job" and Democrats won't be intimidated.

END OF SUMMARY.
