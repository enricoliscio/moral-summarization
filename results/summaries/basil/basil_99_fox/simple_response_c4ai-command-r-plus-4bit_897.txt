SUMMARY: Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which contradicted Mueller's findings. They accused Schiff of undermining public faith and being unfit for his role. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and spreading conspiracy theories. Schiff defended himself, citing evidence of Russian interference and lies by Trump campaign members. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed calls for Schiff's removal, stating that he was attacked for doing his job effectively and that Democrats won't be intimidated.
