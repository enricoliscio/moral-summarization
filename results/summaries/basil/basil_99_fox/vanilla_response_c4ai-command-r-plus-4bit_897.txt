SUMMARY: All Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which were not supported by the Mueller report. They sent a letter stating that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman and that they have no faith in his ability to discharge his duties. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, while Sen. Lindsey Graham compared Schiff to conspiracy theorist Oliver Stone. Schiff has defended his claims, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed calls for Schiff's resignation, stating that he has done an outstanding job and that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from seeking the full Mueller report.
END OF SUMMARY.
