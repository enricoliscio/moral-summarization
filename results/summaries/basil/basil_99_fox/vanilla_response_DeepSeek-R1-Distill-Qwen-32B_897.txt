Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, which Mueller's report didn't find. The letter they sent says Schiff's actions aren't compatible with his duties, and they want him to resign immediately. Trump also weighed in, calling Schiff a liar and suggesting he should resign from Congress. Schiff defended his stance, pointing to Russian interference and meetings with Trump's campaign. Pelosi supports Schiff, saying the calls for his resignation are ridiculous. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points: Republicans' demand, Schiff's response, Mueller's findings, Trump's comments, and Pelosi's support. I should structure it clearly, making sure each key point is covered without getting too detailed. Let me put it all together in a coherent summary.
