Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, even though Mueller's probe found no evidence. The Republicans sent a letter accusing Schiff of lying and leaking, saying his actions are incompatible with his duties. They're also frustrated that Schiff is still pushing the collusion narrative despite Mueller's findings.

Schiff defends himself by pointing to Russian hacking, offering dirt on Clinton, and meetings with Russians. He believes these actions are not okay, even if Trump's campaign lied about them. Pelosi supports Schiff, saying the calls for his resignation are ridiculous.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words like collusion, incompatible, consistent, probe, lying, leaking, outrageous, conspiracy, colluded, investigation, false, undermining, hacking, dirt, meetings, lied, meeting, job, oversight.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation because of his collusion claims despite Mueller's findings. Mention the letter, their accusations, and their comparison to Oliver Stone. Then, include Schiff's defense and Pelosi's support. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

I should ensure the moral framing is clear, using the specified words to convey the conflict and accusations accurately.

SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, accusing him of making unsubstantiated claims about Trump-Russia collusion. In a letter, they criticized Schiff for his "incompatible" actions and lack of "consistency" with his constitutional duties, urging his resignation. This follows Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which found no evidence of collusion. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also attacked Schiff, with Trump calling him a liar and Graham comparing him to Oliver Stone. Schiff defended his stance, citing Russian hacking, offering dirt on Hillary Clinton, and Trump campaign meetings with Russians. He argued that such actions are "not okay," even if Trump's team lied about them. Schiff, along with other House leaders, has demanded the full Mueller report. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed calls for his resignation, calling them "absolutely ridiculous," and praised Schiff's "outstanding job." Democrats remain focused on securing the full Mueller report and conducting legitimate oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
