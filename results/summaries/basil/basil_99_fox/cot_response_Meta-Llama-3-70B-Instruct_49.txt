SUMMARY:
House Republicans demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, citing his "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking" about Trump-Russia collusion. They claimed his actions were "incompatible" with his duties and "undermining" the faith of the American people. Schiff, however, doubled down on his claim of "collusion" despite Mueller's findings, saying the question of whether Trump was "compromised" by a foreign power was not addressed in the report. Republicans attacked Schiff for driving a "false narrative" and promoting "outrageous" comments. In response, Schiff pointed to evidence of Russian hacking and Trump campaign members' meetings with Russians, saying "I don't think that's okay." Democrats defended Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and vowing to continue pursuing "legitimate oversight." END OF SUMMARY.
