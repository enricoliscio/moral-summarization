SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They sent a letter stating that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman and that they have no faith in his ability to perform his duties. This demand comes after the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, which found no evidence of collusion. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also called for Schiff's resignation, with Trump suggesting he should resign from Congress. Schiff has defended his claims, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed calls for Schiff's resignation, stating that he has done an outstanding job and that Democrats won't be intimidated.
