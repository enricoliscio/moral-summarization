Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand what's happening.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has been claiming there's evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia. The letter they sent accuses him of not fulfilling his duties and urges his resignation. They mention that Mueller's probe found no collusion, so they're using that to back their demand.

Schiff, on the other hand, is standing by his claims, saying there's definitely collusion. He points to Russian hacking, offering dirt on Clinton, and meetings with Trump's campaign and family. He's also pushing for the full Mueller report to be released.

The article also mentions Pelosi supporting Schiff, calling the calls for his resignation ridiculous. She's with him in trying to get the full report.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The Republicans are framing Schiff as untrustworthy and unfit for his position because he's making claims that Mueller didn't find evidence for. They're accusing him of misleading the public. Schiff is framing himself as a defender of truth and accountability, emphasizing the need for transparency and oversight. Pelosi supports him, framing the Republican demands as politically motivated and an attack on proper oversight.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points without going over 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating the Republicans' demand, their reasons, Schiff's defense, and Pelosi's support. I'll also highlight the moral aspects each side is emphasizing.

Let me draft the summary:

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of misleading claims about Trump-Russia collusion, which Mueller's report found no evidence for. They argue his actions undermine his role and the committee's integrity. Schiff defended his stance, citing Russian interference and Trump campaign meetings with Russians, insisting collusion exists. Pelosi criticized the calls for Schiff's resignation as baseless, emphasizing the need for transparency and oversight. The conflict highlights opposing views on truthfulness, accountability, and the proper role of congressional oversight.

That's concise and captures the moral framing. I think this meets the requirements.
