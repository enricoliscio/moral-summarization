SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They argued that his actions were incompatible with his duty as chairman and that he had undermined the faith of the American people. This demand follows the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, which found no evidence of collusion. President Trump and other top Republicans, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of knowingly lying and leaking information. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the calls for Schiff's resignation as "absolutely ridiculous," stating that he was being attacked for doing his job effectively and that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from seeking the full Mueller report.

END OF SUMMARY.
