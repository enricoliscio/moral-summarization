SUMMARY:

House Republicans are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to step down as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings to the contrary. In a letter, they slammed Schiff for his "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking" and urged his immediate resignation. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump demanding his resignation from Congress. Schiff, however, remains defiant, claiming that "undoubtedly, there is collusion" and that Mueller's report did not investigate whether Trump or his associates were compromised by a hostile foreign power. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have rallied around Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and praising his work on the committee.

END OF SUMMARY.
