SUMMARY:

All Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe finding no such evidence. In a letter, the lawmakers slammed Schiff for his claims in the media and urged his immediate resignation as chairman. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. Schiff has maintained that there is "undoubtedly" collusion between Trump and foreign powers, despite Mueller's findings. The Republicans confronted Schiff at a Russia-themed hearing, accusing him of driving a "false narrative" and undermining the faith of the American people. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has defended Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous."

END OF SUMMARY.
