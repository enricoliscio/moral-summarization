SUMMARY:
Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, accusing him of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking" about Trump-Russia collusion. They claimed his actions were "incompatible" with his duty as chairman and urged his "immediate resignation." President Trump tweeted that Schiff should be "forced to resign from Congress" for his "false narrative" about collusion. Schiff, however, doubled down on his claim, saying "undoubtedly, there is collusion" despite Mueller's findings. Republicans attacked Schiff for "undermining the faith" of the American people and driving a "false narrative." Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the mounting calls to remove Schiff "absolutely ridiculous." Democrats vowed to continue pursuing "legitimate oversight" and securing the release of the full Mueller report. END OF SUMMARY.
