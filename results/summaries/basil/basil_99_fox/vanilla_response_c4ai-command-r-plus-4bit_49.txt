SUMMARY: All Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to step down as chairman due to his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which have not been substantiated by the Mueller investigation. In a letter, they stated that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman and that they have no faith in his ability to perform his duties. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also added their voices to the call for Schiff's resignation. Schiff has defended himself, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed the calls for Schiff's removal as "absolutely ridiculous," stating that he has done an outstanding job and that Democrats will not be intimidated or distracted from seeking the full Mueller report.

END OF SUMMARY.
