SUMMARY:

All Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe finding no evidence. In a letter, the lawmakers slammed Schiff for his claims in the media, stating that his actions are "incompatible with his duty as Chairman of this Committee." President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. Schiff has doubled down on his claim of collusion, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, calling the mounting calls to remove him "absolutely ridiculous."

END OF SUMMARY.
