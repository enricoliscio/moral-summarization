Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has repeatedly claimed there's evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, despite Mueller's report finding no such evidence. The Republicans sent a letter to Schiff, criticizing his actions and demanding his resignation. President Trump even tweeted about Schiff, accusing him of lying and leaking information. Sen. Lindsey Graham compared Schiff to Oliver Stone, suggesting his claims are outlandish.

Schiff, on the other hand, stands by his claims, pointing to Russian interference in the election, offering dirt on Clinton, and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. Democrats, including Pelosi, support Schiff, calling the calls for his resignation ridiculous and emphasizing the need to release the full Mueller report.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary that's no more than 200 words. I should highlight the main conflict: Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation over his collusion claims, Mueller's findings, Schiff's defense, and the Democratic response. I need to maintain the moral framing, so I'll note the accusations of lying and the push for accountability.

I should structure the summary to first state the Republicans' demand, then mention Mueller's report, Schiff's stance, the reactions from Trump and Graham, and finally the Democratic support for Schiff. I'll make sure to keep each point concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all key aspects without being too detailed. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and objective, preserving the moral elements presented in the article.

Lindsey Graham also attacked Schiff, with Trump calling him a liar and Graham comparing him to Oliver Stone.
