SUMMARY:

Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings to the contrary. In a letter, the lawmakers accused Schiff of making false claims and undermining the faith of the American people. During a hearing, Republicans confronted Schiff, with Rep. Michael Conaway attacking him for driving a "false narrative" and demanding his immediate resignation. Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed the calls to remove Schiff, saying Democrats won't be intimidated and will continue to pursue legitimate oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
