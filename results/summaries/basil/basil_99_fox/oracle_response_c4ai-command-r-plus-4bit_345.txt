SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They argued that his actions were morally incompatible with his duty as chairman and undermined the faith of the American people. This demand came after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion. President Trump and other top Republicans, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of knowingly lying and leaking information. Schiff defended himself by pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, stating that he was being attacked for doing an outstanding job and that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
