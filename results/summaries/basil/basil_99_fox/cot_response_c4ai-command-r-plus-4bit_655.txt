SUMMARY: 
Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has called on Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his repeated and baseless claims of Trump-Russia collusion. In a letter signed by all the committee's Republicans and delivered during a heated hearing, they stated that Schiff's actions were "incompatible with [his] duty as Chairman" and that they had "no faith" in his ability to perform his duties. This demand comes after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion. President Trump and other top Republicans have also called for Schiff's resignation, with the President suggesting that Schiff "knowingly and unlawfully lied and leaked." Schiff, a vocal critic of the President, has stood by his claims and defended his position during the hearing, pointing to Russian hacking and meetings between Trump's campaign and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed calls for Schiff's resignation as "ridiculous," praising his work as "outstanding." Democrats have vowed not to be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight and the release of the full Mueller report. 

END OF SUMMARY.
