SUMMARY:
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have publicly demanded the resignation of Rep. Adam Schiff from his position as chairman, accusing him of spreading false claims about Trump-Russia collusion. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his duties and have undermined the faith of the American people. Schiff, a vocal critic of President Trump, has stood by his claims, stating that there is "undoubtedly" collusion. This incident has sparked controversy, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defending Schiff, calling the calls for his resignation "ridiculous," while others have accused him of being intimidated and distracted from legitimate oversight duties. The committee Republicans' letter to Schiff expressed their lack of faith in his ability to lead the committee and urged him to step down immediately. The demand comes in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. President Trump and other prominent Republicans have joined the call for Schiff's resignation, citing his "unlawful" behavior. Meanwhile, Schiff continues to assert the existence of collusion based on evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians.
