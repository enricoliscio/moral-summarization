SUMMARY:

All Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) step down as chairman, citing his repeated claims of having evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which found no such evidence. In a letter, the lawmakers accused Schiff of making false claims and undermining the faith of the American people. During a hearing, Schiff defended himself, pointing to evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. However, Republicans on the committee have lost faith in his ability to lead the committee impartially. President Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also criticized Schiff, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has defended Schiff, calling the attacks "absolutely ridiculous" and praising his work on the committee.

END OF SUMMARY.
