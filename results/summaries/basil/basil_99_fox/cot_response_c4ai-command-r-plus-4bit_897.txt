SUMMARY: 
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, citing his repeated and unfounded claims of Trump-Russia collusion. They have penned a letter, slamming Schiff for his "incompatible" behavior and expressing their "lack of faith" in his ability to execute his duties. This comes after the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, which found no evidence of collusion. President Trump has also demanded Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." Despite this, Schiff has stood by his claims, stating there is "undoubtedly collusion." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, calling the calls for his resignation "ridiculous" and stating that Democrats will not be intimidated or distracted from securing the full Mueller report and conducting legitimate oversight. 
END OF SUMMARY.
