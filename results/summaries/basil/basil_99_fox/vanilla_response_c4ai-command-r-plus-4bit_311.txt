SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which were not supported by the Mueller report. In a letter, they stated that Schiff's actions were incompatible with his duty as chairman and that they had no faith in his ability to discharge his duties. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation from Congress. Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Schiff for his comments, comparing him to conspiracy theorist Oliver Stone. Schiff has defended himself, citing evidence of Russian hacking and meetings between Trump campaign members and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has supported Schiff, calling the calls for his removal "absolutely ridiculous." She stated that Democrats won't be intimidated or distracted from their pursuit of legitimate oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
