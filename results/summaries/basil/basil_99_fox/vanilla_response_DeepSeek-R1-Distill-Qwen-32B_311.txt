Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman. They're upset because Schiff has repeatedly claimed there's evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. They sent a letter to him, which Fox News obtained, stating that his actions are incompatible with his duty and urging his resignation.

Mueller's probe found no collusion, but Schiff insists there's collusion. President Trump even tweeted that Schiff should resign from Congress. Sen. Lindsey Graham compared Schiff to Oliver Stone, saying his comments are not helpful. Schiff defended his stance, pointing to Russian activities during the election and Trump campaign meetings with Russians. Pelosi supports Schiff, calling the demands "absolutely ridiculous," and says Democrats won't be distracted from getting the full Mueller report.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the Republican demand, Mueller's findings, Schiff's defense, Trump's tweet, Graham's comment, and Pelosi's support. Keep it concise and cover all key points.
