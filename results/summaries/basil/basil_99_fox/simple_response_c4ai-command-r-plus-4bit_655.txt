SUMMARY: Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his repeated claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which were not supported by Mueller's findings. They argued that Schiff's actions undermined his ability to lead the committee effectively and fairly. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation from Congress, accusing him of lying and leaking information unlawfully. Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Schiff for making unverified and conspiratorial claims. Schiff, however, defended his stance, citing evidence of Russian interference and contacts between Trump associates and Russians. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, calling the calls for his resignation "ridiculous" and stating that he was being attacked for doing his job effectively.
