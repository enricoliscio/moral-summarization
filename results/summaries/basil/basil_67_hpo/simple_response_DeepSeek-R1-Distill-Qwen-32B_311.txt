Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Vicente Fox criticizing Enrique Peña Nieto for meeting Donald Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Fox is harshly criticizing Peña Nieto for inviting Trump, especially before Trump's immigration speech. Fox says Trump isn't welcome in Mexico, and most Mexicans dislike him because of his controversial statements about building a wall and negative remarks about Mexicans. 

Trump accepted the invitation, while Clinton declined, saying she'd speak at the appropriate time. Fox warns that Peña Nieto is taking a political risk by meeting Trump, calling him a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump. Fox believes Trump is using Mexico to boost his polls and that Peña Nieto's move is a mistake. He also mentions Fox's earlier criticism of Trump and their exchange on Twitter.

I need to make sure the summary includes Fox's criticism, the context of Trump's visit, the political risks involved, and the moral implications. I should keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing is clear, like Fox's warnings about Mexico being used and the potential betrayal by Peña Nieto.

Let me structure it: start with Fox's criticism, mention Trump's visit, Fox's reasons (political risk, using Mexico), and end with the implications. Make sure to include the key points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet in Mexico, just hours before Trump's immigration speech in Arizona. Fox stated that Trump is "not welcome" in Mexico, as 130 million Mexicans reject his message, which includes controversial claims about building a border wall and fear-mongering about "rapists" and drug dealers. Trump, who has long criticized Mexico, accepted the invitation, while Hillary Clinton declined, citing a desire to address the issue at an appropriate time. Fox warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" for meeting Trump, arguing that Trump is using Mexico to boost his faltering poll numbers. Fox accused Peña Nieto of making a "desperate" and "opportunistic" move, urging the U.S. public to see Trump's true nature. Fox also referenced his earlier criticism of Trump, vowing Mexico would never pay for the wall, and later inviting Trump to visit. Trump mocked Fox's invitation in a tweet, to which Fox responded by accusing Trump of lying and disrespecting Mexico. END OF SUMMARY.
