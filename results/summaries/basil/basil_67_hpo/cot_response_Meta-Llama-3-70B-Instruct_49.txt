SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is "not welcome to Mexico" and that his message is rejected by the 130 million people of Mexico. Fox warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he does not stand up to Trump, who has spent over a year "fear-mongering" about Mexico and its leaders. Fox accused Trump of using the meeting to "boost his sinking poll numbers" and described the move as "opportunistic" and "desperate". Fox also called Trump a "false prophet" who is "cheating everybody". The meeting has sparked controversy, with Fox urging Peña Nieto to show "respect" to Mexico and its people. END OF SUMMARY.
