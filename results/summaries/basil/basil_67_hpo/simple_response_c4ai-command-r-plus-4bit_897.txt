SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized incumbent President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, citing Trump's history of offensive remarks about Mexico and its people. Fox argued that Trump was using the visit to boost his poll numbers and that Peña Nieto risked being seen as a traitor if he did not stand up to Trump. He also highlighted the potential damage the meeting could cause to Peña Nieto's already low approval rating. In response to Trump's claim that Fox had invited him to Mexico, Fox clarified that the invitation was extended as an opportunity for Trump to apologize to Mexicans for his offensive remarks. Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's divisive and offensive rhetoric demonstrates a commitment to defending the dignity and respect of Mexicans in the face of harmful stereotypes and generalizations.
