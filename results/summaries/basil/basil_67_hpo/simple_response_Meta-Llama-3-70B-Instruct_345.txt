SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Pe単a Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Fox accused Trump of using Mexico to boost his poll numbers and warned Pe単a Nieto that hosting Trump would be a huge political risk, potentially making him seem like a "traitor" to Mexicans. Fox also called Trump's move "opportunistic" and "desperate", urging US citizens to see through Trump's false promises. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Pe単a Nieto, with Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric and Pe単a Nieto's low approval ratings making the encounter potentially damaging to both leaders.

END OF SUMMARY.
