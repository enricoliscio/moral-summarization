Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet in Mexico. Fox is upset because Trump has been very negative towards Mexico, talking about building a wall and using fear-mongering language. He says Trump isn't welcome and that Peña Nieto is taking a political risk by meeting him. Fox thinks Peña Nieto is seen as a traitor if he doesn't stand up to Trump.

I should note the key points: Fox's criticism, Trump's invitation, the political risks for both Peña Nieto and Trump, Fox's history of opposing Trump, and the moral stance against Trump's actions.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements, like Fox's concern about Mexico's reputation and Trump's manipulation. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I should start by stating Fox's criticism, mention Trump's invitation, then Fox's reasoning about the political risks and the perception of betrayal. Also, include the context of Trump's campaign promises and Fox's past comments.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the essential moral points without getting bogged down in details. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet in Mexico, just hours before Trump's immigration speech in Arizona. Fox condemned Trump, stating, "He is not welcome to Mexico," and accused Trump of spreading harmful messages about Mexicans. Trump accepted the invitation, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton declined. Fox warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" for meeting Trump, arguing that Trump is exploiting Mexico to boost his failing campaign. Fox also criticized Trump's history of anti-Mexican rhetoric, including promises to build a border wall and fear-mongering about "rapists" and drug dealers. Fox expressed hope that U.S. voters would see Trump's opportunism and recognize him as a "false prophet." Earlier, Fox had apologized for using profanity when opposing Trump but still invited him to visit Mexico to learn about the country. Trump responded by highlighting Fox's conflicting statements. Fox accused Trump of disrespecting Mexico and demanded accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
