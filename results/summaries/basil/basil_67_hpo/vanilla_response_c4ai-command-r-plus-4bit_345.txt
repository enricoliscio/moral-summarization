SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump's message is rejected by Mexicans and that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a traitor if he does not stand up to Trump. He also accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his poll numbers and warned that it was a desperate and opportunistic move. Trump's visit to Mexico is his first meeting with a foreign leader as a presidential nominee and has sparked controversy due to his previous controversial statements about Mexico and its people. Peña Nieto's approval rating has also been low due to corruption scandals. Fox had previously made headlines for his expletive-laden criticism of Trump's wall proposal. Trump noted Fox's previous invitation, but Fox countered that it was an invitation to apologize to Mexicans.
END OF SUMMARY.
