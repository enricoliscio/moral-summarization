SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico. Fox argued that Trump's visit was opportunistic and that Peña Nieto would be seen as a traitor if he did not stand up to Trump's offensive rhetoric about Mexico. Fox warned that the meeting was a desperate and risky move that would not be well-received by Mexicans, who reject Trump's message. He accused Trump of cheating and fear-mongering, and previously railed against Trump's promise to build a wall along the Mexico-US border, stating that Mexico would never pay for it. Trump's acceptance of the invitation, despite his negative sentiments towards Mexico, sparked controversy and was seen as a move to boost his poll numbers. Fox urged US citizens to recognize Trump's true nature and called on Peña Nieto to use the meeting to stand up for Mexico's dignity.
