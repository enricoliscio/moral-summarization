SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, just hours before Trump's highly anticipated speech on immigration in Arizona. Fox accused Trump of using the visit to boost his poll numbers and warned Peña Nieto that he risked being seen as "a traitor" if he failed to stand up to Trump's offensive rhetoric about Mexico. Fox's criticism reflects the widespread disapproval in Mexico towards Trump, who has spent his campaign demonizing the country and its people with false and racist claims. Trump's acceptance of the invitation, a first for a foreign leader, is seen as a desperate and opportunistic move that may backfire, especially if he fails to moderate his stance and continues to offend the Mexican people. Fox, who previously apologized for his own expletive-laden outburst against Trump, emphasized that Mexico will not tolerate being disrespected and manipulated for political gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
