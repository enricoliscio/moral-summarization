SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly condemned current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Trump has previously made derogatory comments about Mexico and its leaders, promising to build a wall on the border and fear-mongering about "rapists" and drug dealers. Fox warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump, and that hosting Trump would be a huge political risk. Fox accused Trump of using Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers and called the meeting a "desperate move" that won't work. The former president also tweeted that Trump should show respect to Mexico and its people.
