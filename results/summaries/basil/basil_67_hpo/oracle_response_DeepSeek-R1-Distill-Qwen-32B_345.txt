Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author, such as fearmongering, scandals, using, mistake, cheating, stop, and lying. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president, is criticizing Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump. Fox is upset because Trump has made negative statements about Mexico and Mexicans, which Fox refers to as fearmongering. He also mentions that Peña Nieto is taking a political risk by meeting Trump, which could be seen as a mistake. Fox accuses Trump of using Mexico to boost his polls, implying cheating. Additionally, Fox accuses Trump of lying and asks him to stop.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral terms. I'll start by stating Fox's criticism, then mention the reasons like fearmongering and the wall. I'll include Fox's warning about Peña Nieto being seen as a traitor and the risks involved. Then, I'll note Fox's accusations of Trump using Mexico and cheating, as well as his call for Trump to stop lying. I'll end with Fox's invitation for Trump to apologize, emphasizing respect.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including all the key points and moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence captures a main point without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox sharply criticized President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet in Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and warning that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" for hosting the Republican nominee. Fox accused Trump of "fearmongering" and "using" Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers, while also denouncing Trump's controversial statements about building a border wall and his derogatory remarks about Mexicans. Fox emphasized that Trump's message is "not welcome" in Mexico, with 130 million people rejecting his rhetoric. He also criticized Trump for "cheating" and "lying," urging him to "stop" exploiting Mexico. Trump, in response, highlighted Fox's earlier invitation to visit Mexico, which Fox denied, insisting Trump should apologize for his offensive comments. The meeting, Trump's first with a foreign leader as a nominee, has drawn criticism for its opportunism and potential political risks for both leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
