SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and a "desperate move" to boost Trump's sinking poll numbers. Fox accused Trump of "fear-mongering" and "cheating" the public with his rhetoric on Mexico and its leaders. He warned that if Peña Nieto doesn't stand up to Trump, he'll be viewed as a "traitor" by the Mexican people. Fox also criticized Trump for "using" Mexico and its president to further his own interests. This meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, with Fox urging the U.S. public to "stop" believing Trump's lies and "see what is behind" his false promises. Fox had previously apologized for using profanity to reject Trump's proposal for a border wall, but Trump twisted the invitation to make it seem like Fox was welcoming him to Mexico.

END OF SUMMARY.
