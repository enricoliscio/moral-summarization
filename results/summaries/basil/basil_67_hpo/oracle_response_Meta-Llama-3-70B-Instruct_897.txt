SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, calling it a "big mistake" and a "desperate move" to boost Trump's sinking poll numbers. Fox accused Trump of "using" Mexico and Peña Nieto to further his own interests, and warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he didn't stand up to Trump's "fear-mongering" rhetoric. Fox also accused Trump of "cheating" and "lying" about his intentions, and urged him to "stop" disrespecting Mexico. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, with Trump's history of "scandals" and Peña Nieto's own low approval ratings due to corruption "scandals". Fox's strong words come after Trump's year-long tirade against Mexico, promising to build a wall and claiming Mexicans are "rapists" and drug dealers.
