SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump has offended Mexico and its people with his rhetoric and that Peña Nieto would be seen as a "traitor" if he did not stand up to Trump during the meeting. He also accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his poll numbers and warned that it was a desperate and opportunistic move that would not be well-received by Mexicans. Trump has made controversial statements about Mexico and has promised to build a wall along the border, which he claims Mexico will pay for. Peña Nieto's approval rating has been low due to corruption scandals, and he may be seeking to improve his image with the meeting. Fox's comments highlight the risks of Trump's meeting with a foreign leader, which is a first for him as a presidential nominee.
END OF SUMMARY.
