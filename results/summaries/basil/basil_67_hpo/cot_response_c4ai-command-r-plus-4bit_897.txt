SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox harshly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump is not welcome in Mexico due to his offensive and racist rhetoric towards Mexicans, including his promise to build a wall along the border and his fear-mongering about "rapists" and drug dealers. Fox warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a traitor if he does not stand up to Trump during their meeting, as it could be perceived that he is being used to boost Trump's poll numbers. He also highlighted the potential damage to Peña Nieto's already fragile reputation due to corruption scandals, stating that the meeting is a desperate and opportunistic move. Fox urged U.S. citizens to see through Trump's false prophet image and recognize his deceit.
