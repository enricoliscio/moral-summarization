SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox harshly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that his message is rejected by the Mexican people. He warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a traitor if he does not stand up to Trump and accused him of using the meeting opportunistically to boost his poll numbers. Fox also referenced his earlier expletive-laden outburst against Trump, for which he had apologized, and accused Trump of lying about the nature of the invitation. The meeting, which is Trump's first with a foreign leader as a nominee, has been criticized as a desperate move that could backfire, given Trump's history of offensive remarks about Mexico and its citizens. Fox's stance reflects the sentiment of many Mexicans who oppose Trump's candidacy due to his derogatory characterizations and promises of building a wall along the border. The interview underscores the complex dynamics of international relations and the potential pitfalls of seeking political gains through controversial meetings.
