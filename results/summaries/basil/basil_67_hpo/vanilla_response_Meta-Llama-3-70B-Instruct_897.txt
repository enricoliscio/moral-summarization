SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Trump has been vocal about building a wall on the US-Mexico border and making Mexico pay for it. Fox warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump. Fox also accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his sinking poll numbers. Trump's meeting with Peña Nieto is seen as a risky move for his candidacy, and Fox hopes that US public opinion will see through Trump's "false prophet" persona. The meeting comes ahead of Trump's speech on immigration in Arizona.
