Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet him in Mexico. Fox is upset because Trump has been making negative statements about Mexico, like promising a wall and calling Mexicans rapists. He says Trump isn't welcome and that Peña Nieto is taking a political risk by meeting him. Fox thinks Peña Nieto might be seen as a traitor if he doesn't stand up to Trump. He also mentions that Trump is using this meeting to boost his polls, which are low. 

Peña Nieto also invited Hillary Clinton, but she's waiting for the right time. Fox is frustrated, saying Trump is using Mexico opportunistically, and he hopes Americans realize Trump's insincerity. Earlier, Fox had apologized for using harsh language about Trump but still invited him to Mexico to learn the real country.

So, the moral framing here is that Fox sees Peña Nieto as betraying Mexico by meeting Trump, who has been disrespectful and harmful to Mexico's image. Fox is concerned about Mexico's dignity and the political risks involved for Peña Nieto. He's also critical of Trump's manipulative tactics to improve his campaign.

I need to make sure the summary captures Fox's criticism, the context of Trump's negative rhetoric, the political risks for Peña Nieto, and the moral stance against Trump's actions. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure this: start with Fox's criticism, mention Trump's history, Peña Nieto's invitation, Fox's warning about traitorous perception, the political risks, and Fox's view on Trump's opportunism. Also, include the note about Clinton and Fox's earlier invitation.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point but ensure all key elements are included without losing the moral perspective.
