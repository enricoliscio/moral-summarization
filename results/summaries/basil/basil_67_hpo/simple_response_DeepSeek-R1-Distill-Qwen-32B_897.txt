Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral perspective.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet him in Mexico. Fox is really against this meeting, saying Trump isn't welcome and that Mexicans don't like him because of his harsh comments about Mexico and immigration. Trump has been making negative statements about Mexico, promising a wall and using fearmongering about immigrants.

Fox thinks Peña Nieto is taking a big political risk by meeting Trump. He warns that if Peña Nieto doesn't stand up to Trump, he'll be seen as a traitor. Fox also accuses Trump of using Mexico to boost his polls, which are sinking. He calls Trump a "false prophet" and a liar, saying this move is desperate and won't work.

Earlier, Fox had harsh words for Trump, even using expletives, but later apologized and invited Trump to Mexico. Trump responded by pointing out Fox's invitation after the apology, which Fox denies, saying he invited Trump to apologize to Mexicans and to show respect.

So, the moral framing here is about loyalty, respect, and standing up against harmful rhetoric. Fox is emphasizing that Mexico shouldn't be used by Trump, and that Peña Nieto should protect Mexico's interests and reputation. There's a sense of betrayal if Peña Nieto meets Trump, given Trump's negative stance towards Mexico.

I need to make sure the summary captures Fox's criticism, the reasons behind it (Trump's negative comments, the political risk for Peña Nieto), and the moral implications of Mexico being used by Trump. Also, the back-and-forth between Fox and Trump about the invitation should be included to show the tension.

I'll structure the summary to first state Fox's criticism, then explain Trump's actions and the risks, Fox's warning about betrayal, and the exchange between Fox and Trump regarding the invitation. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the tokens as specified.

Let me check the word count as I draft it. Make sure each point is concise but covers the key moral aspects. Avoid getting too detailed on the political strategies but focus on the moral stance Fox is taking against Trump and Peña Nieto's decision.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet in Mexico, calling Trump "not welcome" and rejecting his harmful rhetoric. Fox warns Peña Nieto risks being seen as a traitor if he doesn't oppose Trump, accusing Trump of exploiting Mexico to boost his faltering campaign. Fox condemns Trump's negative comments about Mexico, including promises of a border wall and fearmongering about immigrants. The meeting, Trump's first with a foreign leader as a nominee, could backfire politically, as seen with Mitt Romney's 2012 visit to Israel. Fox also accuses Peña Nieto of taking a political risk, as his approval ratings are already low due to corruption scandals. Fox emphasizes the importance of standing up against Trump's divisive rhetoric, highlighting the moral imperative to protect Mexico's dignity and interests. END OF SUMMARY.
