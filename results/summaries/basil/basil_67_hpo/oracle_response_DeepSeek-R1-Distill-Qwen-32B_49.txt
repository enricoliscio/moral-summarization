Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user specified that I should use the words: fearmongering, scandals, using, mistake, cheating, stop, lying. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump. Fox is upset because Trump has been criticizing Mexico, and he feels Peña Nieto is making a political mistake by meeting Trump. 

I need to make sure to include the moral terms. Fox accuses Trump of fearmongering, so I'll note that. Peña Nieto's approval rating is low due to scandals, which is another term to include. Fox says Peña Nieto is using Mexico for Trump's benefit, so "using" is relevant. He calls the meeting a mistake and accuses Trump of cheating. Fox tells Trump to stop lying, and mentions that Trump is lying about the invitation. 

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely. I'll start by stating Fox's criticism, mention Trump's history of fearmongering, Peña Nieto's low ratings and scandals, Fox's warning about being seen as a traitor, and the mutual accusations between Fox and Trump about lying. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include all the required moral terms.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet in Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and warning that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" for hosting the Republican nominee. Fox accused Trump of "fearmongering" and "using" Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers. Trump, who has spent over a year attacking Mexico and its leaders, accepted the invitation, while Hillary Clinton declined. Fox warned that Trump is "cheating" everyone and urged him to "stop lying" about Mexico. Trump responded by mocking Fox's earlier apology for using profanity, claiming Fox had invited him to Mexico. Fox denied this, accusing Trump of "lying" and disrespecting Mexico. The meeting, Trump's first with a foreign leader as a nominee, is seen as a risky move, with Fox calling it an "opportunistic" and "desperate" attempt to salvage Trump's campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
