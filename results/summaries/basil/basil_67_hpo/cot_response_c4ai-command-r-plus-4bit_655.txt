SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized Enrique Pe単a Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet him in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump has offended Mexicans with his hateful rhetoric and that Pe単a Nieto would be seen as a traitor if he did not stand up to Trump during their meeting. He further characterized Trump's visit as a desperate and opportunistic move, accusing him of cheating and lying. Fox himself has been vocal in his rejection of Trump, famously stating that Mexico would never pay for the wall that Trump has proposed. The meeting between Trump and Pe単a Nieto is seen as a risky move for both parties, with the potential to backfire politically. Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, has chosen not to attend. Fox warned Pe単a Nieto that he must demand respect from Trump and stand up for Mexico's interests, or risk losing the support of his people.
END OF SUMMARY.
