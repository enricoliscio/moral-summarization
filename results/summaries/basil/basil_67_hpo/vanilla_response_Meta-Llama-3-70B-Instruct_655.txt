SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Pe単a Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Trump has been vocal about building a wall on the US-Mexico border and making Mexico pay for it, as well as making derogatory comments about Mexicans. Fox warned that if Pe単a Nieto does not stand up to Trump, he will be viewed as a "traitor" by the Mexican people. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Pe単a Nieto, with Trump trying to boost his sinking poll numbers and Pe単a Nieto trying to improve his image amid corruption scandals. Fox had previously railed against Trump, promising that Mexico would never pay for the wall, and had even invited Trump to visit Mexico and learn about the country.
