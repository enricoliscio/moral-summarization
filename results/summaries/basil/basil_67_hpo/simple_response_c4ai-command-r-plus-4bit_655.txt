SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet him in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump's presence was not welcome in Mexico due to his offensive remarks about the country and his promise to build a wall along the border. He warned that Peña Nieto would be seen as a traitor if he did not stand up to Trump during their meeting. Trump's visit is seen as a risky move, both for his candidacy and for Peña Nieto's already low approval rating. Fox also highlighted the opportunistic nature of the meeting, suggesting that Trump was using Mexico to boost his poll numbers. He urged U.S. citizens to see through Trump's false promises and opportunistic actions. Fox had previously invited Trump to come and learn about the real Mexico, but only after apologizing for his offensive remarks.
END OF SUMMARY.
