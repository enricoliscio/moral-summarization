Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump. The user provided the article and specified that the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.", keeping it under 200 words.

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The key elements are Fox's criticism of Peña Nieto for meeting Trump, the context of Trump's visit, Fox's strong language, and the implications for both Peña Nieto and Trump.

I should identify the main actors: Vicente Fox, Enrique Peña Nieto, Donald Trump. The main event is Fox's criticism, the invitation to Trump, and the political implications. Also, Trump's history of negative statements about Mexico is important context.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning Fox's criticism, then the reason (Trump's invitation), Fox's quotes about Trump not being welcome, and the political risks involved for Peña Nieto. I should also include Fox's warning about being seen as a traitor and his view of Trump as manipulative. Finally, I'll note the exchange between Fox and Trump regarding the invitation and apology.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covers all key points, and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid including too much detail, focusing on the essential information without getting bogged down in specifics.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first introduce Fox's criticism, then explain the context, include relevant quotes, discuss the political implications, and conclude with the exchange between Fox and Trump. This should cover all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet him in Mexico, just hours before Trump's immigration speech in Arizona. Fox stated that Trump is "not welcome" in Mexico, with 130 million Mexicans rejecting his message. Trump, who has long criticized Mexico and its leaders, accepted Peña Nieto's invitation, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton declined to meet him at this time. Fox warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" for hosting Trump, accusing him of taking a political risk to boost Trump's sinking poll numbers. Fox also criticized Trump for manipulating Mexico and urged U.S. citizens to recognize Trump's opportunism. Earlier, Fox had apologized for using profanity when railing against Trump and invited him to Mexico, a point Trump highlighted in a tweet. Fox responded by accusing Trump of lying and demanded respect for Mexico. END OF SUMMARY.
