SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, given Trump's history of fearmongering and offensive rhetoric towards Mexico and its people. Fox accused Trump of using the visit opportunistically to boost his poll numbers and warned Peña Nieto that he would be seen as a "traitor" if he did not stand up to Trump. He also highlighted the risk of the meeting, suggesting it could be a desperate move that might not work in Trump's favor. Fox himself had previously invited Trump to Mexico to learn about the country and apologize to Mexicans for his offensive remarks. However, Trump's tweet about the invitation was misleading, as Fox's intention was for Trump to acknowledge his offensive behavior. Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's actions and his defense of Mexico's interests demonstrate his commitment to upholding ethical values in the face of political opportunism and disrespectful behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
