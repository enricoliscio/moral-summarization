Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet him. Fox is really against this meeting, saying Trump isn't welcome in Mexico and that most Mexicans dislike him. Trump has been criticizing Mexico a lot, talking about building a wall and making negative comments about Mexicans. 

Peña Nieto's approval ratings are low because of corruption scandals, so this meeting might be a political risk for him. Fox warns that if Peña Nieto doesn't stand up to Trump, he'll be seen as a traitor. Trump, on the other hand, is using this meeting to improve his campaign, and Fox thinks it's a desperate move. There's also a bit about Fox inviting Trump earlier, which Trump pointed out, but Fox clarified he wanted Trump to apologize.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Fox's criticism, Trump's invitation, Fox's reasons, Trump's history, the political risks, and the implications for both Peña Nieto and Trump. I'll make sure to mention the wall, the negative remarks, and Fox's warning about being seen as a traitor. Also, include the part about Fox's previous invitation and Trump's response.

Let me structure this: start with Fox criticizing Peña Nieto, mention the invitation and Fox's reasons, Trump's actions, the political risks, Fox's warning, and end with the implications. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
