SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized incumbent Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to Mexico, just before a highly anticipated speech on immigration in Arizona. Fox called the meeting a "big mistake," arguing that Trump is using Mexico and Peña Nieto to boost his "sinking" poll numbers. He warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump, who has spent over a year offending Mexicans with his fear-mongering and promises to build a wall on the border. Mitt Romney's trip to Israel during his campaign is recalled as a cautionary tale. Fox previously railed against Trump's offensive comments, famously stating that Mexico would "never pay for that fucking wall." He later apologized and invited Trump to learn about the real Mexico, an invitation Trump misleadingly cited on Twitter. Fox responded by accusing Trump of lying and disrespecting Mexico. Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's divisive rhetoric and actions resonates with many Mexicans who reject Trump's message.
END OF SUMMARY.
