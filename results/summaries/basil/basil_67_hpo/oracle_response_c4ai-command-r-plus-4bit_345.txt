SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, calling it a "big mistake." Fox accused Trump of fearmongering about Mexico and its people, and warned that Peña Nieto would be seen as "a traitor" if he did not stand up to Trump during the visit. He also criticized Trump for his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it, stating that Mexico "is not yours to play with." Trump's history of cheating and lying was also brought up by Fox, who called his visit a "desperate and opportunistic move." Meanwhile, Peña Nieto's approval rating has suffered due to corruption scandals, and his invitation to Trump may be seen as an attempt to bolster his own image. Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic opponent, declined a similar invitation.
END OF SUMMARY.
