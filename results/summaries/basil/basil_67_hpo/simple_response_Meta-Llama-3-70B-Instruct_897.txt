SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly condemned current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, just hours before Trump's speech on immigration in Arizona. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that the Mexican people reject his message. Fox criticized Peña Nieto for hosting Trump, warning that it would be seen as a betrayal and hurt his approval ratings. Fox accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his sinking poll numbers and described the move as "opportunistic" and "desperate." Fox also recalled his previous invitation to Trump to visit Mexico and apologize to the Mexican people, which Trump misrepresented in a tweet. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, with potential consequences for their respective candidacies.

END OF SUMMARY.
