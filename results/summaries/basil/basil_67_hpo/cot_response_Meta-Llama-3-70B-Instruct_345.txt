SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is "not welcome to Mexico" and that the Mexican people "reject his message." Fox warned that if Peña Nieto does not stand up to Trump, he will be viewed as a "traitor" and that Trump is using the meeting to "boost his sinking poll numbers." Fox called Trump's actions "opportunistic" and "desperate," and accused him of "cheating" and being a "false prophet." Fox also tweeted that Trump should "show some respect" to Mexico. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, with the potential to hurt their approval ratings. END OF SUMMARY.
