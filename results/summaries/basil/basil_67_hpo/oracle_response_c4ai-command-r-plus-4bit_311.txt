SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized incumbent Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican Donald Trump, who has been fearmongering about Mexico and its people, to meet with him. Fox argued that Trump is using Mexico and Peña Nieto to boost his poll numbers, and that the Mexican president risks being seen as a "traitor" if he does not stand up to Trump's offensive rhetoric. Mitt Romney's trip to Israel during his campaign is cited as a potential risk for Trump, and Fox calls the meeting a "desperate" and "opportunistic move." The article also mentions Fox's previous expletive-laden outburst towards Trump, for which he later apologized and invited Trump to learn about the real Mexico. Fox's stance highlights the moral framing of the issue, including concerns about cheating, lying, and making mistakes that could have negative consequences for both countries.
END OF SUMMARY.
