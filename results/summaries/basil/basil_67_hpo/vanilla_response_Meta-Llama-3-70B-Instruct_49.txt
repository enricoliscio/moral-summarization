SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Trump has been vocal about building a wall on the US-Mexico border and has made negative comments about Mexico and its leaders. Fox warned that Peña Nieto's approval ratings could suffer if he doesn't stand up to Trump, and that hosting Trump could be seen as a "traitorous" act. Fox also accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his sinking poll numbers. Trump tweeted that Fox had previously invited him to Mexico, which Fox denied, saying he had invited Trump to apologize to the Mexican people.
