SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and a "desperate move". Fox accused Trump of "fear-mongering" and "cheating" Mexicans with his anti-Mexico rhetoric, promising to build a wall and claiming Mexico would pay for it. Fox warned Peña Nieto that hosting Trump would be viewed as a "traitorous" act, and that he would be "using" Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers. Fox also accused Trump of "lying" about his invitation, tweeting that he had invited Trump to apologize to Mexicans, not to play politics. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, who is struggling with corruption "scandals" and low approval ratings. Fox urged U.S. citizens to "stop" being fooled by Trump's false promises and to see him for what he is - a "false prophet".
