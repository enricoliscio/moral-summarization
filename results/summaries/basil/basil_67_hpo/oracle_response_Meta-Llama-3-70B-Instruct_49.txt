SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and a "desperate move". Fox accused Trump of "fear-mongering" and "cheating" Mexicans with his anti-immigration rhetoric and promises to build a wall. He warned that if Peña Nieto doesn't stand up to Trump, he'll be viewed as a "traitor" by the Mexican people. Fox also criticized Trump for "using" Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both leaders, with Peña Nieto's approval ratings already at a record low due to corruption "scandals". Fox urged the US public to "stop" believing Trump's lies and to see him for what he is - a "false prophet". The meeting has sparked a heated exchange between Fox and Trump on Twitter, with Fox accusing Trump of "lying" about their previous interactions. END OF SUMMARY.
