SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump has offended Mexico and its people with his rhetoric and that Peña Nieto would be seen as a traitor if he did not stand up to Trump during the meeting. Trump has made controversial statements about Mexico and its people, including his promise to build a wall along the border and his claims that Mexico sends criminals and rapists to the US. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, who is facing low approval ratings. Fox warned that the meeting could be seen as an opportunistic move by Trump to boost his poll numbers and that it could backfire for both men. Fox also referenced his previous criticism of Trump, in which he used an expletive to describe Trump's wall proposal, and denied that he had ever invited Trump to Mexico without conditions.
END OF SUMMARY.
