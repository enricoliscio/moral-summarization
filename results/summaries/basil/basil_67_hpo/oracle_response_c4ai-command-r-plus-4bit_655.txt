SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned current President Enrique Pe単a Nieto for inviting controversial Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet him in Mexico, just before Trump is due to give a speech on immigration in Arizona. Trump has repeatedly fear-mongered about Mexico, railing against "rapists" and drug dealers and insisting that Mexico will pay for a border wall. Mitt Romney's similar trip in 2012 did not go over well, and Pe単a Nieto's own approval rating is already at a record low due to corruption scandals. Fox warns that Pe単a Nieto will be seen as "a traitor" if he does not stand up to Trump during their meeting. He accuses Trump of using Mexico and Pe単a Nieto to boost his poll numbers, calling the meeting a desperate and opportunistic move. Fox previously railed against Trump's offensive remarks about Mexico, and while he later apologized for his own use of an expletive, he continues to stand against Trump's message, calling on him to show respect to Mexico and stop lying.
END OF SUMMARY.
