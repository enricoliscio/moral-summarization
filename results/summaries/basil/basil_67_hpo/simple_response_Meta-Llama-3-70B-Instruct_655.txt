SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly condemned current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that the Mexican people reject his message. He warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he does not stand up to Trump, who has spent over a year insulting Mexico and its leaders. Fox accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his sinking poll numbers and Peña Nieto of taking a huge political risk by hosting him. He described Trump's actions as "opportunistic" and "desperate" and urged US citizens to see through Trump's false promises. Fox's criticism comes after Trump's repeated attacks on Mexico, including his promise to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and his fear-mongering about "rapists" and drug dealers.
