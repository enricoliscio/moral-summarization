SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Pe単a Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump's message and behavior towards Mexico, including his promise to build a wall along the border, were offensive to Mexicans and that Pe単a Nieto risked being seen as a traitor if he did not stand up to Trump during the meeting. Mitt Romney's trip to Israel during the 2012 presidential campaign was mentioned as a potential risk for Trump's candidacy. Pe単a Nieto's own approval rating has been low due to corruption scandals, and the meeting could be seen as an attempt to boost his image. Fox also warned that Trump was using the meeting opportunistically to boost his poll numbers and that it would not be well-received by the American public. He emphasized that Mexico rejects Trump's message and that the meeting was a mistake on Pe単a Nieto's part.
END OF SUMMARY.
