Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet him. Fox says Trump isn't welcome and that most Mexicans dislike him because of his negative comments about Mexico. Trump has been criticizing Mexico, promising a wall and making fearmongering statements about immigrants.

Fox also mentions that Peña Nieto is taking a political risk by meeting Trump, which could make him look like a traitor. He thinks Trump is using the meeting to boost his polls, which are sinking. Fox is upset because he feels Mexico is being used, and he wants Peña Nieto to stand up against Trump.

Earlier, Fox had a heated exchange with Trump, using strong language, but later apologized and invited Trump to Mexico. Trump pointed this out in a tweet, but Fox responded by saying he invited Trump to apologize, not to meet him.

So, the moral framing here is about loyalty and respect towards Mexico. Fox is upset because Peña Nieto is meeting Trump, who has been disrespectful. Fox sees this as Mexico being used by Trump for political gain, which is a betrayal. The key points are Fox's criticism, the political risk for Peña Nieto, Trump's negative image, and the underlying moral stance against Trump's treatment of Mexico.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without going over 200 words. I should include Fox's criticism, the reason behind it (Trump's negative rhetoric), the political risk, and the moral aspect of Mexico being disrespected. Also, mention the context of Fox's past interactions with Trump.

Let me structure this:

1. Fox criticizes Peña Nieto for inviting Trump.
2. Fox says Trump is disliked in Mexico due to his negative comments.
3. Fox warns Peña Nieto about the political risk, calling him a traitor if he doesn't stand up.
4. Fox sees Trump using Mexico to boost his polls.
5. Fox's moral stance against Trump's disrespectful actions.
6. Mention Fox's past exchange with Trump and the current context.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main points and the moral framing. Make sure to include the key elements without getting too detailed.
