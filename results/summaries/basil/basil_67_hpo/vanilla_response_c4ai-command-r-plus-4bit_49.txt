SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet in Mexico. Fox argued that Trump's visit is opportunistic and that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a traitor if he does not stand up to Trump's offensive messages about Mexico. Fox warned that Trump is using the meeting to boost his poll numbers and that it is a desperate move that will not work. He also referenced his previous expletive-laden outburst against Trump, stating that Mexico will not pay for a border wall. Trump noted Fox's invitation to visit Mexico, while Fox countered that it was an invitation to apologize to Mexicans.
