SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned the meeting between current Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, calling it a "desperate" and "opportunistic move." Fox accused Trump of fearmongering about Mexicans, claiming that he is "cheating everybody" and "using Mexico" to boost his poll numbers. He warned that Peña Nieto risks being seen as a "traitor" if he does not stand up to Trump and his controversial messages. The meeting, which has sparked outrage in Mexico, comes amid corruption scandals affecting Peña Nieto's administration and Trump's relentless attacks on Mexico, including his promise to build a wall along the border and make Mexico pay for it. Fox, who previously used an expletive to reject Trump's wall proposal, called on Trump to "show some respect" to Mexico and its people. He emphasized that Mexico is not a country to be played with and that Trump's visit is a mistake that could have significant repercussions for both leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
