SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox harshly criticized current President Enrique Pe単a Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, calling Trump a "false prophet" who is "cheating everybody." Fox warned that Pe単a Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump, who has spent over a year "fear-mongering" about Mexico and its leaders. Fox accused Trump of using the meeting to "boost his sinking poll numbers" and Pe単a Nieto of taking an "enormous political risk" by hosting him. Fox also called Trump's move "opportunistic" and "desperate." The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Pe単a Nieto, with Fox urging the Mexican people to reject Trump's message and show "respect" to their country. END OF SUMMARY.
