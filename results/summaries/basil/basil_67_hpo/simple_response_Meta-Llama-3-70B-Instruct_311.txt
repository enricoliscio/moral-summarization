SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that the Mexican people reject his message. Fox accused Trump of using Mexico to boost his poll numbers and warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump. Fox also called Trump's move "opportunistic" and "desperate," and expressed hope that US citizens would see through Trump's false promises. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, with potential negative consequences for their respective candidacies. Fox's criticism is rooted in Trump's previous comments about Mexico and its people, including his promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and his characterization of Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and drug dealers.
