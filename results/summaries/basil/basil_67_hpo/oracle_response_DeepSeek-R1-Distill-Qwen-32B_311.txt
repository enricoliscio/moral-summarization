Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure I include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about Vicente Fox criticizing Enrique Peña Nieto for meeting Trump. Fox is upset because Trump has been negative towards Mexico, using fearmongering and promising a wall. Fox calls Trump's actions opportunistic and warns that Peña Nieto is taking a political risk, which could be seen as a mistake. He also accuses Trump of cheating and lying.

I should structure the summary to highlight Fox's criticism, the context of Trump's negative rhetoric, the political risks, and Fox's accusations. I need to use words like fearmongering, using, mistake, cheating, lying, and maybe others from the list.

I'll start by stating Fox's criticism, mention Trump's invitation, then Fox's disapproval and the reasons. I'll include the moral terms as I go, ensuring the summary flows naturally and stays under 200 words.

I should also make sure to mention that Peña Nieto's meeting with Trump is a political risk and that Fox views it as a mistake. Adding that Fox thinks Trump is using Mexico to boost his polls ties in the 'using' term. Finally, I'll note Fox's accusations of cheating and lying to wrap up the moral framing.

Let me draft this, keeping it concise and ensuring all key points and moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly condemned current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet in Mexico, just before Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona. Fox criticized Trump’s fearmongering and anti-Mexico rhetoric, stating, “He is not welcome to Mexico” and that 130 million Mexicans reject Trump’s message. Trump, who has spent over a year attacking Mexico and its leaders, accepted Peña Nieto’s invitation, while Hillary Clinton declined. Fox warned Peña Nieto that hosting Trump would be seen as a mistake and could damage his political standing, accusing Trump of using Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers. Fox called Trump’s actions “opportunistic” and “desperate,” urging U.S. citizens to see Trump’s true nature. Earlier, Fox apologized for a fiery outburst against Trump, but Trump responded by mocking Fox’s invitation to visit Mexico. Fox accused Trump of lying and demanded respect, emphasizing that Mexico should not be “played with.” END OF SUMMARY.
