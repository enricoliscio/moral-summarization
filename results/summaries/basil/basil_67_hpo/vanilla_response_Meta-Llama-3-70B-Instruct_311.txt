SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Trump has been critical of Mexico and its leaders, promising to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and making negative comments about Mexican immigrants. Fox warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump, and that the meeting is a political risk for the Mexican president. Fox also accused Trump of using the meeting to boost his sinking poll numbers. The meeting is seen as a surprise move, and some view it as a risky move for Trump's candidacy.
