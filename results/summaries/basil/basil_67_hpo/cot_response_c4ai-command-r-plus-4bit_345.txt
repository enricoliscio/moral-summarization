SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico. Fox rejected Trump's visit, stating that Mexicans do not welcome or like him due to his offensive rhetoric towards their country. Trump has repeatedly attacked Mexico and its leaders, promising to build a wall along the border and spreading fear about immigrants. Fox warned Peña Nieto that he risks being seen as a traitor if he does not stand up to Trump during their meeting. He accused Trump of using the visit opportunistically to boost his poll numbers by appearing soft on his previous anti-Mexico stance. Fox also highlighted the potential damage to Peña Nieto's reputation, stating that he should demand respect and not allow himself to be offended. The meeting holds risks for both leaders, as Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, declined a similar invitation. Fox previously railed against Trump's offensive language and later invited him to learn about Mexico, which Trump misrepresented in a tweet. Fox called him out for lying, demanding respect for Mexico.
