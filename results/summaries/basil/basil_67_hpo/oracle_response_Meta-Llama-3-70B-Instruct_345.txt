SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico, calling it a "big mistake" and a "desperate move". Fox accused Trump of "fear-mongering" and "cheating" Mexicans with his rhetoric about building a wall and labeling immigrants as "rapists" and drug dealers. Fox warned that if Peña Nieto doesn't stand up to Trump, he'll be viewed as a "traitor" by the Mexican people. Fox also accused Trump of "using" Mexico to boost his sinking poll numbers. The meeting is seen as a risky move for both Trump and Peña Nieto, who is struggling with low approval ratings amid corruption "scandals". Fox urged Trump to "stop lying" and show respect for Mexico, saying it's not a playground for him to manipulate. The meeting has sparked controversy, with many Mexicans rejecting Trump's message and viewing his visit as an insult.
