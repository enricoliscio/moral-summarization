Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Donald Trump to meet in Mexico. Fox is really against this meeting, saying Trump isn't welcome and that 130 million Mexicans don't like him. Trump has been criticizing Mexico a lot, talking about building a wall and making negative remarks about Mexicans. 

The article mentions that this meeting is Trump's first with a foreign leader as a nominee, which is risky for him. There's also a reference to Mitt Romney's similar situation, which didn't go well. Peña Nieto's approval ratings are low because of corruption scandals, so he might be trying to improve his image. Fox warns that if Peña Nieto doesn't stand up to Trump, he'll be seen as a traitor. He thinks Trump is using Mexico to boost his polls and that Peña Nieto is taking a big risk. 

Earlier, Fox had a heated exchange with Trump, calling him names and promising Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall. He later apologized and invited Trump to Mexico. Trump pointed this out on Twitter, and Fox responded, saying he invited Trump to apologize to Mexicans and to show respect. 

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: Fox's criticism, the context of Trump's negative comments towards Mexico, the political risks for both Trump and Peña Nieto, and the back-and-forth between Fox and Trump regarding their interactions. I should make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.
