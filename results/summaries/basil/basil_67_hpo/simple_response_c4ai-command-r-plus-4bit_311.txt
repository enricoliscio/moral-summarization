SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, calling the meeting a "desperate" and "opportunistic" move that risks betraying the Mexican people. Fox argued that Trump has repeatedly offended Mexico and its citizens with his inflammatory rhetoric and that Peña Nieto must stand up to him during their meeting. Trump's visit to Mexico, his first meeting with a foreign leader as a presidential nominee, has sparked controversy due to his divisive statements about Mexico and his promise to build a wall along the border. Peña Nieto's own approval ratings have suffered due to corruption scandals, and his decision to host Trump has been seen as a risky attempt to bolster his image. Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's divisive rhetoric and his defense of Mexico's interests have garnered attention, with Fox urging Mexicans to reject Trump's message and stand up for their country's dignity.
END OF SUMMARY.
