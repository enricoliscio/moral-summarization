SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly criticized current President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him in Mexico. Fox stated that Trump is not welcome in Mexico and that 130 million people reject his message. Trump has been critical of Mexico and its leaders, promising to build a wall on the border and making negative comments about Mexican immigrants. Fox warned that Peña Nieto would be viewed as a "traitor" if he doesn't stand up to Trump, and that the meeting is a "desperate move" to boost Trump's sinking poll numbers. Fox had previously criticized Trump, using an expletive to say that Mexico would never pay for a wall, and later apologized and invited Trump to learn about the "real Mexico". Trump tweeted about the invitation, prompting Fox to respond and accuse Trump of lying.
