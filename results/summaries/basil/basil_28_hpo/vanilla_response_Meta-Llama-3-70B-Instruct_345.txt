SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the vice presidential debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, taking an aggressive stance and interrupting Ryan repeatedly. Biden's performance was seen as a rallying cry for the Democratic base, which was disappointed by President Barack Obama's debate performance last week. Instant surveys showed mixed results, but Biden's goal was to push back against Ryan's claims and defend the Obama administration's policies. Ryan, on the other hand, focused on winning over moderate and independent voters. The debate covered domestic and foreign policy issues, with Biden repeatedly challenging Ryan's answers. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as condescending and immature, while Democrats praised his passion and defense of the middle class.

END OF SUMMARY.
