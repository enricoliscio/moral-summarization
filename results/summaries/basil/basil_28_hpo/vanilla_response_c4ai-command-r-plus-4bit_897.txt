SUMMARY: In the only vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed on domestic and foreign policy issues, with Biden taking an aggressive and interruptive approach. Biden aimed to rally the Democratic base after Obama's weak debate performance, and his passion was praised by Obama and his campaign team. Biden focused on pushing back against Republican claims and appealing to the middle class, while Ryan sought to appeal to independent voters. Biden raised Romney's controversial comments about government benefits and criticized Ryan's Medicare plan. The debate was characterized by Biden's demonstrative behavior and his attempts to plow over Ryan with broadsides, while Ryan remained composed and focused on facts and data. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as condescending and over-the-top, while Democrats highlighted his passion and defense of the middle class. The impact of the debate on undecided voters is uncertain, but Biden's performance likely boosted Democratic morale.
