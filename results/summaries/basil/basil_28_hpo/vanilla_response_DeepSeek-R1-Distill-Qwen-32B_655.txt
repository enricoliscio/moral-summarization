Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Biden's performance in the vice presidential debate. The user wants the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Biden dominating the debate against Paul Ryan, using interruptions and aggressive tactics. The surveys showed mixed results, but Biden's main goal was to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor debate performance. 

I should note that Biden interrupted Ryan a lot, which some found effective, while others criticized it as condescending. The focus was on the middle class, and Biden attacked Romney's policies, especially Medicare. The Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, but the Obama campaign focused on the substance of his arguments.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, capturing Biden's aggressive approach, its impact on the Democratic base, the mixed reactions, and the key issues discussed like Medicare and the middle class.

I'll structure the summary to include Biden's performance, the mixed results, the rally for the base, the attacks on Romney, and the Republican reactions. Keeping it under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but comprehensive.

Let me start drafting: Biden dominated the debate, interrupted Ryan, aimed to rally Democrats after Obama's weak performance. Surveys were mixed, but Biden's goal was achieved. He attacked Romney's policies, especially Medicare, while Ryan focused on substance. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, but Democrats focused on his passion for the middle class. The debate covered domestic and foreign policies, with Biden pushing back hard.

Wait, I need to make sure I include that Biden's tactics were seen as over-the-top by some, but effective by others. Also, mention that Biden brought up Romney's fundraiser comments and the $6,400 Medicare claim.

Putting it all together, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200.
