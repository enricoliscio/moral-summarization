SUMMARY: Joe Biden did everything Barack Obama did not do in the first presidential debate. Biden dominated the spotlight, aggressively challenging his opponent, Republican Paul Ryan, and rallying the Democratic base. Biden's performance was over-the-top and likely appealed to worried Democrats, although it may have come across as insufferable to some. Biden focused on pushing back against Republican talking points and appealing to working-class and blue-collar voters, attempting to reclaim the mantle of the party that cares about the middle class. Biden's behavior, including interruptions and audible reactions, was criticized by Republicans as condescending and immature, while Democrats praised his passion and concern for the middle class. The debate also covered foreign policy and substantive policy differences, with Biden taking an aggressive stance on pushing back against Republican claims and appealing to voters' emotions rather than facts. Biden raised the issue of Romney's disparaging comments about government benefit recipients and challenged Ryan to show policies that demonstrate their care for people. Overall, Biden's performance was seen as a win for Democrats and a successful pushback against Republican gains from the first presidential debate.
