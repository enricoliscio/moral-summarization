Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words as per the instructions. Let me read through the article again to spot words that carry moral connotations.

Looking through the text, I see words like "over-the-top," "passion," "concern," "condescending," "smirking," "mocking," "immature," "unhinged," "frustration," "laughing," "facial tics," "losing," "disparagingly," "personal responsibility," "care for their lives," "humanizing," "out of touch," "uncaring," "suspicious," "added," "cost," "more." These words carry moral judgments or evaluations.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should highlight Biden's performance, the reactions from both parties, and the impact on the campaign.

I'll start by noting Biden's aggressive tactics, then mention the mixed reactions from surveys and the campaign's goals. I'll include the Republicans' criticism of his behavior and the Democrats' focus on substance. Finally, I'll touch on the key issues debated and the overall effect on the campaign dynamics.

Let me structure this concisely, ensuring all key points are covered while maintaining the moral framing. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

### SUMMARY:
Joe Biden's vice presidential debate performance was marked by an aggressive, over-the-top style, aimed at rallying the Democratic base after President Obama's weak debate performance. Biden interrupted Ryan repeatedly, displaying passion and concern for the middle class, but Republicans criticized his condescending, smirking, and mocking behavior as immature and unhinged. While Biden's antics frustrated Ryan and drew criticism for being insufferable, Democrats focused on the substance of his arguments, emphasizing Biden's concern for working-class voters. Republicans, however, accused Biden of losing the debate, with Romney's team dismissing his behavior as immaturity. The debate also highlighted Romney's policies, with Biden questioning Ryan's Medicare plan and raising concerns about its impact on seniors. Overall, Biden's performance aimed to counter Romney's focus on the middle class, but it polarized reactions, with Democrats celebrating his passion and Republicans dismissing his behavior as unprofessional. END OF SUMMARY.
