SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. Biden's performance was seen as a much-needed boost to the Democratic base after President Obama's lackluster debate performance last week. While Ryan remained composed and got in some well-aimed shots, Biden's aggressive approach was seen as a deliberate attempt to "push back" and rally Democrats. The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden repeatedly interrupting Ryan and accusing him of being dishonest. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, calling him "unhinged" and "immature," but Democrats saw it as a necessary show of passion and concern for the middle class. The debate's outcome is unclear, but Biden's performance is likely to reassure worried Democrats and set the tone for Obama's next debate with Romney.

END OF SUMMARY.
