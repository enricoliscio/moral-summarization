Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. Biden was very active, interrupting Ryan a lot, which some found aggressive but others thought showed passion and concern for the middle class. The author used words like "passion," "concern," "interrupting," "death," "accurate," "mocking," "plow," "create," "bipartisan," and "added."

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. The key points are Biden's aggressive style, his interruptions, the impact on undecided voters, the focus on the middle class, and the critique of Romney's policies. Also, the article mentions the mixed reactions from both parties and the overall strategy to rally the Democratic base.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Biden's performance, his interruptions, the mixed results of the debate, and the focus on the middle class. I'll include the critiques from both sides and the overall impact on the campaign.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, ensuring all the moral words are included naturally. I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY:  
Joe Biden's performance in the vice-presidential debate was marked by passion and concern for the middle class, as he aggressively interrupted Paul Ryan and challenged his answers. Biden's style, which included eye rolls and interjections, was seen as mocking by some, while others viewed it as a way to push back against Romney's focus on the same demographic. The debate, which touched on issues like Medicare, tax policy, and foreign policy, saw Biden plowing over Ryan's points with emotional appeals, while Ryan focused on data and facts. Biden's interruptions and interruptions were a key part of his strategy to rally the Democratic base after Obama's weak debate performance. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as unhinged and insufferable, while Democrats praised his passion and concern. The debate's impact on undecided voters remains unclear, but Biden's performance aimed to create a contrast with Romney's policies and reassure anxious Democrats. The focus on bipartisan issues, like Medicare, highlighted the stakes for the middle class, with Biden warning against plans that could add costs for seniors. END OF SUMMARY.
