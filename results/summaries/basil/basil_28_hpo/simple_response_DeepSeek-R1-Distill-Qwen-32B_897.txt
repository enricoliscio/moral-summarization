Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan debate, focusing on the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article describes Vice President Biden's performance in the debate against Paul Ryan. Biden was very aggressive, interrupting Ryan a lot, rolling his eyes, and making accusations. The author seems to present this as Biden trying to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor performance. 

I notice that the article contrasts Biden's style with Obama's, highlighting that Biden did everything Obama didn't. The moral framing here is about Biden's determination to energize his party after a setback. There's also a mention of how Biden's performance was seen by different groups: Democrats were reassured, while Republicans criticized his behavior as disrespectful.

The author includes quotes from both sides. For example, Republicans like John Thune and Jason Chaffetz criticize Biden's interruptions and demeanor, while Democrats like Andrew Sullivan and Obama's team praise his passion and concern for the middle class. This contrast shows the different moral perspectives on Biden's actions.

The article also touches on policy discussions, especially Medicare and the economy, but the focus is more on Biden's approach and its impact on the campaign dynamics. Biden's strategy seems to be about countering Romney's focus on the middle class, which was a point of weakness for Obama.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements: Biden's aggressive tactics, the reaction from both parties, the contrast with Obama, and the overall impact on the campaign. It should also reflect the moral judgments made by each sideâ€”Democrats seeing it as a positive move, Republicans as unprofessional.

I'll structure the summary to first state Biden's approach, then the reactions, and finally the implications for the campaign. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it's concise but comprehensive.

SUMMARY:  
Vice President Joe Biden dominated the vice presidential debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, adopting an aggressive and passionate approach to rally the Democratic base after President Obama's weak performance in the prior debate. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, rolled his eyes, and accused him of inaccuracies, particularly on Libya and Medicare. While Democrats praised Biden's "passion" and focus on the middle class, Republicans criticized his behavior as condescending and unprofessional. Biden's goal was to counter Mitt Romney's narrative of helping the middle class and to energize Democratic voters. The debate highlighted contrasting styles: Biden's emotional appeal versus Ryan's data-driven arguments. Biden's performance, though polarizing, succeeded in shifting focus away from Romney's campaign and reassured anxious Democrats.  

END OF SUMMARY.
