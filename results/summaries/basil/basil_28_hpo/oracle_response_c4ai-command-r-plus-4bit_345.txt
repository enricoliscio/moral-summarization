SUMMARY: Joe Biden's aggressive and passionate performance in the vice presidential debate sought to push back hard against Republican claims and rally the Democratic base after President Obama's lackluster showing in the first presidential debate. Biden dominated the spotlight, bombarding Paul Ryan with interruptions, accusations, and eye rolls. While Biden's behavior may have been off-putting to some, it achieved its goal of energizing worried Democrats. Biden focused on appealing to working-class and blue-collar voters, challenging Ryan's claims of concern for the middle class and highlighting Romney's disparaging comments about government benefit recipients. The substantive portions of the debate covered Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Medicare, and tax policy. Biden, at times, resorted to broadsides and appeals to voters' emotions rather than data-driven arguments. His approach raised questions about the veracity and practicality of Ryan's policy proposals. Biden's performance, though over-the-top at times, likely accomplished its goal of rallying Democrats and shifting the focus away from Obama's debate performance.
END OF SUMMARY.
