Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan debate. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should follow specific formatting with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The article describes the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan, highlighting Biden's aggressive and energetic performance. He interrupted Ryan a lot, used eye rolls and accusations, which was a contrast to Obama's previous debate performance. 

The article mentions that Biden's goal was to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor performance. There were mixed reactions from surveys, but the debate's impact is usually minimal. Biden's performance was seen as passionate, especially regarding the middle class, which Romney had emphasized. 

On the Republican side, they criticized Biden's behavior as disruptive and unprofessional. The debate covered topics like foreign policy and domestic issues, including Medicare and tax policies. Biden attacked Romney's past comments about government benefits, while Ryan defended Romney's caring nature through a personal story. 

The summary should capture Biden's high-energy approach, its purpose to energize Democrats, the mixed public reaction, and the key issues debated. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and covers all main points without going into too much detail.
