SUMMARY: In the only vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan faced off in a lively and aggressive discussion that covered both domestic and foreign policy issues. Biden took an aggressive approach, frequently interrupting and challenging Ryan, in contrast to President Obama's more subdued performance in the previous week's debate. Biden's performance was intended to rally the Democratic base and push back against Republican claims. He focused on appealing to working-class and blue-collar voters, emphasizing the phrase "middle class." Biden also raised Romney's comments about government benefits, which had been previously disparaged by Romney. Ryan, meanwhile, maintained his composure and aimed to appeal to moderate and independent voters. The debate covered a range of topics, including Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Medicare, and tax policy. Biden challenged Ryan on his policies, while Ryan countered with data-filled arguments. Biden's argument on Medicare appealed to voters' emotions rather than facts. The impact of the debate on undecided voters is uncertain, but Biden's performance likely boosted the Democratic base.
END OF SUMMARY.
