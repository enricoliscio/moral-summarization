SUMMARY: Joe Biden's aggressive and demonstrative performance in the vice presidential debate against Paul Ryan rallied Democrats who had been worried and anxious after President Barack Obama's woeful showing in the first presidential debate. Biden dominated the spotlight, bombarding Ryan with interruptions and accusations, overshadowing the substance of Ryan's remarks with his aggressive behavior. Biden's intent was clear: to push back hard against the Republicans, who had surprised Democrats by depriving them of their edge with working-class and blue-collar voters. The Obama campaign relished in Biden's performance, accusing Ryan of being condescending and intolerant. While Biden may have overshadowed Ryan's composure, Ryan remained focused on winning over moderate and independent voters with a serious and sober performance. The debate fluctuated between domestic and foreign policy issues, with Biden pushing back on issues related to Libya, Syria, Medicare, and tax policy. Biden's performance was characterized as "unhinged" by Republicans, who felt his behavior was insufferable and immature. The impact of Biden's aggressive tactics on undecided voters is hard to tell, but he likely accomplished his goal of bucking up worried Democrats and rallying the base. Biden's offensive overshadowed Ryan's composure, and the Democrats attempted to steal back their edge with working-class voters by appealing to their angst over the Republican's disparaging and out-of-touch portrayal of them.
