SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate with Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. Biden's performance was intended to rally the Democratic base after President Obama's woeful debate performance last week. Obama praised Biden, saying he was "terrific" and showed "passion" and "concern" for the middle class. Republicans, on the other hand, criticized Biden's behavior, calling him "condescending" and "unhinged." Ryan, however, remained composed and focused on winning over moderate and independent voters. The debate fluctuated between domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's claims. Biden's argument on Medicare was aimed at voters' emotions, warning them to be suspicious of Ryan's plan that would "add" $6,400 a year to the cost of Medicare. Overall, Biden's performance was seen as a "solid win" by Democrats, while Republicans thought he came across as "mocking" and "immature."

END OF SUMMARY.
