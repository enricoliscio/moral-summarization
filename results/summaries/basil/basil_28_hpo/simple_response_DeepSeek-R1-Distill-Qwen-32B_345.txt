Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan debate, focusing on the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article starts by contrasting Biden's performance with Obama's previous debate. Biden was very active, interrupting Ryan, rolling his eyes, and being aggressive. This was meant to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor performance. The surveys showed mixed results, but Biden's main goal was to energize his supporters.

The author highlights Biden's behavior as over-the-top, with examples like calling Ryan's statement "malarkey." The article mentions how Biden's interruptions and interruptions were seen by Republicans as condescending and unprofessional, while Democrats saw it as passion and concern for the middle class.

There's a focus on the middle class issue. Romney and Ryan were emphasizing policies that help the middle class, which Obama lacked in his debate. Biden tried to counter this by attacking Romney's policies, especially Medicare, using emotional appeals rather than detailed data.

The article also notes the contrast between Biden's style and Ryan's composure. Ryan was seen as serious and steady, while Biden was more aggressive and emotional. The outcome was mixed, with both sides claiming victory based on their perspectives.

The moral framing seems to be about the effectiveness of Biden's approach. Was his aggressive style the right way to appeal to voters, or was it seen as unprofessional? The article suggests that while it energized Democrats, it also drew criticism from Republicans, highlighting a clash in communication styles.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, emphasizing the moral aspects of Biden's approach and its impact on the campaign dynamics.
