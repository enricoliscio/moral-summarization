Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, highlighting Biden's aggressive and passionate performance. 

I notice that the article contrasts Biden's approach with Obama's previous performance, mentioning how Biden's actions were meant to rally the Democratic base. The moral framing here seems to be about Biden's strategy to counter Romney's focus on the middle class and to energize his supporters.

I should identify key elements: Biden's interruptions, his emotional appeals, the mixed reactions from surveys, and the impact on undecided voters. Also, the article discusses how Biden's behavior was seen differently by Democrats and Republicans, with the former viewing it as passionate and the latter as disruptive.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Biden's actions, the contrast with Obama, the mixed survey results, and the differing reactions from both parties. I should ensure the moral aspects are clear, such as Biden's intent to rally the base and the criticism from Republicans about his behavior.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to highlight the strategic and emotional elements of the debate.

SUMMARY:  
Joe Biden dominated the vice presidential debate against Paul Ryan, adopting a passionate and assertive tone to rally the Democratic base after President Obama's underwhelming performance in the prior debate. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, rolled his eyes, and accused him of inaccuracies, a stark contrast to Romney's focus on the middle class. While surveys showed mixed results, Biden's goal seemed to be energizing Democrats rather than swaying undecided voters. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as disruptive and unprofessional, while Democrats praised his passion and concern for working-class voters. The debate also highlighted Biden's emotional appeal, as he criticized Romney's policies and raised concerns about Medicare costs. Despite Ryan's composure and factual arguments, Biden's high-energy performance aimed to counter Romney's narrative and set the stage for Obama's next debate. END OF SUMMARY.
