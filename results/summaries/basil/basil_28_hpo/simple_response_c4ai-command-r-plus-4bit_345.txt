SUMMARY: Joe Biden's aggressive performance in his debate with Paul Ryan aimed to rally the Democratic base and push back against Republican claims. Biden interrupted Ryan repeatedly and accused him of being insincere in his professed concern for the middle class. While Biden's behavior may have been over-the-top, it likely achieved his goal of energizing worried Democrats. Obama himself praised Biden's "passion" and "great concern for the middle class." Biden's main objective was to challenge Ryan's assertions and expose Romney's policies as detrimental to the middle class. Biden's approach was more emotional than data-driven, appealing to voters' gut feelings rather than their minds. He sought to discredit Romney's Medicare plan as burdensome for seniors, despite acknowledging inaccuracies in the Obama campaign's advertising on this issue. Biden's performance stood in stark contrast to Obama's passive approach in his own debate with Romney. Biden's strategy may have been successful in shifting the focus away from Obama's previous debate performance and towards the substance of the Democratic ticket's policies and genuine concern for the middle class.
END OF SUMMARY.
