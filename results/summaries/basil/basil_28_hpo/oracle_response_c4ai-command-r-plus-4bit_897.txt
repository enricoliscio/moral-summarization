SUMMARY: Joe Biden took center stage in the vice presidential debate, bombarding Paul Ryan with interruptions, accusations, and eye-rolls. Biden's aggressive performance aimed to rally the Democratic base after Obama's lackluster debate showing. While Biden's behavior was criticized by Republicans as "condescending" and "immature," Democrats praised his passion and concern for the middle class. Biden pushed back hard on foreign policy and Medicare, often plowing over Ryan with broadsides. He raised Romney's controversial comments about government benefits recipients and challenged Ryan to show policies that demonstrate their care for people. Biden's argument on Medicare appealed to voters' emotions rather than facts. Overall, Biden's performance likely boosted Democratic morale and set the tone for Obama's upcoming debate with Romney.
END OF SUMMARY.
