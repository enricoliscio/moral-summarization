Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan debate. Let me read through it first to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that Biden did a lot more than Obama did in his debate, and he dominated the spotlight. He interrupted Ryan a lot, rolled his eyes, and accused him, which was intense. The surveys after the debate showed mixed results, but vice presidential debates usually don't have a big impact. Biden's performance probably helped rally the Democratic base after Obama's bad debate.

Obama himself praised Biden, calling him terrific. Biden was very energetic, interrupting Ryan, which made some people think he was over-the-top. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, calling him condescending and immature. Democrats, on the other hand, were happy because Biden pushed back against Romney's focus on the middle class.

The debate covered domestic and foreign policies. Biden was aggressive, challenging Ryan on Romney's controversial comments about government benefits. Ryan tried to counter with a story about Romney's compassion and questioned the accuracy of Biden's claims. The debate also touched on Medicare and tax policies, with Biden focusing on emotional appeals rather than detailed numbers.

Overall, Biden's performance was polarizing. Democrats saw it as passionate and effective, while Republicans saw it as disruptive. The debate's impact on undecided voters is unclear, but it definitely energized the Democratic base.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers the key points: Biden's aggressive style, the mixed reactions, the topics discussed, and the impact on the campaign.
