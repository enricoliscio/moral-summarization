SUMMARY:
In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden dominated the spotlight, charging at Paul Ryan with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. Biden's performance was morally framed as "passionate" and "terrific," with Obama praising him for showing "passion" and "great concern for the middle class." In contrast, Republicans described Biden's behavior as "condescending," "unhinged," and "immature." Ryan, on the other hand, was seen as "competent," "serious," and "sober." The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's claims. The Obama campaign relished in Republicans' focus on Biden's behavior, arguing that they had "lost the debate." Overall, Biden's performance was seen as a "solid win" that rallied the Democratic base after Obama's "woeful" debate performance last week. END OF SUMMARY.
