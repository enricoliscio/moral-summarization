SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the only debate with Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at the Republican nominee with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. While the impact on undecided voters is unclear, Biden's performance likely rallied the Democratic base after President Barack Obama's lackluster debate performance last week. Biden's aggressive style, which included interrupting Ryan repeatedly, drew mixed reactions from both sides. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as condescending and immature, while Democrats praised his passion and concern for the middle class. The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's claims. The Obama campaign was pleased with the focus on Biden's behavior, arguing that it distracted from the substance of his remarks. Overall, Biden's performance set the tone for Obama's next debate with Romney, with a focus on pushing back against Republican claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
