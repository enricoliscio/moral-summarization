SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at him from the start and bombarding him with accusations. Biden's performance was seen as a rallying cry for the Democratic base, which was disappointed by President Barack Obama's debate performance last week. While Biden's behavior was seen as condescending and interruptive by Republicans, Democrats praised his passion and concern for the middle class. The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's answers. Biden's goal was to show that he and Obama care about the middle class, and he repeatedly attacked Ryan's policies as harmful to this demographic. Republicans, on the other hand, saw Biden's behavior as unhinged and immature, and focused on his mannerisms rather than the substance of his remarks.

END OF SUMMARY.
