SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, showcasing his passion and concern for the middle class. Biden's performance was a stark contrast to President Barack Obama's lackluster debate last week, and it seemed to rally the Democratic base. Biden's aggressive approach, which included interrupting Ryan repeatedly, was seen as condescending by some Republicans. However, Democrats argued that Biden showed a great concern for the middle class, which was lacking in Obama's debate. The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's claims. Biden's argument on Medicare was aimed at voters' guts, warning them about the potential added cost of $6,400 a year under Romney's plan. Republicans, on the other hand, thought Biden's behavior was unhinged and immature. Overall, the debate was a solid win for Biden, who showed he was willing to plow ahead and create a stir.

END OF SUMMARY.
