SUMMARY:
The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was marked by Biden's aggressive and over-the-top performance, which aimed to rally and buck up worried Democrats after President Obama's woeful first debate performance. Biden's passionate and sometimes insufferable demeanor was cheered by Democrats as a solid win, while Republicans labeled him as condescending, immature, and unhinged. Biden focused on pushing back hard against Ryan's arguments and rallying the Democratic base by appealing to working class and blue-collar voters. He interrupted Ryan repeatedly, rolled his eyes, and accused him of being inaccurate. Biden's performance was designed to steal back the edge Romney gained with his appeal to the middle class in the previous debate. The Obama campaign relished in Biden's passion and digs at Ryan, while Republicans criticized his behavior as intolerated and immature. Overall, Biden's outsized and demonstrative performance dominated the spotlight and accomplished the goal of rallying anxious Democrats.
