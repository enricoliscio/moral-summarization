SUMMARY: In the only vice presidential debate of the 2012 election, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed on a range of domestic and foreign policy issues. Biden took an aggressive approach, frequently interrupting and challenging Ryan, in contrast to President Obama's passive performance in the first presidential debate. Biden's goal was to rally the Democratic base and push back against Republican claims. The debate covered topics such as the Benghazi attack, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Medicare, and tax policy. Biden emphasized his concern for the middle class and attempted to appeal to working-class and blue-collar voters. Ryan, meanwhile, focused on winning over moderate and independent voters with a more composed and measured approach. While Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as condescending and over-the-top, Democrats praised his passion and substance. The impact of the debate on undecided voters remains unclear, but Biden's performance likely boosted the morale of anxious Democrats. The debate also highlighted differences in Medicare plans and Romney's controversial comments on government dependency. Biden questioned Ryan's commitment to helping people, while Ryan defended Romney's character. Overall, the debate showcased the contrasting styles and priorities of the two candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
