Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan debate. Let me read through it first.

The article starts by saying that Joe Biden dominated the debate, doing a lot more than Obama did in his previous debate. He interrupted Ryan a lot, rolled his eyes, and made accusations. The impact on undecided voters is unclear, but Biden's performance was meant to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor debate.

Obama himself praised Biden, calling him terrific. Biden was very active, interrupting Ryan, which some found over-the-top. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, calling him condescending and insufferable. However, Democrats saw him as passionate and concerned for the middle class.

The debate touched on foreign policy and domestic issues, with Biden pushing back hard, especially on Romney's comments about government benefits. Ryan tried to defend Romney with a story, but Biden focused on emotional arguments about Medicare costs.

In the end, the article says Biden's performance was more about energizing Democrats than changing many minds, setting the stage for Obama's next debate.

Now, I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll focus on the key points: Biden's aggressive approach, the mixed impact on voters, the reactions from both parties, and the focus on the middle class and Medicare.

I should make sure to include that Biden's performance was meant to rally Democrats after Obama's weak debate, the mixed results from surveys, and the contrasting views on his behavior. Also, the mention of Romney's comments and Biden's emotional appeal on Medicare are important.

I'll structure the summary to start with Biden's performance, mention the reactions, the debate topics, and conclude with the overall impact on the campaign.
