SUMMARY:
Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, showcasing "passion" and a "great concern for the middle class." His performance was deemed "terrific" by President Obama, who was "cheered" by the offensive. Biden's aggressive approach was seen as a deliberate attempt to "push back" and "rally the Democratic base" after Obama's "woeful" debate performance last week. While Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as "condescending," "unhinged," and "immature," Democrats focused on the substance of his remarks, highlighting his "solid win" and Ryan's "competent" but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to defend Romney's policies. The debate's outcome will take days to sort out, but Biden's performance has likely reassured worried Democrats and shifted the focus back to the middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
