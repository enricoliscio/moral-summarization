SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the only debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at the Republican nominee with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. Biden's performance was intended to rally the Democratic base after President Barack Obama's poor debate performance last week. Two instant surveys showed mixed results, but Biden's aggressive approach likely accomplished what he intended. Obama praised Biden's performance, saying he was "terrific tonight." Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, calling him "unhinged" and "immature." The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's answers. The vice president also raised the issue of Romney's comments about people who receive government benefits. While Ryan was knowledgeable and in command of the facts, Biden attempted to overwhelm him with broadsides. The debate's impact on undecided voters remains to be seen.

END OF SUMMARY.
