Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan debate, focusing on the moral framing. The article describes Biden's performance as aggressive and passionate, which was intended to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor debate. I should highlight how Biden's tactics contrasted with Romney's approach and the impact on undecided voters. I also need to mention the mixed reactions from both parties and the overall strategy to appeal to the middle class. Keeping it under 200 words and preserving the moral aspects is key.

SUMMARY: Vice President Joe Biden delivered a spirited and sometimes over-the-top performance in his debate against Republican nominee Paul Ryan, aiming to rally the Democratic base after President Barack Obama's underwhelming debate. Biden aggressively interrupted Ryan, rolled his eyes, and accused him of inaccuracies, particularly calling Ryan's statements about the Benghazi attack "a bunch of malarkey." While Biden's passionate defense of the middle class and criticism of Romney's policies resonated with Democrats, Republicans criticized his behavior as condescending and unprofessional. The debate, dominated by Biden's assertiveness, saw mixed reactions from undecided voters, but its impact on the overall race remains uncertain. Biden's performance was seen as an effort to counter Romney's focus on the middle class and regain momentum for the Obama campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
