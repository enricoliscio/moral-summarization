SUMMARY:
Vice President Joe Biden's aggressive and sometimes over-the-top performance in the vice presidential debate against Republican nominee Rep. Paul Ryan rallied worried Democrats after President Barack Obama's woeful showing in the first presidential debate. Biden dominated the spotlight, bombarding Ryan with interruptions, interjections, eye rolls, and accusations. While instant surveys showed mixed results, Biden's offensive performance likely cheered and reassured anxious Democrats, with Obama himself praising his vice president's "passion" and "great concern for the middle class." Biden's demonstrative behavior, however, drew criticism from Republicans, who described him as condescending, insufferable, and unhinged. Biden pushed back hard against Ryan on foreign policy, Libya, Medicare, and tax policy, and raised the issue of Mitt Romney's disparaging comments about government benefit recipients. Biden's approach focused on voters' guts rather than numbers, and he aimed to showcase Romney and Ryan's lack of caring policies for the middle class.
END OF SUMMARY.
