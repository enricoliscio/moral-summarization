Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points and the tone regarding the performance and its impact on the campaign.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It seems that Biden was very aggressive in the debate, interrupting Ryan a lot, using eye rolls and accusations. The author mentions that this was a response to Obama's poor performance in the previous debate. Biden's goal was to rally the Democratic base, which he did, according to the president. The article also talks about the mixed reactions from surveys and how the debate might have helped Biden in terms of energizing the base but perhaps didn't sway undecided voters much.

The Republicans, on the other hand, criticized Biden's behavior as condescending and unprofessional. They focused on his interruptions and lack of composure. The article also mentions that Biden brought up Romney's controversial comments about government benefits, which was a strategic move to counter Romney's image.

I should highlight the contrast between Biden's passionate, sometimes over-the-top performance and Ryan's more composed approach. The moral framing here seems to be about whether Biden's tactics were effective in energizing the base versus whether they were seen as unprofessional or distracting.

I also need to include the impact on the campaign, like how Obama praised Biden and how the Democrats saw this as a way to regain their edge on appealing to the middle class. The Republicans, however, tried to shift focus away from policy by criticizing Biden's behavior.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points: Biden's aggressive tactics, the goal of rallying the Democratic base, mixed public reaction, Republican criticism, and the strategic focus on policy versus behavior. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral perspective presented in the article.
