SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate with Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. Biden's passionate and concerned performance aimed to rally the Democratic base after President Obama's lackluster debate last week. While Biden's behavior was seen as condescending by Republicans, Democrats hailed it as a much-needed display of passion and concern for the middle class. Biden repeatedly interrupted Ryan, refusing to let him finish his thoughts, and at times, made it difficult for Ryan to get out his answers. The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back hard against Ryan's claims, labeling some as "a bunch of malarkey." Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, calling him "unhinged" and "immature," while Democrats saw it as a necessary response to Ryan's attempts to defend Romney's policies. In the end, Biden's performance was seen as a win for Democrats, who were reinvigorated by his passion and concern for the middle class.

END OF SUMMARY.
