Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible: passion, concern, interrupting, death, accurate, mocking, plow, create, bipartisan, added.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. Biden was aggressive, interrupting Ryan, and tried to rally the Democratic base after Obama's poor performance. The article mentions Biden's passionate and concerned approach, his interrupting, and the impact on undecided voters. It also talks about the topics discussed, like Medicare, and the reactions from both parties.

Now, I need to identify where the morally framed words fit into the summary. I should make sure to include these words naturally without forcing them. For example, Biden's passion and concern for the middle class are key points. His interrupting Ryan is another moral point. The death of the U.S. ambassador in Libya is mentioned, so I can include that. The accuracy of Ryan's statements is questioned, so 'accurate' fits. Biden's mocking of Ryan's policies can be included. The article mentions Biden trying to plow through Ryan's arguments, so 'plow' is relevant. The bipartisan nature of Ryan's Medicare plan is discussed, and Biden points out the added costs, so 'added' fits.

I'll structure the summary to cover the main events: Biden's aggressive performance, his interruption of Ryan, the topics discussed, the reactions from both sides, and the impact on the campaign. I'll ensure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and within 200 words. I'll start by stating Biden's aggressive approach, mention the interrupting, passion, and concern. Then, touch on the topics like Libya, Medicare, and the economic policies. Include the reactions, like Republicans calling him mocking and Democrats praising his passion. Finally, note the bipartisan aspect and the added costs in Medicare.

I need to check that all the specified words are included and that the summary flows naturally. I'll make sure each sentence contributes to the overall picture without unnecessary details. The summary should reflect the moral framing by highlighting the aggressive tactics, the concern for the middle class, and the contrasting reactions from both parties.

After drafting, I'll review the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll also verify that each morally framed word is present and appropriately placed. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Joe Biden's aggressive performance in the vice presidential debate aimed to rally the Democratic base after President Obama's poor debate showing. Biden interrupted Rep. Paul Ryan frequently, displaying passion and concern for the middle class, while accusing Ryan of inaccurate statements. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior as mocking and insufferable, while Democrats praised his fiery approach. The debate touched on issues like Libya, Medicare, and economic policies, with Biden challenging Ryan's claims and highlighting the added costs of Romney's Medicare plan. Biden's performance, though disruptive, was seen as an attempt to create a contrast with Romney's focus on the middle class. The debate also revealed bipartisan divisions, with Ryan emphasizing Romney's policies while Biden focused on emotional appeals. Biden's tactics, including interrupting and mocking, were designed to push back against Romney's narrative and energize Democratic voters. END OF SUMMARY.
