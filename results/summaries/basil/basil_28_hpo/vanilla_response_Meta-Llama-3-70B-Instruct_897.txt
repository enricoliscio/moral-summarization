SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, charging at him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections, and accusations. While Biden's performance may have rallied the Democratic base, its impact on undecided voters is unclear. Two instant surveys showed mixed results. Biden's aggressive approach was a stark contrast to President Obama's debate performance last week, which was criticized for being too passive. Republicans criticized Biden for being condescending and interrupting Ryan, while Democrats praised his passion and concern for the middle class. The debate focused on domestic and foreign policy, with Biden pushing back against Ryan's answers and attempting to appeal to working-class and blue-collar voters. The Obama campaign was pleased with the outcome, saying Republicans were focused on Biden's behavior rather than the substance of his remarks.

END OF SUMMARY.
