SUMMARY:
Vice President Joe Biden dominated the only vice presidential debate with an aggressive, outraged, and at times over-the-top performance against Republican Paul Ryan. Biden's goal was clear from the outset: push back hard against the Republicans' recent gains among working-class and blue-collar voters. He interrupted Ryan constantly, rolled his eyes, and groaned audibly, relishing the chance to rally the Democratic base and appeal to the working class. While Biden's behavior may have been deemed condescending and unhinged by some, the Obama campaign team relished in his passion and his ability to steal back the spotlight from the Republicans. Biden's performance, while demonstrative, also highlighted important policy differences between the two campaigns, including Medicare and tax policy. Biden defended the middle class and challenged Ryan to "show me a policy" that demonstrates his commitment to helping people. Overall, Biden's aggressive debating style and passionate defense of Democratic values may have provided a much-needed boost for the Democratic base.
END OF SUMMARY.
