SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the vice presidential debate against Rep. Paul Ryan, taking an aggressive tone and frequently interrupting Ryan. Biden's performance was seen as a rallying cry for the Democratic base, which was disappointed by President Barack Obama's performance in the previous debate. Two instant surveys showed mixed results, but Biden's goal was to push back against Ryan and Romney's policies. Biden repeatedly challenged Ryan's answers, often making it difficult for him to finish his thoughts. Republicans criticized Biden's behavior, calling him "unhinged" and "immature." However, Democrats saw Biden's passion and concern for the middle class as a winning strategy. The debate covered domestic and foreign policy issues, with Biden focusing on pushing back against Romney's policies and Ryan trying to appeal to moderate and independent voters.
