Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the letter from Georgetown professors. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

First, Paul Ryan is giving a speech at Georgetown. Before that, a group of professors and admins sent him a letter. The letter says he's misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget, which reduces deficit by cutting programs for the poor, elderly, and giving tax breaks to the wealthy. They mention he used the principle of subsidiarity, which he equates with federalism and limited government. But the letter argues that he's misapplying the doctrine, which actually requires higher government involvement to protect the poor.

Ryan responds by saying the letter doesn't speak for all bishops and that his budget is about a preferential option for the poor, not bigger government. He also mentions he was raised on Social Security, so he's not against government help. The event is still on, and he's looking forward to the dialogue.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: the letter's criticism, Ryan's defense using subsidiarity, the counter-argument about the doctrine, Ryan's response, and the event's status. Also, keep it under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Ryan's speech and the letter's criticism. Then explain the doctrine and Ryan's interpretation. Then the professors' counter-argument. Then Ryan's response, including his background and defense. Finally, mention the event is still happening.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like protecting the poor and the misuse of doctrine. Keep the language clear and concise. Let me try to draft that.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to speak at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from the Jesuit-founded school has criticized his use of Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget. They argue that Ryan misapplied the principle of subsidiarity, a Catholic teaching emphasizing local solutions, to justify cuts to programs aiding the poor, elderly, and sick, while also providing tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan defends his budget, stating it aligns with a "preferential option for the poor" without advocating for bigger government. The professors counter that subsidiarity does not endorse dismantling government but requires higher levels to protect vulnerable populations. Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledges the letter does not represent all U.S. bishops. The event remains scheduled, with Ryan emphasizing his commitment to addressing the debt crisis to protect the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
