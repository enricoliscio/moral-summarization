SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The group argues that Ryan's plan "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." They claim that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" as a "rationale for gutting government programs," when in fact it calls for local-level solutions to problems, but also requires higher levels of government. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress emphasize that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan's budget has been accused of dismantling government programs, which would ultimately hurt the poor the most. Despite the criticism, Ryan remains committed to his budget, claiming it will avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the worst.
