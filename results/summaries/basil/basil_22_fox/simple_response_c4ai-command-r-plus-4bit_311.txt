SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but not before receiving a letter of rebuke from nearly 90 professors and administrators associated with the Jesuit-founded school. The letter takes issue with Ryan's use of Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan, which includes drastic cuts to food programs and protections for vulnerable groups while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," interpreting it as support for small government and federalism. However, the Georgetown letter argues that Ryan is misappropriating this doctrine to rationalize the gutting of essential government programs. They emphasize that subsidiarity calls for local solutions but does not justify the dismantling of government responsibilities. Ryan defends his interpretation, claiming it affirms a "preferential option for the poor," but his budget proposals fall short of this moral imperative.

END OF SUMMARY.
