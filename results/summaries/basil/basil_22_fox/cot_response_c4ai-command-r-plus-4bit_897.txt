SUMMARY:
A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University has accused GOP Rep. Paul Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan, which they argue would harm struggling families and the elderly and sick while benefiting the wealthy. In a letter sent to Ryan ahead of his scheduled speech at the university, the group challenges his interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," stating that it should not be used as a rationale to dismantle government programs that help those in need. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has defended his budget by invoking the principle of subsidiarity and emphasizing federalism and local-level solutions. However, the writers of the letter argue that this teaching does not justify gutting government programs that provide essential services to the vulnerable. They also reference letters from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which assert that budgets should not disproportionately harm the poor. Ryan responded by stating that his budget reflects a "shared commitment to a preferential option for the poor," and he defended his stance on denying tax credits to illegal immigrants as a morally defensible policy.
