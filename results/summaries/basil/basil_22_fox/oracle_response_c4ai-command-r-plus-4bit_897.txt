SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget plan. In a letter sent to Ryan, the group challenges his interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," arguing that it should not be used as a rationale to dismantle government programs that help those in need. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has defended his budget by invoking the principle of subsidiarity, stating that it means having enough space in communities to interact and care for each other without big government crowding out civic society. However, the Georgetown letter asserts that Ryan's interpretation is a misuse of Catholic teaching and that his budget plan weakens protections for the vulnerable while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan stands by his budget, stating that it is in line with the preferential option for the poor, but the writers of the letter insist that his plan will only hurt those in need.
END OF SUMMARY.
