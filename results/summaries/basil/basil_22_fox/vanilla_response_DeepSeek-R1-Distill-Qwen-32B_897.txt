Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer. They provided an article about Paul Ryan and a letter from Georgetown professors. My task is to summarize this article concisely, within 200 words, using the specified tokens.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about Rep. Paul Ryan speaking at Georgetown, where a group of professors sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his budget. The budget cuts food programs and increases tax breaks for the wealthy. Ryan uses the principle of subsidiarity, which he ties to federalism, arguing for smaller government. The professors argue he's misusing the doctrine, as it doesn't justify gutting government programs. The bishops' conference supports this view, saying budgets shouldn't disproportionately hurt the poor. Ryan defends his stance, saying the letter doesn't represent all bishops and that his budget aims to prevent debt crisis harming the poor, not through bigger government. The event is still on.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I should include key elements: who (Ryan), what (criticized for misusing Catholic doctrine), where (Georgetown), why (budget cuts), and his defense. Also, mention the professors' arguments and the event status.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Ryan's speech, the criticism, his response, and the event details. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the main points without getting into too much detail.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all essential information succinctly. I'll start with the event, then the criticism, Ryan's defense, and conclude with the event status. I need to ensure clarity and flow, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions.

After drafting, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, I'll ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified. I should avoid any markdown formatting and keep the language clear and concise.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to speak at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators has criticized his use of Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget. The letter accuses Ryan of misusing the principle of subsidiarity, a Catholic teaching, to defend a budget that cuts food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly, and benefits the wealthy. Ryan has defended his budget, arguing that subsidiarity supports smaller government and local solutions. The professors argue that the doctrine does not justify dismantling government programs and cite the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which opposes disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. Ryan, a Catholic, maintains that his budget aims to prevent a debt crisis that would harm the poor, not through bigger government. The event remains scheduled, with Ryan looking forward to discussing his policy efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
