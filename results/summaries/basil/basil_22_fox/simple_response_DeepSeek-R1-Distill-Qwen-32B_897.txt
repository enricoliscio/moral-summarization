Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the letter from Georgetown professors. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Paul Ryan is going to speak at Georgetown University. Before that, he received a letter from nearly 90 professors and administrators. They're upset because they think he misused Catholic doctrine to support his budget, which they believe harms the poor, the elderly, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy.

Ryan has been talking about Catholic teachings, specifically subsidiarity, which he interprets as supporting smaller government and local solutions. The letter argues that he's misusing this doctrine to justify cutting government programs. They quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops saying budgets shouldn't disproportionately hurt the poor.

Ryan responds by saying the letter doesn't represent all bishops and that his budget isn't against the poor. He mentions his own background, being raised on Social Security, and defends his policies as not targeting the poor but rather following bipartisan policies, like denying tax credits to illegal immigrants.

So, the main points are: Ryan's speech, the letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine, his interpretation of subsidiarity, the professors' counterarguments, Ryan's defense, and the event still happening.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements, keeping the moral aspects clear. I should mention the criticism of misusing doctrine, Ryan's defense, and the opposing views on subsidiarity. Also, the event is still scheduled, which shows it's a significant issue.

I should structure it to first introduce Ryan and the letter, then explain the criticism, Ryan's stance, the bishops' perspective, and conclude with the event proceeding despite the controversy.

Let me make sure to keep it under 200 words and in clear, concise sentences. I'll avoid any markdown and just write the summary as requested.

SUMMARY:  
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, is set to speak at Georgetown University despite criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators who accuse him of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget proposals. The letter sent to Ryan argues that his invocation of the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, which emphasizes local solutions, is being used to justify cuts to essential services for the poor, elderly, and sick, while benefiting the wealthy. The professors claim Ryan’s interpretation neglects the doctrine’s requirement for higher levels of government to address societal needs. Ryan has defended his budget, stating it aligns with a "preferential option for the poor" but not for bigger government. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has opposed disproportionate cuts to essential services, a point Ryan disputes. The controversy highlights a clash over the moral framing of Catholic social teaching in policy. Ryan’s lecture at Georgetown remains scheduled, with his team emphasizing his commitment to helping the poor without expanding government. END OF SUMMARY.
