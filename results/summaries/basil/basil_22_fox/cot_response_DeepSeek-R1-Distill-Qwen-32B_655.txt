Alright, I need to tackle this query. The user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the context. It's about Paul Ryan giving a speech at Georgetown University and the criticism he's receiving from professors and administrators there. They're accusing him of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget plans, which they argue harm vulnerable groups like the poor and the elderly.

For STEP 1, I need to extract all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation related to ethics or values. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "misused," "decimates," "weakens," "gut," "dismantle," "preferential," "gratitude," "grateful," "commitment," "hurt," "opportunity," "oppressive," and "oppression." These words are used to convey judgment or evaluation in the context of the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible. I should start by introducing the main parties involved: Paul Ryan and the Georgetown professors. Then, outline the criticism they're leveling at him for misusing Catholic teachings to justify his budget cuts. Highlight the specific criticisms, like the impact on food programs, the elderly, and tax breaks for the wealthy. Mention Ryan's defense using the principle of subsidiarity and his response to the criticism. Finally, note the event is still scheduled and his stance on the preferential option for the poor without bigger government.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covering all key points while maintaining the moral framing. I should avoid introducing new information not present in the article and keep the language clear and concise.

Let me structure the summary step by step: introduce Ryan and the letter, describe the professors' criticism, mention Ryan's defense, include the bishops' stance, and conclude with the event status and Ryan's response. Make sure to incorporate the moral words identified earlier to preserve the author's framing.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, keeping an eye on the word count and the inclusion of the morally framed terms.

**SUMMARY:**  
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from Georgetown University professors and administrators for allegedly misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan, which they argue decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and benefits the wealthiest. Ryan, who invoked the Catholic principle of subsidiarity to defend his budget, claims it promotes local-level solutions and federalism. However, the letter accuses him of misappropriating the doctrine as a rationale for gutting government programs, emphasizing that Catholic teaching requires higher levels of government to protect the poor. Ryan disputes the letter, stating it does not represent all U.S. bishops. Despite the criticism, his lecture at Georgetown remains scheduled, with Ryan expressing gratitude for the opportunity to discuss his efforts to avert a debt crisis that would disproportionately hurt the poor. He reaffirms his commitment to a preferential option for the poor, though not through bigger government. END OF SUMMARY.
