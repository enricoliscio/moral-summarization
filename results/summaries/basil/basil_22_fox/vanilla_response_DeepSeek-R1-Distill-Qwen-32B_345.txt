Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Republican Congressman Paul Ryan speaking at Georgetown University. A group of professors and administrators from Georgetown sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his budget plan. They argue that he misapplied the principle of subsidiarity, which they say doesn't justify cutting government programs for the poor. Ryan, on the other hand, defends his budget, saying it's about reducing the federal role and empowering local communities. He also mentions that the bishops' conference doesn't speak for all bishops. The event is still scheduled, and Ryan plans to discuss his budget and his commitment to helping the poor without expanding government.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the criticism from Georgetown, the misuse of Catholic teachings, the budget's impact, Ryan's defense using subsidiarity, his response to the bishops, and the event's status.

Let me structure it step by step. First, introduce the criticism. Then explain Ryan's defense. Mention the bishops' conference and Ryan's response. Finally, note the event is still on and his stance on the budget and helping the poor.

I should make sure to include all key points without going into too much detail. Keep it concise and clear.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.
