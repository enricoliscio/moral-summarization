SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan has been accused of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget, which decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, sent Ryan a letter challenging his misuse of Catholic teaching. They argue that Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of "subsidiarity" is a misappropriation, using it as a rationale for gutting government programs. The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, stating that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan claims that his budget aims to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most, but the Georgetown professors argue that his policies would do the opposite. The event, hosted by Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, is still scheduled to take place.
