Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. The user provided a specific list of morally framed words that need to be included. I need to make sure I use as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long, probably around 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Paul Ryan giving a speech at Georgetown University, where some professors and administrators sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his budget. The letter accuses him of misusing the teachings to justify cuts in programs that help the poor and elderly, while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan defends his stance, saying he's following the principle of subsidiarity, which he interprets as supporting smaller government. He also mentions that his budget aims to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most.

Now, I need to extract the key elements and use the specified moral words. Words like "misused," "decimates," "weakens," "protections," "gut," "dismantle," "cuts," "crisis," "hurt" should be included. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Ryan's interpretation and the professors' criticism, making sure each moral term fits naturally into the narrative.

I should start by introducing Ryan and the event, then mention the letter and its accusations. Next, explain Ryan's defense using the principle of subsidiarity. Finally, note the ongoing debate and the event still happening. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step. First sentence: Introduce Ryan and the event. Second: The letter's accusations. Third: Ryan's defense and his interpretation. Fourth: The bishops' stance. Fifth: The event is still on. Make sure each moral word is appropriately placed without forcing them in.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together, ensuring the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral framing words.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to speak at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators has criticized him for misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan. They argue that Ryan has misappropriated the principle of subsidiarity, which they claim does not serve as a rationale for gutting government programs. The letter accuses Ryan's budget of decimating food programs for struggling families, weakening protections for the elderly and sick, and giving tax breaks to the wealthiest. Ryan defends his stance, stating that the principle of subsidiarity supports smaller government and a preferential option for the poor, which does not mean bigger government. He also emphasizes his budget's aim to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor first and worst. The debate over the proper use of Catholic social teaching in policy continues as Ryan prepares to deliver his speech. END OF SUMMARY.
