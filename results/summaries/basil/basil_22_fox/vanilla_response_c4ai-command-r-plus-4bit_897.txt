SUMMARY: Republican Congressman Paul Ryan is set to give a speech at Georgetown University, but not before receiving a letter of criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators associated with the Jesuit-founded school. The letter takes issue with Ryan's interpretation of Catholic doctrine to support his GOP House budget, which proposes significant cuts to social programs and tax breaks for the wealthy. Ryan has cited the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," interpreting it as support for smaller government and federalism. However, the Georgetown letter argues that Ryan misappropriated the doctrine and that Catholic social teaching does not support dismantling government programs that aid struggling families, the elderly, and the sick. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has defended his budget, stating that it aligns with the principle of subsidiarity and that he remains committed to helping the poor. The event at Georgetown is still scheduled to take place, with Ryan intending to foster a dialogue on addressing the nation's debt crisis.
END OF SUMMARY.
