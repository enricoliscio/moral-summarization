SUMMARY:
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 Georgetown University professors and administrators for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. They argue that his plan decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to justify his budget, but the letter writers claim he has misappropriated it as a rationale for gutting government programs. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also spoken out against disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan remains committed to his budget, which he claims will avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst. He looks forward to affirming a shared commitment to a preferential option for the poor, but not necessarily a preferential option for bigger government. END OF SUMMARY.
