Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the letter from Georgetown professors. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Paul Ryan, a GOP Representative, is speaking at Georgetown University. Before that, he received a letter from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown, a Jesuit-founded school. They're criticizing him for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget plan.

The letter appreciates Ryan's willingness to discuss Catholic teachings but challenges his misuse of them. They argue that his budget plan harms food programs, elderly protections, and benefits the wealthy with tax breaks. Ryan has been talking about the principle of subsidiarity, which he says supports local governance and smaller government. However, the professors counter that this principle doesn't justify gutting government programs and quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, emphasizing that budgets shouldn't cut essential services for the poor disproportionately.

Ryan defends his stance, saying the bishops' letters don't represent all bishops and that his approach aligns with a preferential option for the poor without bigger government. He also mentions his background on Social Security and defends his budget on Fox News, citing bipartisan support for certain policies.

The event at Georgetown is still scheduled, with Ryan's spokesperson emphasizing his commitment to helping the poor through his budget.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the letter from Georgetown, Ryan's use of subsidiarity, the professors' counterarguments, Ryan's defense, and the event's status.

I should ensure the summary is clear and concise, highlighting the conflict between Ryan's budget and the professors' criticism based on Catholic teachings. Also, include Ryan's defense and the ongoing event.
