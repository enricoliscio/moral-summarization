SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter accuses Ryan of misappropriating the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The writers argue that Ryan's interpretation of subsidiarity as a rationale for gutting government programs is a misuse of Catholic teaching, which actually requires higher levels of government to address social issues. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also disagrees with Ryan's stance, stating that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan claims his budget aims to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst, but critics argue that his policies would do just that. END OF SUMMARY.
