SUMMARY:
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University for allegedly *misusing* Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget plan. In a letter sent to Ryan, the group challenges his interpretation of Catholic teaching, arguing that he has *misappropriated* the principle of "subsidiarity" as a "rationale for *dismantling* government programs." They assert that while subsidiarity calls for local-level solutions, it does not justify drastic cuts to essential services for the poor, elderly, and sick. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defends his budget by appealing to the concept of "subsidiarity" and federalism, claiming it allows for communities to take care of each other without government crowding. Ryan's upcoming lecture at Georgetown remains scheduled, with a spokesperson affirming Ryan's *shared commitment* to "a preferential option for the poor". However, critics argue that Ryan's budget proposal would ultimately *hurt* those in need. Additionally, Ryan is criticized for *denying* tax credits to illegal immigrants, though he defends this by stating that he is merely *following through* on existing bipartisan policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
