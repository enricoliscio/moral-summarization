SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget plan. The group argues that Ryan's plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy. They claim Ryan misinterpreted the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," which emphasizes local-level solutions, as a justification for dismantling government programs. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also expressed disagreement with Ryan's budget, stating that it cannot rely on disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. Despite the criticism, Ryan remains committed to his budget plan, which he believes will help avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most. He is scheduled to give a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday.

END OF SUMMARY.
