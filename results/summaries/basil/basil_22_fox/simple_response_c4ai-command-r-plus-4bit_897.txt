SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, a Catholic, is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget plan. In response to Ryan's invocation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," the group argues that he is misappropriating the doctrine as a rationale for cutting government programs that help the poor and vulnerable. They emphasize that while subsidiarity calls for local-level solutions, it does not justify the dismantling of government responsibilities. The professors and administrators also cite the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, which state that budgets should not disproportionately cut essential services for those in need. Ryan, who is set to speak at Georgetown University, defends his budget by referencing his own personal experiences and bipartisan policies, while a spokesperson affirms his commitment to helping the poor.

END OF SUMMARY.
