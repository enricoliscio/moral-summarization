Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Paul Ryan and some criticism from Georgetown University professors. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ryan is giving a speech at Georgetown, but some professors are criticizing him for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget. They sent a letter saying he's misusing teachings to cut programs for the poor, elderly, and sick. Ryan uses the principle of subsidiarity, which he says supports smaller government. The professors argue that he's misinterpreting it as a way to dismantle government programs, not just to decentralize. They quote the bishops saying budgets shouldn't disproportionately cut services for the poor. Ryan defends his stance, saying the bishops don't all agree, and his budget aims to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor.

Now, the user wants the summary to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. The list includes: misused, misuse, decimates, weakens, protections, gives, crowd, interact, governs, misappropriated, gutting, dismantle, cuts, said, avert, crisis, hurt.

I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate. I should structure the summary to highlight the criticism of Ryan's misuse of doctrine, the impact on vulnerable groups, and his defense using the principle of subsidiarity.

I'll start by stating that Georgetown professors criticized Ryan for misusing Catholic doctrine. Then mention the letter's points about decimating food programs, weakening protections, and giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Include that Ryan uses subsidiarity to argue for smaller government, but the professors say he misappropriated it to gut programs. They quote bishops about not cutting essential services. Ryan counters that the bishops don't all agree and that his budget aims to avert a crisis that would hurt the poor.

I should keep it concise, around 200 words, and make sure all the key moral terms are included naturally.

SUMMARY: Georgetown University professors have criticized GOP Rep. Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget, which they argue decimates food programs, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan invoked the principle of subsidiarity, a Catholic teaching emphasizing local governance, to defend his stance. However, the professors argue he misappropriated the doctrine as a rationale for gutting government programs. They cite the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who warn against budgets that disproportionately cut essential services for the poor. Ryan counters that the bishops do not all agree and that his budget aims to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor first and worst. The event remains scheduled, with Ryan emphasizing a "preferential option for the poor" without favoring bigger government. END OF SUMMARY.
