SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but not before receiving a letter of reprimand from nearly 90 professors and administrators associated with the Jesuit-founded school. The letter accuses Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan, which they argue would decimate food programs and weaken protections for vulnerable groups while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan has previously invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," interpreting it as a call for smaller government that empowers local communities. However, the Georgetown letter challenges this interpretation, stating that subsidiarity is not a justification for gutting government programs and that it requires higher levels of government as well. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has defended his budget, claiming it averts a debt crisis and upholds a preferential option for the poor. 

END OF SUMMARY.
