SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to speak at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators has sent him a letter criticizing his interpretation of Catholic doctrine to support his budget plan. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to justify his budget, arguing that it promotes local solutions over big government. However, the Georgetown letter argues that Ryan misused the doctrine to justify gutting government programs and giving tax breaks to the wealthy. The writers acknowledge the importance of local solutions but emphasize that the doctrine does not support dismantling government. They also cite the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters expressing concern about budgets that disproportionately cut services to the poor. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defended his interpretation and said the letters do not represent the views of all US bishops. The event at Georgetown is still scheduled, with Ryan intending to discuss his efforts to address the debt crisis and his commitment to helping the poor.
END OF SUMMARY.
