SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The group argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy. They claim Ryan misinterpreted the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" as a rationale for gutting government programs, when in fact it calls for local-level solutions but also requires higher levels of government. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also expressed disagreement with Ryan's views. Despite the criticism, Ryan will still deliver a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, where he will discuss his efforts to address the national debt crisis and his commitment to a preferential option for the poor.
