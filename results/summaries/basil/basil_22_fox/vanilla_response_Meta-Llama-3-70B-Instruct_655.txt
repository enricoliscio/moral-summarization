SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but not before receiving a letter from nearly 90 professors and administrators criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan, which cuts food programs for struggling families and gives tax breaks to the wealthy, misuses Catholic teaching on "subsidiarity," which emphasizes local-level solutions to problems. The writers quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, stating that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has defended his budget, saying it is necessary to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most. The event is still scheduled to take place on Thursday morning.

END OF SUMMARY.
