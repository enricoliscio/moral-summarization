SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 Georgetown University professors and administrators, who accuse him of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. They argue that his plan decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to justify his budget, but the professors claim he has misappropriated it as a "rationale for gutting government programs." They emphasize that the teaching calls for local-level solutions, but also requires higher levels of government to ensure essential services to the poor. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also spoken out against Ryan's budget, saying it cannot rely on disproportionate cuts to the poor. Ryan remains committed to his budget, claiming it will avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most. END OF SUMMARY.
