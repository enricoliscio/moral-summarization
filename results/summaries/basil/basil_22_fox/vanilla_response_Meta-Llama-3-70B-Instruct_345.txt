SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but not before facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school. They accuse Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget, which they claim "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." Ryan has cited the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to argue for smaller government, but the Georgetown letter argues that this teaching does not justify dismantling government programs. The letter also quotes from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which opposes disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. Ryan's spokesman defended the congressman's commitment to helping the poor, but the event has sparked controversy over Ryan's interpretation of Catholic doctrine.

END OF SUMMARY.
