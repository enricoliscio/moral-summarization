Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and Georgetown University. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is going to speak at Georgetown University. Before that, there's some pushback from professors and administrators at Georgetown. They sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his budget plan. The letter says he's misusing Catholic teachings to defend a budget that cuts food programs, weakens protections for the elderly, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy.

Ryan has been talking about the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, which he says supports his budget by emphasizing local solutions and limiting big government. The letter argues that he's misapplying this doctrine, saying it's not an excuse to dismantle government programs. They reference the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops who oppose disproportionate cuts to services for the poor.

Ryan responds by saying the letters don't represent all bishops. Georgetown is still hosting his speech, and his spokesperson emphasizes his commitment to helping the poor without necessarily increasing government size. Ryan also defends his budget, saying it's about following existing policies, like denying tax credits to illegal immigrants, which has bipartisan support.

So, the key points are: Ryan's speech at Georgetown, criticism from professors about misusing Catholic teachings, Ryan's defense using subsidiarity, the bishops' opposition, and Ryan's stance on his budget and policies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include all these elements concisely.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, is scheduled to speak at Georgetown University despite criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators who argue he misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter from Georgetown faculty accuses Ryan of misapplying the principle of subsidiarity, which emphasizes local solutions, to justify cuts to food programs, protections for the elderly, and tax breaks for the wealthy. Ryan has defended his budget, citing subsidiarity as a rationale for limiting big government, but the letter asserts this principle does not justify dismantling essential services for the poor. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also opposed Ryan's budget, stating it disproportionately harms the poor. Ryan counters that the bishops' views are not unified and emphasizes his commitment to helping the poor without expanding government. The speech remains scheduled, with Ryan's spokesperson highlighting his focus on avoiding a debt crisis that would disproportionately affect the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
