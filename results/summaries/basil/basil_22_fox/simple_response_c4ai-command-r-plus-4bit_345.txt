SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, ahead of his scheduled speech at the university. In a letter sent to Ryan, the group accuses him of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget plan, which they argue would harm struggling families, the elderly, and the sick while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan has previously invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to defend his budget, interpreting it as a call for smaller government and more local control. However, the Georgetown group counters that subsidiarity does not justify dismantling government programs and that Ryan is misappropriating Catholic teaching to justify his budget. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defended his budget, stating that it aligns with the principle of subsidiarity and a "preferential option for the poor." The debate highlights the complex intersection of religion, politics, and moral values in American society.
END OF SUMMARY.
