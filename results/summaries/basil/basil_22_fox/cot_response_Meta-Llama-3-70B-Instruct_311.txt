SUMMARY:
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but not before facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school. They accuse Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget, which they argue decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The letter challenges Ryan's interpretation of Catholic teaching, particularly the principle of subsidiarity, which he claims means limiting government intervention to allow for civic society to take care of people. The critics argue that this principle does not justify dismantling government programs and requires a preferential option for the poor. Ryan remains committed to advancing a thoughtful dialogue on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst. END OF SUMMARY.
