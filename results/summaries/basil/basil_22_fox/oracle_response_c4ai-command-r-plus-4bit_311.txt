SUMMARY: Georgetown University professors and administrators are calling out GOP Rep. Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to justify his budget plan, which decimates food programs and weakens protections for the vulnerable. Ryan has invoked the principle of "subsidiarity," interpreting it as a rationale for reducing the role of the federal government in favor of local communities. However, the Georgetown community argues that this interpretation is a misappropriation of Catholic doctrine and that Ryan's budget plan disproportionately hurts the poor and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defends his plan by claiming it averts a debt crisis and empowers communities to take care of their own. The debate highlights the complex interplay between religious doctrine and political ideologies, with Ryan emphasizing individual and community empowerment over government protections for the vulnerable.
