SUMMARY: Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, a Catholic, is set to give a speech at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C. However, he has received a letter of rebuke from nearly 90 professors and administrators at the university, who accuse him of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget plan. The letter challenges Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," arguing that it should not be used as a rationale to dismantle government programs that help the poor and vulnerable. Ryan has defended his budget, citing the principle of subsidiarity as promoting local solutions over big government. The writers of the letter counter that subsidiarity does not justify drastic cuts to essential services for those in need. Ryan, who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, maintains that his budget reflects a commitment to helping the poor, but the writers of the letter argue that his plan gives tax breaks to the wealthy while hurting struggling families. Despite the controversy, Ryan's speech at Georgetown is still scheduled to proceed.
END OF SUMMARY.
