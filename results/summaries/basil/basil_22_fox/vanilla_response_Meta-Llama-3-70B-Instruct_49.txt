SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but not before facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school. They accuse Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget, which they claim "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." The letter argues that Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" is incorrect, and that it does not justify dismantling government programs. Ryan has defended his budget, saying it is necessary to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most. The event is still scheduled to take place, with Ryan looking forward to discussing his efforts to address the debt crisis while affirming a commitment to helping the poor.
