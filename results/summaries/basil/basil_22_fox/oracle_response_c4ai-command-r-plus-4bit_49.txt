SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from a group of Georgetown University professors and administrators for misappropriating Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan that weakens protections for the vulnerable and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. In a letter sent to Ryan, the group challenges his use of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," arguing that it should not be used as a rationale to gut government programs that help those in need. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has defended his budget by invoking the principle of "subsidiarity," interpreting it as support for local governance and smaller government. However, the Georgetown letter emphasizes that subsidiarity does not justify the dismantling of government programs that provide essential services to the poor and vulnerable. Ryan's budget plan has been criticized for disproportionately cutting aid to struggling families and the elderly while benefiting the rich. Ryan, who will be speaking at Georgetown University, stands by his interpretation of Catholic social teaching and believes his budget averts a debt crisis that would hurt the poor.
END OF SUMMARY.
