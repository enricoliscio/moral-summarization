Alright, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article about Paul Ryan and a specific task: first, identify morally framed words, then summarize the article while preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about GOP Rep. Paul Ryan speaking at Georgetown University. The article mentions a letter from professors and administrators criticizing Ryan for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget. The key here is the moral framingâ€”words that carry ethical or moral implications.

For STEP 1, I need to list all single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "misused," "challenging," "decimates," "weakens," "gut," "dismantle," "preferential," "grateful," "hurt," "deny," "opportunity," "grateful," and "shared." These words convey judgment or ethical implications.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral language intact. I'll start by introducing Ryan and the criticism. Then, I'll mention the letter's arguments, Ryan's defense using subsidiarity, and the counterarguments. I'll also include Ryan's background and his stance on tax credits. Finally, I'll note that the event is still scheduled.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral disputes without getting too bogged down in details. It's important to maintain the ethical nuances from the original text to preserve the author's framing.

I also need to structure the response correctly, starting with STEP 1, listing each word with an asterisk, then the SUMMARY section. Keeping everything concise and within the word limit is crucial.

Double-checking to make sure all morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral angles. That should cover the user's requirements effectively.

**STEP 1:**  
* Misused  
* Challenging  
* Decimates  
* Weakens  
* Gut  
* Dismantle  
* Preferential  
* Grateful  
* Hurt  
* Deny  
* Opportunity  
* Grateful  
* Shared  

**SUMMARY:**  
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from Georgetown University professors for allegedly misusing Catholic doctrine to defend his budget plan. The letter accuses Ryan of misappropriating the principle of subsidiarity, arguing it does not justify gutting government programs that aid the poor, elderly, and sick. Ryan, a Catholic, defends his budget, stating it aligns with Catholic social teaching's "preferential option for the poor" but not for bigger government. The letter challenges his interpretation, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' stance that budgets should not disproportionately harm the vulnerable. Ryan acknowledges the letter does not represent all bishops and plans to continue his advocacy, including defending tax credits for illegal immigrants as policy-aligned. The event remains scheduled, with Ryan expressing gratitude for the opportunity to discuss his efforts to avert a debt crisis that would disproportionately hurt the poor.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
