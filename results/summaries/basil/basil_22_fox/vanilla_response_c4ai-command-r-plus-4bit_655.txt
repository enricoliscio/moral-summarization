SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, ahead of his scheduled speech at the university. In a letter, they accuse Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget plan, which they argue would hurt struggling families, the elderly, and the sick while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to defend his budget, interpreting it as a call for smaller government that empowers local communities. However, the Georgetown letter argues that Ryan's interpretation is a misappropriation of the doctrine and that true Catholic social teaching requires higher levels of government involvement to protect the poor and vulnerable. Ryan has defended his budget, stating that it aligns with Catholic values and that he remains committed to helping those in need. A spokesman for Ryan confirmed that the speech at Georgetown will go ahead as planned, with Ryan aiming to foster a "thoughtful dialogue" on addressing the debt crisis.
END OF SUMMARY.
