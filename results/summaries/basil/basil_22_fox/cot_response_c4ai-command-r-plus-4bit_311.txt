SUMMARY: 
A group of Georgetown University professors and administrators has sent a letter to GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, accusing him of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan. The letter challenges Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," arguing that it should not be used as a rationale for gutting government programs that help those in need. While Ryan claims that his budget plan is a "shared commitment to a preferential option for the poor," the writers of the letter contend that it would decimate food programs and weaken protections for the elderly and sick, while also giving tax breaks to the wealthy. They assert that Catholic social teaching should inform policy-making and that Ryan's plan falls short in defending the poor and vulnerable. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defends his plan by stating that it does not deny support to those who need it and that he is committed to averting a debt crisis that would hurt the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
