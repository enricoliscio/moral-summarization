Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. Let me first read through the article to understand the context.

The article is about Paul Ryan, a GOP representative, speaking at Georgetown University. A group of professors and administrators from Georgetown sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his budget plan. They argue he's misusing the teachings, specifically the principle of subsidiarity, to justify cutting government programs that help the poor, the elderly, and the sick. Ryan defends his stance, saying he's following Catholic teachings and that bigger government isn't the solution.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: misused, misuse, decimates, weakens, protections, gives, crowd, interact, governs, misappropriated, gutting, dismantle, cuts, said, avert, crisis, hurt.

I should make sure these words are included in the summary. I'll start by outlining the main points: the letter from Georgetown, their criticism of Ryan's misuse of Catholic doctrine, the specific programs affected, Ryan's defense using subsidiarity, and the event still proceeding.

I'll structure the summary to include the key points and incorporate the moral terms. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from Georgetown University professors and administrators for allegedly misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. In a letter, they accuse Ryan of misappropriating the principle of subsidiarity, arguing it does not justify gutting government programs that protect the poor, elderly, and sick. Ryan, however, defends his budget, stating it aligns with Catholic teachings and promotes a preferential option for the poor without advocating for bigger government. The letter highlights concerns that Ryan's plan decimates essential services, weakens protections, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan maintains that his approach averts a debt crisis that could hurt vulnerable populations first. Despite the criticism, his lecture at Georgetown remains scheduled. END OF SUMMARY.
