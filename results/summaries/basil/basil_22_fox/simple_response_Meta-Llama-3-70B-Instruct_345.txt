SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few," contradicting Catholic social teaching. Ryan has invoked the Catholic principle of "subsidiarity," which emphasizes local-level solutions, but the letter contends that he has misappropriated this teaching as a "rationale for gutting government programs." The writers quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, stating that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan's response emphasizes his commitment to a "preferential option for the poor," but not necessarily through bigger government.
