Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Paul Ryan and a letter from Georgetown professors. The professors are criticizing Ryan for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget. They mention subsidiarity and how he's using it to justify cutting programs for the poor. Ryan counters that the letter doesn't represent all bishops and that his approach is about federalism, not bigger government. 

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: who sent the letter, their criticism, Ryan's defense, and the context of the budget and Catholic teachings. Also, I should keep the moral aspect clear, showing both sides' arguments. I'll need to condense this into under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main arguments without getting too detailed. 

I should start with the letter from Georgetown, then Ryan's response, and mention the upcoming speech. I'll make sure to include the bishops' stance and Ryan's counterpoints. Keeping the summary concise but informative is key here. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all important elements are covered.

SUMMARY: A group of nearly 90 Georgetown University professors and administrators has criticized Republican Congressman Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget proposal, which they argue harms the poor, elderly, and sick while benefiting the wealthy. In a letter, they accused Ryan of misinterpreting the principle of subsidiarity, which they argue emphasizes local solutions but does not justify dismantling government programs. Ryan, who has invoked Catholic doctrine in interviews, defends his approach as aligning with federalism and a "preferential option for the poor," though he argues this does not mean supporting bigger government. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also weighed in, stating budgets must not disproportionately cut essential services for the poor. Ryan, who is Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, insists the letter does not represent all bishops' views. Despite the criticism, Ryan's speech at Georgetown remains scheduled, with his team emphasizing his commitment to addressing the debt crisis and its impact on vulnerable populations. END OF SUMMARY.
