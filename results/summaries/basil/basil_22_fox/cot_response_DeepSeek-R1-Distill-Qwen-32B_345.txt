Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a summary using those words.

Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Paul Ryan speaking at Georgetown University and the criticism from professors and administrators there. They argue that he misused Catholic doctrine to support his budget, which they say harms the poor and gives tax breaks to the wealthy.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation related to ethics or values. Let's go through the article and pick them out.

Looking at the article, words like "misused," "decimates," "weakens," "gut," "disproportionate," "preferential," "gratitude," "affirm," "shared," "commitment," "option," "bigger," "hurts," "deny," "support," "opportunity," "interact," "crowd out," "protection," "provision," "dismantle," "govern," "best," "local," "solution," "federalism," "big," "smallest," "space," "interact," "take care," "poor," "first," "worst," "gratitude," "affirm," "shared," "commitment," "option," "bigger," "hurts," "deny," "support," "opportunity," "interact," "crowd out," "protection," "provision," "dismantle," "govern," "best," "local," "solution," "federalism," "big," "smallest," "space," "interact," "take care," "poor," "first," "worst."

Wait, some of these might be repeated or not exactly single words. Let me make sure each is a single word and relevant to morality.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral elements intact. The key points are the criticism of Ryan's budget using Catholic doctrine, the misuse of subsidiarity, the impact on the poor, and Ryan's defense.

I should structure the summary to include the main actors, the conflict, and the arguments from both sides. Make sure to include the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft it: Ryan is speaking at Georgetown, but professors criticized him for misusing Catholic teachings to support a budget that harms the poor. They argue he misapplied subsidiarity, which they say doesn't justify dismantling government programs. Ryan defends his budget, emphasizing his commitment to helping the poor without bigger government. The event is still on.

I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many moral words as possible without making it too wordy. Let me check the word count and adjust if necessary.

I think that's a solid summary. It captures the moral conflict and the key points from both sides. Now, I'll present the step-by-step as per the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from Georgetown University professors for allegedly misusing Catholic doctrine to defend his budget, which they claim decimates food programs for struggling families and weakens protections for the elderly and sick. The professors argue that Ryan misapplied the principle of subsidiarity, a Catholic teaching, to justify gutting government programs. They emphasize that subsidiarity does not provide a free pass to dismantle government but instead requires higher levels of government to act. Ryan, however, defends his budget, stating it reflects a preferential option for the poor without supporting bigger government. The event, where Ryan will discuss his budget, remains scheduled, with Ryan expressing gratitude for the opportunity to advance dialogue on his efforts to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor first and worst. END OF SUMMARY.
