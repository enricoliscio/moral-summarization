SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to give a speech at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from the Jesuit-founded school have criticized him for misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget plan. In their letter, they argue that Ryan's plan "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," interpreting it as support for federalism and local communities. However, the Georgetown letter contends that Ryan misappropriated this teaching as a rationale for "gutting government programs," and that it is not a justification for dismantling government responsibilities. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defended his budget, stating that it reflects a "preferential option for the poor," and that he aims to avert a debt crisis that would hurt them the most.
