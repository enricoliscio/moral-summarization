SUMMARY:
Rep. Paul Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, is facing criticism from nearly 90 Georgetown University professors and administrators for his alleged misuse of Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget plan. They argue that Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" as a rationale for local-level solutions and smaller government misrepresents the doctrine, which they say does not endorse the dismantling of government programs that aid the poor and vulnerable. Ryan, who will be speaking at Georgetown, defends his budget, citing the principle of subsidiarity and his commitment to a preferential option for the poor, not bigger government. The debate highlights the complex interplay between religious doctrine and political policy, with Ryan and his critics interpreting Catholic teachings differently in the context of deficit reduction and social safety net programs.
