SUMMARY: A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University have penned a letter to GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, criticizing his interpretation of Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget plan. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to argue for smaller government and more local-level solutions to problems. However, the Georgetown letter argues that Ryan is misappropriating this teaching as a reason to dismantle government programs that help the poor and vulnerable. They emphasize that Catholic social teaching calls for a "preferential option for the poor," which cannot be achieved through his proposed budget cuts. Ryan stands by his interpretation and believes his budget plan aligns with his values, but the professors and administrators at Georgetown University remain concerned about the potential impact on struggling families and the sick and elderly.
END OF SUMMARY.
