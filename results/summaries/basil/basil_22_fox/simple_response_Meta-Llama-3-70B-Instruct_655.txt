SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is being criticized by nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy. The professors claim that Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" is a misguided rationale for gutting government programs. They emphasize that the teaching calls for local-level solutions, but also requires higher levels of government to ensure essential services to the poor. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also disagrees with Ryan's views, stating that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts to essential services. Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, defends his budget, claiming it is necessary to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most.
