Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Paul Ryan giving a speech at Georgetown University and the criticism he's receiving from professors and administrators there. They sent a letter accusing him of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget, which they claim harms the poor and weakens protections for the elderly. 

First, I should identify the key points: Ryan is using Catholic teachings like subsidiarity to justify his budget, but Georgetown argues he's misusing it. The budget cuts food programs and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. The letter mentions the bishops' stance on not cutting essential services for the poor. Ryan defends his position, saying it's about smaller government and helping the poor through community efforts, not bigger government. The event is still on, and Ryan plans to discuss his views.

I need to include the morally charged words like "misused," "decimates," "weakens," "protections," "gutting," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Ryan's use of Catholic doctrine and the criticism from Georgetown, emphasizing the moral implications of his budget. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, making sure to include the main arguments from both sides. Also, I should mention the event still happening and Ryan's defense, using the exact terms from the article to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from Georgetown University professors and administrators for allegedly misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget. They argue his plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan, invoking the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, claims it supports smaller government and community-based solutions. However, the letter accuses him of misappropriating the doctrine as a rationale for gutting government programs. The writers emphasize that subsidiarity does not justify dismantling essential services but requires higher levels of government to protect the poor. Ryan defends his budget, stating it aligns with a preferential option for the poor, not bigger government. The event remains scheduled, with Ryan set to discuss his efforts to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor first. END OF SUMMARY.
