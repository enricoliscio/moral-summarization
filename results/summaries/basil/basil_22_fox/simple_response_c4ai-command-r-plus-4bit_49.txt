SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to deliver a speech at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators affiliated with the Jesuit-founded school have taken issue with his interpretation of Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan. In a letter, they argue that Ryan's budget, which slashes programs for the needy and gives tax breaks to the wealthy, contradicts the principles of Catholic social teaching. While Ryan cites the principle of "subsidiarity," the writers counter that it is not a justification for dismantling government programs and that higher levels of government are necessary to ensure the common good. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also expressed disagreement with Ryan's claims. Ryan, a Catholic himself, stands by his interpretation, claiming that his budget reflects a commitment to helping the poor by reducing government involvement. This incident highlights the complex ethical considerations in budget allocation and the potential consequences for vulnerable communities. END OF SUMMARY.
