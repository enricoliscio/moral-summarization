SUMMARY:
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The group argues that Ryan's budget "decimates" food programs for "struggling" families, "radically weakens" protections for the "elderly" and "sick", and gives more tax breaks to the "wealthiest" few. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to justify his budget, but the letter writers claim he has misappropriated it as a "rationale for gutting government programs". The Georgetown University letter urges Ryan to reconsider his budget, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, which emphasize that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan remains committed to his budget, claiming it is necessary to avert a looming debt crisis that would "hurt" the poor the "worst".
END OF SUMMARY.
