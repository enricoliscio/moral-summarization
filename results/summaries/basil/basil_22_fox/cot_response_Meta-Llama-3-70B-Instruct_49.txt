SUMMARY:
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The professors claim that Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" is a misuse of the doctrine, which they say requires higher levels of government to protect the poor. Ryan defends his budget, saying it is necessary to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst. He also emphasizes the importance of a preferential option for the poor, but not necessarily a preferential option for bigger government. END OF SUMMARY.
