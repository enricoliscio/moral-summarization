SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The group argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy. They claim that Ryan's invocation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" is a misappropriation, as it does not justify dismantling government programs. The professors and administrators quote from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, stating that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, defends his budget, saying it is necessary to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most. The moral framing of this article suggests that Ryan's budget plan is morally questionable and that his use of Catholic doctrine is a thinly veiled attempt to justify harmful policies.
