SUMMARY: 
A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University has sent a letter to GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, criticizing him for misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan. The letter accuses Ryan of misappropriating the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" as a rationale for dismantling government programs and giving tax breaks to the wealthy, while drastically reducing aid for those in need. Ryan, a Catholic himself, has defended his budget by invoking the principle of subsidiarity, interpreting it as support for local governance and smaller government. However, the Georgetown community members argue that this interpretation is a misuse of Catholic social teaching, which prioritizes a preferential option for the poor. Ryan responded by stating his gratitude for the opportunity to engage in dialogue and affirm his shared commitment to helping those in need, while also advocating for limited government involvement. The letter also highlights Ryan's defense of his budget plan against criticism from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, emphasizing the denial of tax credits to illegal immigrants as a form of "following through on policy."
