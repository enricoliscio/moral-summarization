SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is being criticized by nearly 90 professors and administrators from Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to justify his budget, but the letter claims he has misappropriated this teaching as a "rationale for gutting government programs." The writers argue that subsidiarity calls for local-level solutions, but also requires higher levels of government and cannot be used to dismantle essential services to the poor. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also spoken out against disproportionate cuts to essential services. Ryan's response is that his budget is necessary to avert a debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most.
