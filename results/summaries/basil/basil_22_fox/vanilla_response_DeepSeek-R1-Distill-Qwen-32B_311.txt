Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the Georgetown University letter. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article talks about GOP Rep. Paul Ryan giving a speech at Georgetown University. Before that, a group of professors and admins from Georgetown sent him a letter. They're criticizing him for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his budget plan. The budget is supposed to reduce the deficit, but the letter argues that Ryan is misapplying Catholic teachings like subsidiarity, which he uses to justify cutting government programs.

Ryan has been using the principle of subsidiarity, which he equates with federalism, to argue for smaller government. The letter points out that while subsidiarity does call for local solutions, it doesn't mean dismantling government entirely. They also reference the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops who say budgets shouldn't disproportionately cut services for the poor.

Ryan defends his stance, saying the bishops don't all agree with the letter. He also mentions his own background, being raised on Social Security, and defends his budget as not targeting the poor. The event at Georgetown is still happening, and Ryan's spokesperson emphasizes his commitment to helping the poor without expanding government.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: who sent the letter, the criticism of misusing Catholic doctrine, Ryan's defense using subsidiarity, the bishops' stance, and the event still proceeding.

Let me structure it: start with Ryan's speech, mention the letter's criticism, explain subsidiarity and the counterarguments, Ryan's response, and conclude with the event status.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is scheduled to speak at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from the Jesuit-founded school has criticized his use of Catholic doctrine to justify his deficit-reducing budget. The letter accuses Ryan of misappropriating Catholic teachings, particularly the principle of subsidiarity, to defend a budget that cuts food programs, weakens protections for the elderly, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. Ryan has defended his budget, stating that subsidiarity supports local solutions and opposes big government. The letter argues that subsidiarity does not justify dismantling government programs and references the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' stance that budgets must not disproportionately harm the poor. Ryan, a Catholic, claims the letter does not represent all bishops and emphasizes his commitment to helping the poor without expanding government. The event remains scheduled, with Ryan's spokesperson highlighting his focus on avoiding a debt crisis that would harm the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
