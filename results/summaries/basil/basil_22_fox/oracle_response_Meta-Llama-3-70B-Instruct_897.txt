SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 Georgetown University professors and administrators, who accuse him of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The professors claim that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" as a rationale for gutting government programs, when in fact it requires higher levels of government involvement. Ryan has defended his budget, saying it aims to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the most. However, the Georgetown professors argue that his plan would do just that, hurting those who need protection the most. The controversy highlights the tension between Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social teaching and the concerns of the Georgetown community.
