SUMMARY:

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators at Georgetown University, a Jesuit-founded school, for misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget. The letter argues that Ryan's budget plan decimates food programs for struggling families, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy, contradicting Catholic social teaching. Ryan has invoked the Catholic principle of "subsidiarity" to justify reducing government programs, but the letter claims this is a misinterpretation, as the principle calls for local-level solutions but does not justify dismantling government. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also spoken out against disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan has defended his budget, claiming it will help the poor in the long run, but critics argue that his policies will harm the most vulnerable.

END OF SUMMARY.
