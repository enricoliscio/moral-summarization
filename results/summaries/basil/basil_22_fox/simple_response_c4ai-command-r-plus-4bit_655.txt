SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to give a speech at Georgetown University, but a group of nearly 90 professors and administrators from the Jesuit-founded school have criticized him for misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget plan. Ryan has invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" to defend his budget, arguing that it promotes local-level solutions and prevents government overreach. However, the Georgetown letter argues that Ryan is misappropriating this teaching to justify cutting government programs that help the poor and vulnerable. They argue that Catholic social teaching calls for a "preferential option for the poor," which cannot be achieved by simply favoring smaller government. Ryan, a Catholic himself, defends his budget by claiming it follows Catholic values and that his interpretation of subsidiarity is consistent with federalism. This moral debate highlights the complex interplay between religion and politics, with Ryan and the Georgetown community holding differing views on the ethical implications of his budget proposals.
END OF SUMMARY.
