Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the letter from Georgetown professors. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, let me read through the article first.

The article talks about how Paul Ryan, a GOP representative, is giving a speech at Georgetown. Before that, some professors sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic doctrine to support his budget. They argue he's misusing the teachings, especially the principle of subsidiarity, to cut government programs that help the poor. Ryan, on the other hand, defends his stance, saying the letter doesn't represent all bishops and that his budget aims to help the poor without increasing government size.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main points: the letter's criticism, Ryan's defense, the moral aspect of using Catholic teachings, and the implications for policy. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Wait, I should also mention the event is still happening despite the criticism. Oh, and Ryan's background with Social Security, maybe that's relevant to show his perspective. 

Let me structure it: start with the criticism from Georgetown, then Ryan's response, his defense of the budget, and the ongoing event. Make sure to highlight the moral framing around the misuse of doctrine.

I think that's the gist. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is facing criticism from Georgetown University professors who accuse him of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify his budget proposals, which they claim harm vulnerable populations. The professors argue that Ryan's invocation of the principle of subsidiarity, a Catholic teaching emphasizing local solutions, is being used to dismantle essential government programs for the poor, elderly, and sick. Ryan, a Catholic, defends his budget as aligning with Catholic social teaching, emphasizing a "preferential option for the poor" while opposing bigger government. The professors counter that subsidiarity does not justify gutting government services and cite the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' opposition to budget cuts affecting the needy. Ryan's upcoming speech at Georgetown remains scheduled, with his team emphasizing his commitment to addressing the debt crisis and helping the poor without expanding government. The debate highlights tensions between Catholic social teachings and fiscal policy. END OF SUMMARY.
