SUMMARY:
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is set to give a speech at Georgetown University, but not before facing criticism from nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school. They accuse Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing budget, which they claim decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The letter argues that Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity" is a misuse of the doctrine, which is not a free pass to dismantle government programs. The writers quote from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, emphasizing that budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan defends his budget, citing a preferential option for the poor, but not necessarily a preferential option for bigger government. END OF SUMMARY.
