SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right." He asserted that too many voices are being unfairly silenced and promised to take action against such censorship. Trump has long criticized these platforms for alleged "shadow banning" and biased algorithms that target conservative accounts while allowing liberal ones to violate rules without consequence. While tech giants deny these allegations, the issue has sparked controversy, with many conservatives feeling their voices are being suppressed. Trump drew a comparison to CNN and MSNBC, stating that despite their "fake" and "sick" behavior, he does not demand their removal. He emphasized the importance of free speech and the right to form one's own opinions, regardless of political affiliation.

END OF SUMMARY.
