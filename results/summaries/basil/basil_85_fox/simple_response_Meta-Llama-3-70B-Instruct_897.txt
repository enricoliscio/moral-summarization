SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump argued that social media sites are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right" while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but stating that he doesn't demand that offending content be taken off air. Trump's comments come amid controversy over alleged censorship by Facebook and Twitter, with conservatives claiming that their accounts are being unfairly restricted. The tech giants have denied bias, attributing any issues to algorithmic glitches or efforts to combat "bad-faith actors" who seek to manipulate conversations. Trump's stance emphasizes the importance of free speech and the dangers of censorship, urging social media platforms to allow all voices to be heard, both good and bad.
