SUMMARY: President Trump has taken a moral stand against social media tech giants, accusing them of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives and silencing their voices. He pledges to take action against this alleged censorship, arguing that it is wrong to deny people their right to free speech and that everyone should be allowed to participate and express their views, regardless of political affiliation. Trump's stance is a response to the controversy surrounding Twitter and Facebook, who have been accused of "shadow banning" and algorithmic biases that disproportionately affect conservative users. While Twitter and Facebook have denied these allegations, claiming that their actions are aimed at maintaining a healthy online environment, Trump and other conservatives see it as a threat to freedom of expression. The President draws a moral line by highlighting the dangers of censorship and the importance of preserving diverse viewpoints, even if they are disagreeable or considered "fake news." He uses the example of CNN and MSNBC, stating that despite their biased content, he does not advocate for their removal. Trump's stance emphasizes the ethical values of free speech, fairness, and tolerance for differing opinions, and raises concerns about the potential abuse of power by social media platforms in determining what content is acceptable.
END OF SUMMARY.
