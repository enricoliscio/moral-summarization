SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and vowing that his administration would not allow it to happen. He argued that the tech giants are "ignoring" rules violations by liberal and left-wing users, while "banning" and "limiting" the visibility of conservative accounts. Trump referred to alleged "shadow banning" as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated after reports of top Republicans' accounts being given limited visibility on Twitter, which the company attributed to an algorithmic glitch. Facebook also faced criticism for "mistreating" pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump condemned censorship as a "dangerous thing" and accused social media sites of "closing down the opinions of many people on the right." He called for an end to the "manipulation" and "detractment" of healthy conversations. END OF SUMMARY.
