SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming they are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right." He promised that his administration would not allow it, stating that too many voices are being unfairly silenced. Trump has long criticized Twitter's alleged "shadow banning" practice and praised his campaign's effective use of Facebook during the 2016 election. The controversy escalated with reports of Twitter's algorithmic glitch limiting visibility for top Republicans and Facebook's mishandling of pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump emphasized the dangers of censorship while also criticizing CNN and MSNBC as "fake news." He asserted his belief in free speech by stating that he does not demand the removal of content he disagrees with.
