SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He alleged that Facebook and Twitter are "ignoring" rules violations by liberal and left-wing users while "banning" and "shadow banning" conservative accounts. Trump referred to the alleged "shadow banning" as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated after Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given "limited" visibility on Twitter. Twitter denied "shadow banning" and claimed it was an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed. Trump accused social media sites of "closing down" opinions of people on the right, while doing nothing to others, and warned that "censorship is a dangerous thing." He also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are "fake," he does not demand that offending content be taken off air. END OF SUMMARY.
