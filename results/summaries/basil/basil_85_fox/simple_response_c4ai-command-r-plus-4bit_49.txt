SUMMARY: President Trump has taken a stand against social media tech giants, accusing them of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives by "shadow banning" their accounts and limiting their visibility. He has characterized this practice as "censorship" and "a dangerous thing," arguing that it silences diverse viewpoints and restricts freedom of expression. 

Trump's concerns echo long-standing complaints from conservatives about alleged discrimination by social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. While Twitter has denied allegations of "shadow banning," acknowledging that it ranks tweets for relevance, it has also admitted to algorithmic glitches that have affected the visibility of certain accounts, including those of prominent Republicans. 

The President, who himself is an avid Twitter user, has vowed that his administration will not tolerate the suppression of conservative voices, equating it to the violation of free speech. He has contrasted this with his own tolerance for liberal news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he criticizes but does not seek to censor, emphasizing his commitment to preserving a plurality of opinions despite his personal disagreements. 

Trump's stance highlights the ethical dilemma surrounding content moderation on social media platforms, raising questions about the boundaries of free speech, the role of tech companies in shaping public discourse, and the potential for bias in their content moderation practices.
