SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media giants Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are censoring their voices and "shadow banning" certain accounts. He argued that these companies are making too many mistakes and that everyone should be allowed to participate regardless of their political views. While Twitter denied the allegations, stating that they do not discriminate based on ideology and only rank tweets for relevance, the controversy escalated when Vice News reported that top Republican accounts were given limited visibility. A Facebook executive also admitted to mistreating pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, further fueling the debate. Trump condemned censorship as a dangerous practice, drawing a parallel with fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he does not demand to be removed despite their "sick behavior." He emphasized that too many voices are being destroyed and that his administration will not tolerate such actions. This issue has sparked ongoing concerns about the alleged discrimination and mishandling of conservative content by tech giants, with many conservatives feeling their voices are being silenced.
