SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media tech giants, including Twitter and Facebook, of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, saying that their voices are being "destroyed" through "shadow banning" and other tactics. He promised to take action against this "discrimination," claiming that it is "illegal." Trump's concerns were echoed by GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who experienced limited visibility on Twitter due to an alleged algorithmic glitch. Twitter denied shadow banning, stating that they only rank tweets for timely relevance and address bad-faith actors. Meanwhile, Facebook also faced accusations of "mistreating" pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, with an executive apologizing for mishandling communications. Trump criticized social media sites for "closing down" right-wing opinions while allowing liberal content, calling censorship a "dangerous thing." He drew a comparison with CNN and MSNBC, stating that despite their "fake" and "sick" behavior, he does not demand their removal. Trump emphasized the importance of free speech and allowing all voices to participate, regardless of political affiliation.
END OF SUMMARY.
