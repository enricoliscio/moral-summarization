SUMMARY: President Trump has taken a stand against social media tech giants, accusing them of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives. He asserts that these companies are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right," while allowing those on the left to continue spreading their messages unimpeded. This controversy has been ongoing for years, with conservatives claiming that their voices are being silenced through "shadow banning" and other tactics. While Twitter and Facebook have denied these allegations, providing explanations for their actions and even apologizing in some cases, the issue escalated when Vice News reported on the apparent bias. Trump, a frequent Twitter user whose campaign effectively utilized Facebook, pledges to not allow this "censorship" to continue, calling it "a dangerous thing." He draws a moral line by emphasizing free speech and the right to express one's views, regardless of political affiliation, and further demonstrates his commitment to this principle by not demanding the removal of content from liberal news outlets he deems "fake," instead choosing to tolerate or ignore it.

END OF SUMMARY.
