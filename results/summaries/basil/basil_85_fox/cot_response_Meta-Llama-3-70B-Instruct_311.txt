SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump argued that "bad" and "fake" content should be allowed to exist, saying "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" He also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" and saying that while their content is "sick," he does not demand that it be removed. Trump's criticism comes amid allegations that Facebook and Twitter have been censoring conservative accounts while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. The tech giants have denied any bias, with Twitter saying it does not "shadow ban" based on political viewpoints or ideology. END OF SUMMARY.
