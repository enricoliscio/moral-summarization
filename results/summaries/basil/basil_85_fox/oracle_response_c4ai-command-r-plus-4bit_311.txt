SUMMARY: President Trump has accused social media giants Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are destroying voices and engaging in censorship. He promised to take action against such discriminatory practices, stating that everyone should be allowed to participate regardless of political viewpoint. The controversy escalated when Vice News reported that top Republican accounts were being given limited visibility, with Twitter attributing it to an algorithmic glitch. Twitter and Facebook have denied shadow banning users based on ideology, but conservatives have long complained of discrimination. A Facebook executive recently apologized for mishandling communications with pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, who have claimed censorship. Trump accused social media sites of silencing right-wing voices while turning a blind eye to liberal and left-wing users, calling censorship a dangerous practice that cannot be tolerated. He contrasted this with his own tolerance of fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he chooses to ignore rather than demand their removal. Trump's administration is taking a stand against what they see as the illegal and destructive behavior of social media platforms.
END OF SUMMARY.
