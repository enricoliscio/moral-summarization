SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump argued that social media sites are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right" while doing nothing to others. He called censorship "a dangerous thing" and criticized CNN and MSNBC for their "fake" content, but noted that he doesn't demand their removal. Trump's comments come amid allegations of "shadow banning" and censorship by Twitter and Facebook, which both companies have denied. Conservatives have long complained of discrimination by tech giants, and the controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republicans' accounts were being given limited visibility on Twitter.
