Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about President Trump criticizing social media giants like Facebook and Twitter for allegedly discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims that too many voices are being suppressed and that his administration won't allow it. He mentions that these platforms are making choices that lead to mistakes, and he wants everyone, good or bad, to participate.

The article also mentions that both Facebook and Twitter have been accused of censoring accounts, especially conservative ones, while ignoring rule violations by liberal users. Trump has previously called Twitter's actions "discriminatory and illegal." He uses Twitter daily and his campaign used Facebook effectively in 2016.

Conservatives have been complaining about discrimination by tech giants for years. The controversy escalated when Vice News reported that top Republicans, including Ronna McDaniel, had limited visibility on Twitter, which Twitter attributed to an algorithmic glitch that was fixed. They denied shadow banning based on political views.

Facebook apologized for mishandling Diamond and Silk's accounts but denied bias against conservatives. Trump accused social media sites of closing down opinions on the right while ignoring others. He called censorship dangerous and criticized CNN and MSNBC as fake news, though he doesn't demand their content be removed.

I need to capture the key points: Trump's accusation of discrimination, the platforms' responses, the escalation of the issue, and Trump's broader criticism of media bias. The moral framing is about free speech, fairness, and the role of social media in shaping public opinion. I should ensure the summary reflects Trump's concern about suppression of conservative voices and the platforms' denials.

Let me structure the summary to include Trump's main points, the platforms' responses, and the context of the controversy. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

I'll start by stating Trump's accusation, mention the platforms involved, their denials, the examples like Ronna McDaniel and Diamond and Silk, Trump's stance on censorship, and his criticism of media bias. I'll end with the implication of the debate on free speech and media influence.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear. Also, make sure to include the moral aspects, such as fairness and suppression of voices.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all necessary points while preserving the author's moral framing.
