SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook for allegedly discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He has accused them of "shadow banning" and censoring accounts with right-wing views while turning a blind eye to rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. While Twitter has denied shadow banning and attributed the issue to an algorithmic glitch, Facebook has also been accused of mistreating pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump has vowed that his administration will not allow the silencing of conservative voices, calling censorship a "dangerous thing." He has contrasted this with his own tolerance of liberal media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he considers "fake news," but does not seek to have removed. The controversy surrounding social media platforms' treatment of conservative voices has escalated in recent months, with many conservatives claiming long-standing discrimination.
