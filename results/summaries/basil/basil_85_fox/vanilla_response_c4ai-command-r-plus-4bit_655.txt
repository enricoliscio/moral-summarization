SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants like Twitter and Facebook of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right." He argued that "too many voices are being destroyed," promising to take action against such censorship. Trump referenced reports of algorithmic bias and "shadow banning" by Twitter and the alleged mistreatment of pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk by Facebook. While social media platforms deny biased censorship, Trump insisted that the censorship of conservative voices is a "dangerous thing." He contrasted this with his tolerance for liberal news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, stating that he does not demand their content be removed despite disagreeing with their viewpoints. Trump's comments reflect a growing concern among conservatives about alleged discrimination by tech companies and the perceived need to protect free speech and diversity of opinion online.
