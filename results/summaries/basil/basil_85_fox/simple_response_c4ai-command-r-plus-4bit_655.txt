SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants Facebook and Twitter of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right." He promised to take action against this perceived censorship, calling it a "dangerous thing." Trump's concerns are shared by many conservatives who feel their voices are being silenced by these platforms. While Twitter has denied allegations of "shadow banning," admitting only to ranking tweets for "timely relevance," the controversy escalated when Vice News reported that accounts of top Republicans were given limited visibility. A Facebook executive also apologized for mistreating pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, but Trump argues this does little to address the larger issue of censorship. The President draws a moral line when he affirms that he does not demand the censorship of fake news channels like CNN and MSNBC, despite their "sick behavior." He concludes by stating that everyone should be allowed to participate, good and bad, and that it is up to the public to discern truth from falsehood.
END OF SUMMARY.
