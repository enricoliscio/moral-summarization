SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He tweeted that "who is making the choices" and that "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" Trump's comments come after allegations of censorship by Facebook and Twitter, with conservatives claiming that their accounts are being limited in visibility. Both platforms have denied bias, with Twitter stating that it does not "shadow ban" and Facebook apologizing for mistreating pro-Trump personalities. Trump also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but saying he doesn't demand that their content be removed. The controversy has been escalating, with Trump's campaign credited for its use of social media in securing its 2016 victory.

END OF SUMMARY.
