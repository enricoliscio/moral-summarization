SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media tech giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are "destroying too many voices". He promised to take action against this alleged discrimination and demanded that all voices, "good and bad", be allowed to participate and be heard. Trump's remarks come amid an ongoing controversy where Facebook and Twitter have been accused of "censoring" conservative accounts while turning a blind eye to rule violations by liberals and left-wing users. Twitter denied "shadow banning" and attributed the issue to an algorithmic glitch, but conservatives remain skeptical. A Facebook executive apologized for mistreating pro-Trump personalities, Diamond and Silk, but the company has denied bias. Trump's administration is taking a stand against what he calls "censorship", a "dangerous" act, while also taking a swipe at "fake" news networks CNN and MSNBC, stating that he does not demand their "offending" content be removed. Trump asserts his commitment to free speech, stating that everyone should be allowed to participate and that it is up to the people to "figure it out". END OF SUMMARY.
