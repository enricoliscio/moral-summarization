SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump alleged that Twitter and Facebook are "censoring" accounts and ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. He called censorship a "dangerous thing" and took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, labeling them "fake" and their behavior as "sick". Trump argued that while he doesn't demand that offending content be taken off air, social media sites are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right". The controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported the issue, and Twitter and Facebook have since denied any bias against conservatives. Trump's administration is promising to take action to prevent the alleged "discrimination" and "censorship". END OF SUMMARY.
