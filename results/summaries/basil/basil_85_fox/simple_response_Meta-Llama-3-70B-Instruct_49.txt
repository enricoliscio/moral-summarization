SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump argued that social media platforms are censoring accounts and ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users, while allowing "bad-faith actors" to manipulate conversations. He tweeted that censorship is "a dangerous thing" and that everyone, both good and bad, should be allowed to participate. Trump's comments come amid allegations of "shadow banning" by Twitter and Facebook, which both companies have denied. The controversy has escalated in recent weeks, with top Republicans claiming they are being censored on Twitter and Facebook apologizing for mistreating pro-Trump personalities. Trump's remarks have sparked debate about the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the balance between free speech and regulating harmful content.
