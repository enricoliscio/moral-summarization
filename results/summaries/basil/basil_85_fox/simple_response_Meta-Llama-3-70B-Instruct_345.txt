SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He argued that both Facebook and Twitter have been censoring accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. Trump's criticism comes after reports of alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter, which the company denies. The President's concerns are rooted in the idea that social media platforms are stifling free speech and promoting a biased narrative. He believes that all voices, both good and bad, should be allowed to participate in online discourse, rather than being silenced by the tech giants. Trump's stance is rooted in a moral imperative to protect free speech and promote a fair and open online environment.
