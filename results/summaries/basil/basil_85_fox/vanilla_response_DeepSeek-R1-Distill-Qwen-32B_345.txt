Alright, so I need to help summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump criticizing social media companies for discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims that too many voices are being suppressed and that his administration won't allow it. He mentions that decisions on content are being made without transparency and that both good and bad voices should be allowed to participate.

The article also talks about specific instances where Facebook and Twitter have been accused of censorship. Facebook apologized for mishandling communications with pro-Trump personalities like Diamond and Silk, but they denied being biased. Twitter addressed the issue by explaining that it was an algorithmic glitch and that they don't shadow ban based on political views. They do, however, rank tweets for relevance and address manipulative actors.

Trump has a history of using Twitter and Facebook effectively, especially in his 2016 campaign. He's been critical of these platforms for what he perceives as unfair treatment towards conservatives. The controversy escalated when Vice News reported that Republican accounts were being limited, which Twitter later fixed.

In the summary, I should include Trump's main points: his accusation of discrimination, the response from social media companies, and the context of their past actions. I also need to mention his comparison to media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, where he accuses them of being fake news but doesn't demand their content be removed.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all the key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first stating Trump's criticism, then the companies' responses, and finally his broader comments on media bias. I'll avoid including too much background information to keep it brief.
