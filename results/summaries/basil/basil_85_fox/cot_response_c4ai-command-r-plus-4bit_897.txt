SUMMARY: 
President Trump accused social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are "destroying" voices on the right through "censorship." He pledged to take action against this "dangerous" practice, calling out their alleged "mistakes" and "discriminatory" behavior. While tech giants have denied any bias, Trump and other conservatives have long accused them of "shadow banning" and allowing "bad-faith" liberal and left-wing users to violate rules without consequence. A recent controversy involving GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's limited visibility on Twitter fueled these accusations. Despite Trump's reliance on Twitter and his campaign's successful use of Facebook, he believes social media sites are "closing down" conservative opinions while letting liberal "fake news" and "offending" content thrive. Trump also criticized Facebook for "mishandling" communications with pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, illustrating his belief in the biased treatment of conservatives by these platforms. Trump vowed to address this issue, seeing it as a threat to free speech and fair participation in the digital arena.
