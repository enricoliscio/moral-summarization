SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants, particularly Facebook and Twitter, of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, stating that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump claimed that the tech giants are censoring accounts and ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. He tweeted that "censorship is a dangerous thing" and that everyone should be allowed to participate, regardless of their views. This controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter and Facebook have denied allegations of bias, citing algorithmic glitches and efforts to promote healthy conversation. Trump also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but stating that he doesn't demand their removal.

END OF SUMMARY.
