SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He alleged that the tech giants are "ignoring" rules violations by liberal and left-wing users, while "banning" and "shadow banning" conservative accounts. Trump referred to the alleged "shadow banning" as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated after Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given "limited" visibility on Twitter. Twitter denied "shadow banning" and claimed it was an algorithmic glitch, but Trump accused the platform of "manipulating" and "detracting" from healthy conversations. Facebook also faced criticism, with an executive apologizing for "mistreating" pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump warned that censorship is a "dangerous thing" and that "closing down" opinions on the right cannot be allowed to happen. END OF SUMMARY.
