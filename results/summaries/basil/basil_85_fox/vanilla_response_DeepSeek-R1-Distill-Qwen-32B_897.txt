Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's criticism of social media companies. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

So, Trump is accusing tech giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He's saying that too many voices are being suppressed and that his administration won't allow that. He mentions that decisions are being made by these companies, which are making too many mistakes. He wants everyone, both good and bad, to participate and let people figure it out themselves.

The article also mentions that both Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring accounts, especially conservative ones. There's been controversy over shadow banning, which Trump has called discriminatory and illegal. He uses Twitter a lot, and his campaign used Facebook effectively in 2016.

Conservatives have been complaining about discrimination for years, but it escalated when Vice News reported that Republican accounts, including Ronna McDaniel's, were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter responded by saying it was a glitch and that they don't shadow ban based on political views. They explained that they rank tweets for relevance and address bad actors manipulating conversations.

Facebook apologized for mishandling communications with Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump personalities who felt censored. Despite this, the controversy continues. Trump accused the platforms of closing down opinions on the right while ignoring others. He called censorship dangerous and criticized CNN and MSNBC as fake news, yet he doesn't demand their content be removed.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on Trump's accusations, the companies' responses, and the broader context of the controversy. I should make sure to include key points like the algorithmic glitch, the denial of bias, and Trump's comparison to media outlets.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Trump's accusation, mention the companies involved, their responses, the examples like McDaniel and Diamond and Silk, and Trump's broader comments about censorship and media bias. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, moving from Trump's statements to the companies' responses and the ongoing controversy.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. Make sure each point is covered succinctly. Maybe combine some sentences to save space. For example, instead of listing each point separately, find a way to mention them together.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within 200 words and covers all the essential elements without being too verbose.
