SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants, particularly Facebook and Twitter, of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He tweeted that the platforms are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right" while doing nothing to others. Trump has previously referred to alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter and Facebook have denied allegations of bias, attributing the issue to algorithmic glitches and ranking models. Trump also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but saying he doesn't demand that offending content be taken off air.

END OF SUMMARY.
