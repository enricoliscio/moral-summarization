Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. So, first, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about President Trump criticizing social media giants like Facebook and Twitter for allegedly discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims that too many voices are being silenced and that his administration won't allow it. The tech companies have denied these allegations, explaining that their algorithms are neutral and aimed at relevance, not bias. However, conservatives, including Trump, continue to accuse them of unfair treatment, leading to ongoing controversy.

I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's accusations, the companies' responses, and the context of the issue. It's important to include that Trump uses these platforms extensively and that his campaign benefited from them in 2016. Also, the mention of specific incidents, like the Vice News report and the Diamond and Silk case, adds depth to the summary.

I should structure the summary to first present Trump's accusations, then the companies' defenses, and finally the ongoing controversy. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, is crucial. I also need to maintain the moral framing, highlighting the tension between free speech and content moderation.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article. Making sure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's statements, moving to the companies' responses, and ending with the implications and the broader debate.

I should also check for any key phrases or quotes that encapsulate the moral arguments, like Trump calling censorship "dangerous" and comparing it to media outlets he deems fake. Including these will help preserve the moral framing as intended.

Finally, I need to ensure the summary is clear and within the word limit, ending with the specified tokens. I'll draft it, then review to make sure it's accurate and meets all the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: President Trump has accused social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed." He criticized the platforms for allegedly censoring conservative accounts while overlooking rule violations by liberal users. Trump, a frequent user of Twitter, has long accused the platform of "shadow banning" conservatives, which he deems "discriminatory and illegal." Both Facebook and Twitter have denied these allegations, stating that their algorithms are neutral and aimed at relevance, not bias. However, conservatives continue to argue that the tech companies are unfairly targeting them. The controversy escalated after reports of limited visibility for top Republican accounts, though Twitter attributed this to a technical glitch. Facebook recently apologized for mishandling communication with pro-Trump personalities like Diamond and Silk but denied bias. Trump accused the platforms of silencing right-wing opinions while sparing others, calling censorship "a dangerous thing." He also criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake," yet he does not demand their content be removed. The debate highlights tensions over free speech, content moderation, and political bias in the digital age. END OF SUMMARY.
