Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points and identify the key moral terms.

The article talks about President Trump accusing social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He mentions that too many voices are being destroyed, implying a suppression of free speech. The author uses words like "discriminating," "destroyed," "ignoring," "banning," "discriminatory," "illegal," "discrimination," "limited," "ban," "manipulate," "detract," "mistreating," and "closing." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's accusations, the companies' responses, and the ongoing controversy. It's important to maintain the moral tone by using those specific terms. I'll start by stating Trump's accusation, then mention the companies' refutations, and finally touch on the broader implications, such as the comparison to media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered without losing the moral framing. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and adjust as necessary.

Finally, I'll make sure to use the specified tokens "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." to enclose the summary as per the user's instructions. This should meet all the requirements and provide a clear, morally framed summary of the article.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming "too many voices are being destroyed." He criticized the platforms for "ignoring" rules violations by liberal users while "closing down" conservative opinions. Trump described this as "discriminatory and illegal," referencing alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter. Both platforms denied bias, with Twitter attributing issues to algorithmic glitches and emphasizing that it does not "shadow ban" based on political views. Facebook apologized for "mistreating" pro-Trump personalities but denied bias. Trump also criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" while not demanding their content be removed. The controversy highlights concerns over "manipulation," "detracting" from healthy conversations, and the "dangerous" impact of censorship. END OF SUMMARY.
