Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump criticizing social media companies. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump accused tech giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He mentioned that too many voices are being destroyed and that his administration won't allow it. He also questioned who's making the choices, implying that mistakes are being made.

Then, it talks about how both Facebook and Twitter have been accused of censoring accounts, especially conservative ones, while not enforcing rules on liberal users. Trump has previously called Twitter's "shadow banning" discriminatory and illegal. He uses Twitter daily, and his campaign used Facebook effectively in 2016.

Conservatives have been complaining about discrimination by these tech companies for years. The controversy got worse when Vice News reported that top Republicans, including Ronna McDaniel, were having their tweets limited on Twitter. Twitter responded, saying it was a glitch and that they don't shadow ban based on political views. They explained that they rank tweets for relevance and address manipulative actors.

Facebook also apologized for mishandling their communication with Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump personalities who claimed they were censored. However, Facebook denied bias against conservatives. Trump then accused social media sites of closing down opinions on the right while ignoring others. He said too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad, and that it can't be allowed.

He also criticized CNN and MSNBC as fake news, yet he doesn't demand their content be removed. He suggested people watch them with a grain of salt or not at all.

So, the key points are:
1. Trump accuses social media of discriminating against conservatives.
2. Twitter and Facebook deny shadow banning or bias.
3. Controversy over limited visibility for Republican accounts.
4. Trump's criticism of media bias and fake news.
5. His administration's stance against censorship.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should mention Trump's accusations, the companies' responses, the examples like Ronna McDaniel and Diamond and Silk, and his comments on media bias. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it step by step:
- Trump criticizes social media for discriminating against conservatives.
- Companies deny shadow banning and explain their algorithms.
- Examples of controversies with specific accounts.
- Trump's broader criticism of media bias and fake news.
- His stance on not allowing censorship.

I should make sure each point is clear and the summary flows logically.
