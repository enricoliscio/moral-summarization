SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. Trump tweeted that "censorship is a dangerous thing" and that social media sites are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right." He alleged that Facebook and Twitter are "shadow banning" conservative accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. Trump's criticism comes despite Twitter's denial of "shadow banning" and Facebook's apology for mistreating pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" and saying that he doesn't demand that their "sick behavior" be removed. END OF SUMMARY.
