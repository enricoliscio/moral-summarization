SUMMARY: 
President Trump accused social media giants Facebook and Twitter of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are "destroying" too many voices. He promised to take action against this "dangerous" censorship, stating that everyone should be allowed to "participate", regardless of their political views. While Twitter denied allegations of "shadow banning" and justified their ranking models as a way to address "bad-faith actors", Facebook admitted to mishandling communications with pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, apologizing for their treatment. Trump drew a moral line by stating that, despite finding CNN and MSNBC "fake" and their behavior "sick", he does not demand their removal. He argued that censorship is unacceptable and that people should be allowed to form their own opinions, even if it means having to "watch with a grain of salt". Trump's stance highlights the importance of free speech and the right to express one's views without fear of being "weeded out" or silenced.
