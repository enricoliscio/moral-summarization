SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He tweeted that social media sites are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right" while doing nothing to others. Trump has previously referred to alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republicans' accounts were being given limited visibility on Twitter, which Twitter attributed to an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed. Facebook has also faced accusations of bias, with an executive apologizing for mistreating pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump called censorship "a dangerous thing" and took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are "fake," he does not demand that offending content be taken off air.

END OF SUMMARY.
