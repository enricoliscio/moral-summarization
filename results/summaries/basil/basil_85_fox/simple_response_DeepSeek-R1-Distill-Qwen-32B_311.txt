Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump accusing social media companies like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims too many voices are being suppressed and vows his administration won't allow it. 

I notice the article mentions specific incidents, like the Vice News report on limited visibility for Republican accounts and Twitter's response about algorithmic glitches. Facebook's apology for mishandling Diamond and Silk's accounts is also noted. Trump criticizes these companies for closing down opinions on the right while ignoring others. He also takes a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them fake news but not demanding their content be removed.

I should make sure the summary captures Trump's accusations, the companies' responses, and the broader context of the controversy. The moral framing here is about fairness and suppression of voices, so I'll highlight that. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating Trump's main accusation, mention the companies involved, their responses, and conclude with his criticism of media bias. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming "too many voices are being destroyed." He criticized the platforms for allegedly suppressing conservative content while ignoring rule violations by liberal users. Trump, who frequently uses Twitter, has previously called Twitter's alleged "shadow banning" of conservatives "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated after reports that Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were given limited visibility on Twitter, which the company attributed to an algorithmic glitch. Twitter denied shadow banning based on political views, stating it ranks tweets for relevance and addresses bad-faith actors. Facebook also faced criticism for mishandling accounts of pro-Trump personalities, though it denied bias. Trump accused the platforms of silencing right-wing opinions while ignoring others, calling censorship "a dangerous thing." He criticized CNN and MSNBC as "fake news" but said he does not demand their content be removed. END OF SUMMARY.
