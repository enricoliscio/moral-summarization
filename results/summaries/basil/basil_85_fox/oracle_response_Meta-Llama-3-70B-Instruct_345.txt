SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He argued that the tech giants are "ignoring" rules violations by liberal and left-wing users while "banning" and "shadow banning" conservative accounts. Trump referred to this alleged practice as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given "limited visibility" on Twitter. Twitter denied "shadow banning" based on political viewpoints, but Trump remains skeptical. He also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but saying he doesn't demand their removal. Trump warned that "censorship is a dangerous thing" and that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen." END OF SUMMARY.
