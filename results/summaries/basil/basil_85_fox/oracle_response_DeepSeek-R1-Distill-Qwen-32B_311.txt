Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is accusing social media companies like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He uses terms like "discriminating," "destroyed," and "banning." The article mentions specific incidents, like the Vice News report on Twitter limiting visibility for Republican accounts, which Twitter claimed was a glitch. Facebook also had issues with personalities like Diamond and Silk feeling mistreated.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words. I'll start by stating Trump's accusation, using "discriminating" and "destroyed." Then, I'll mention the companies' denials, using "illegal" and "discrimination." I'll include the examples of Twitter's glitch and Facebook's apology, using "mistreating." 

I should also note Trump's comparison with media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, using "fake" and "closing." I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. I'll structure it to highlight the conflict, the companies' responses, and Trump's stance on media bias.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral language. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming "too many voices are being destroyed." He criticized platforms like Twitter and Facebook for allegedly "ignoring" rules violations by liberals while "closing down" conservative opinions. Trump referred to Twitter's "shadow banning" as "discriminatory and illegal," though the company denied such claims, stating it does not "ban" based on political views but rather "ranks" content for relevance. Facebook also denied bias, apologizing for "mistreating" pro-Trump personalities like Diamond and Silk. Trump condemned censorship as "dangerous" and criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for being "fake," yet he does not demand their content be removed. The controversy highlights concerns over "manipulation" and "detracting" from healthy discourse, with both sides accusing the other of unfair treatment. END OF SUMMARY.
