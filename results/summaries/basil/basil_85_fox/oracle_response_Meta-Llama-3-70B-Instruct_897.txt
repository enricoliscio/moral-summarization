SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He alleged that Twitter and Facebook are "closing down the opinions of many people on the right" while "ignoring" rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. Trump referred to the alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated after reports of top Republicans' accounts being given "limited visibility" on Twitter, which the company attributed to an "algorithmic glitch" that has since been fixed. Trump also took aim at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but stating that he does not demand that offending content be taken off air. The president warned that censorship is "a dangerous thing" and that "bad-faith actors" are trying to "manipulate or detract from healthy conversation."

END OF SUMMARY.
