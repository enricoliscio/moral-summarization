SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He argued that "bad" and "good" voices should be allowed to participate, and that it's up to individuals to "figure it out." Trump has previously referred to alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated last month when top Republicans, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, claimed their accounts were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Trump called censorship "a dangerous thing" and took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying they are "fake" but he doesn't demand that their content be removed. He emphasized that he can "get used to it" and watch with a "grain of salt." END OF SUMMARY.
