Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments on social media giants. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Trump accused social media companies like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He mentioned that too many voices are being destroyed and promised his administration wouldn't allow that. He talked about who's making the choices and emphasized letting everyone participate, both good and bad.

Then, it mentions that both Facebook and Twitter have been criticized for allegedly censoring accounts, especially ignoring rule violations by liberal users. Trump has previously called Twitter's shadow banning as discriminatory and illegal. He uses Twitter daily, and his campaign used Facebook effectively in 2016.

Conservatives have been complaining about discrimination by tech giants for years. The controversy got worse when Vice News reported that top Republicans, including Ronna McDaniel, had limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter responded, saying it was an algorithmic glitch and that they don't shadow ban based on political views. They explained that they rank tweets for relevance and address bad-faith actors.

Facebook apologized for mishandling Diamond and Silk's case, but they denied bias against conservatives. Trump accused social media sites of closing down right-wing opinions while ignoring others. He called censorship dangerous and criticized CNN and MSNBC as fake news, yet he doesn't demand their content be removed.

So, the main points are: Trump accuses social media of discriminating against conservatives, claims of censorship and shadow banning, tech companies' responses, and the ongoing controversy. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include Trump's accusations, the companies involved, their responses, and the context of the controversy. Also, mention his criticism of media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's accusations, mention the companies, their denials, examples like Ronna McDaniel and Diamond and Silk, and his broader criticism of media bias. Keep it concise, ensuring each key point is covered without getting too detailed.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, keeping it within the word limit and the required structure.
