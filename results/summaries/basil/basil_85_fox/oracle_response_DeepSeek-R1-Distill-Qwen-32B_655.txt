Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump accusing social media giants like Twitter and Facebook of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He's upset because he believes these platforms are limiting conservative voices, which he refers to as "destroyed." The article mentions specific instances like the Vice News report and Twitter's algorithm glitch.

I should note the key morally framed words: discriminating, destroyed, ignoring, banning, discriminatory, illegal, discrimination, limited, ban, manipulate, detract, mistreating, closing. I need to incorporate these into the summary without making it sound forced.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include Trump's accusations, the platforms' responses, and the ongoing controversy. I'll mention the terms like "discriminatory," "destroyed," and "closing down opinions" to highlight the moral issues he's pointing out.

I also need to include the platforms' refutations, like Twitter denying shadow banning and Facebook apologizing for mishandling Diamond and Silk. But since the user wants to preserve the moral framing, I'll focus more on Trump's perspective and the negative terms he uses.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary stays under 200 words, keeping it concise but comprehensive. I'll make sure to include all the key points and the moral language to reflect the article's framing accurately.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants like Twitter and Facebook of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming "too many voices are being destroyed." He criticized the platforms for "closing down the opinions of many people on the right," while allegedly ignoring rules violations by liberal users. Trump referred to Twitter's "shadow banning" as "discriminatory and illegal," though the company denied these allegations, stating it does not "shadow ban" based on political views. Facebook also faced criticism for "mistreating" pro-Trump personalities like Diamond and Silk, though it apologized for mishandling communications. Trump warned against censorship, calling it "a dangerous thing," while criticizing media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for spreading "fake news." The controversy escalated after reports of limited visibility for GOP accounts, with Twitter attributing issues to algorithmic glitches. Trump emphasized that both "good & bad" voices should be allowed to participate, but accused the platforms of manipulating and deterring healthy conversations. END OF SUMMARY.
