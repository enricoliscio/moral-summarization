SUMMARY:

President Trump has accused social media giants, particularly Facebook and Twitter, of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims that "too many voices are being destroyed" and has promised that his administration will not allow it to happen. Trump has referred to alleged "shadow banning" by Twitter as "discriminatory and illegal." The controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter and Facebook have denied allegations of bias, citing algorithmic glitches and efforts to promote "timely relevance" and combat "bad-faith actors." Trump has also taken a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but saying he doesn't demand that offending content be removed.

END OF SUMMARY.
