Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump criticizing social media companies. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump accused tech giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He mentioned that too many voices are being destroyed and promised his administration wouldn't allow it. He talked about who makes the choices and emphasized letting everyone participate, both good and bad.

Then, it mentions that both Facebook and Twitter have been accused of censoring accounts and ignoring rule violations by liberal users. Trump has previously criticized Twitter's "shadow banning" as discriminatory. He uses Twitter daily and his campaign used Facebook effectively in 2016.

Conservatives have been complaining about discrimination for years, but the issue escalated when Vice News reported that Republican accounts, including Ronna McDaniel's, were being limited on Twitter. Twitter responded, saying it was an algorithmic glitch and they don't shadow ban based on political views. They explained they rank tweets for relevance and address manipulative actors.

Facebook apologized for mishandling Diamond and Silk's case but denied bias against conservatives. Trump accused social media of silencing right-wing opinions while ignoring others. He called censorship dangerous and criticized CNN and MSNBC as fake news, though he doesn't demand their content be removed.

So, the key points are:
1. Trump accuses social media of discriminating against conservatives.
2. Twitter and Facebook deny shadow banning or bias.
3. Examples include limited visibility for Republican accounts and mishandling of pro-Trump personalities.
4. Trump criticizes media bias, comparing it to social media censorship.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's accusations, mention the companies' denials, provide examples, and include his criticism of the media. I should keep it concise and clear, making sure to cover all main points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it step by step:
- Trump accuses social media of discriminating against conservatives.
- Companies deny shadow banning or bias.
- Examples: Twitter glitch, Facebook's handling of Diamond and Silk.
- Trump criticizes media bias, comparing it to social media actions.

Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.
