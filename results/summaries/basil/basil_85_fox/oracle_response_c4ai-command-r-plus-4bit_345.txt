SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that they are destroying too many voices and engaging in censorship. He vowed that his administration would not tolerate such actions. While Twitter has denied allegations of "shadow banning" and Facebook has apologized to pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk for mishandling their accounts, Trump maintains that social media sites are closing down the opinions of right-wing users while turning a blind eye to liberal and left-wing violations. The President highlighted the issue of censorship, calling it a dangerous practice, but also asserted that he does not support removing content, even from fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC. Trump's criticism comes as no surprise, given his own frequent use of Twitter and his campaign's successful utilization of Facebook in the 2016 election. The controversy surrounding alleged discrimination by tech giants has escalated, with many conservatives feeling their voices are being limited and manipulated, while others argue that tech companies are simply trying to address bad-faith actors and promote healthy online discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
