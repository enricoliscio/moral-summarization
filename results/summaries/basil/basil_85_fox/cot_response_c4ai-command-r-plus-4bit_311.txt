SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, saying that their voices are being "destroyed." He promised to take action against this "discrimination," referring to it as "shadow banning" and "illegal." Trump's concerns about censorship and bias align with long-standing complaints from conservatives, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who experienced limited visibility on Twitter due to an alleged "algorithmic glitch." While social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have denied allegations of bias, with Twitter stating they "do not shadow ban," Trump and other Republicans remain critical of their practices. The President emphasized the importance of free expression, even for "bad" voices, drawing a moral line by calling censorship a "dangerous" act. He also took a moral stance against "fake" news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, stating that despite their "sick behavior," he does not advocate for their removal. Trump's stance highlights his commitment to free speech and his belief in individual discernment over censorship. END OF SUMMARY.
