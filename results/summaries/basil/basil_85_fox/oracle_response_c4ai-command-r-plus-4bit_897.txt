SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized social media companies for their alleged discrimination against Republicans and conservatives, arguing that it is wrong to destroy voices and limit visibility. He has accused Twitter and Facebook of banning and censoring accounts with right-wing views, while turning a blind eye to violations by liberal users. Despite his daily use of Twitter and his campaign's successful utilization of Facebook, Trump believes that these platforms are engaging in "shadow banning" and other discriminatory practices that may be illegal. Twitter has denied these claims, attributing the issue to an algorithmic glitch. Meanwhile, Facebook has admitted to mishandling communications with pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, but denies biased treatment of conservatives. Trump maintains that social media sites are silencing right-wing voices while allowing left-leaning content to remain, and he warns that censorship is a dangerous path to follow. He draws a comparison to fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he chooses to tolerate despite their offensive content.
