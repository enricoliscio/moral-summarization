Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump criticizing social media companies like Facebook and Twitter for discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims too many voices are being destroyed and that his administration won't allow it. The companies have denied these allegations, saying it's an algorithmic glitch or that they're just ranking content. Trump also mentions that while these platforms are closing down opinions on the right, they're ignoring issues on the left. He criticizes CNN and MSNBC as fake news but doesn't demand their removal, which he contrasts with his stance on social media.

I need to make sure to include words like "discriminating," "destroyed," "ignoring," "banning," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of these terms as possible. I'll structure it to first state Trump's accusations, then the companies' responses, and finally his broader criticism of media bias.

Let me start drafting: Trump accuses tech giants of discriminating against conservatives, destroying their voices. Companies deny, citing algorithms. Controversy over shadow banning and limited visibility. Trump compares to media bias, calling censorship dangerous and highlighting the double standard.

Wait, I need to make sure to include all the key points and the moral words without making it too long. Maybe mention the algorithmic glitch and the companies' statements about not shadow banning. Also, include the part where Trump contrasts this with media like CNN and MSNBC, which he considers fake but doesn't demand their removal.

Putting it all together, ensuring the summary flows and includes the moral framing words. Let me check the word count to make sure it's under 200.
