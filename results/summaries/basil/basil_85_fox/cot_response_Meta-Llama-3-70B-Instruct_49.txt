SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media giants of "discriminating" against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He argued that "bad" and "good" voices should be allowed to participate, and that censorship is a "dangerous thing". Trump also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" and saying that while he doesn't demand that offending content be taken off air, he takes their reporting with a "grain of salt". The controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported that top Republicans' accounts were being given limited visibility on Twitter, which Twitter attributed to an algorithmic glitch. Facebook has also faced allegations of bias, with an executive apologizing for mistreating pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump's criticism of social media censorship has sparked a heated debate about the role of tech giants in shaping public discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
