SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives by censoring their accounts and limiting their visibility. He vowed to take action against this alleged discrimination, claiming that too many voices are being unfairly silenced. Trump's concerns echo long-standing complaints from conservatives about bias and censorship by tech companies, despite denials and apologies from the platforms. The controversy intensified following reports of "shadow banning" and algorithmic glitches that disproportionately affected conservative accounts. Trump emphasized the importance of free speech, comparing the situation to his tolerance for "fake news" channels like CNN and MSNBC, which he chooses to either watch with skepticism or ignore entirely. He asserted that censorship is dangerous and that all voices, regardless of their political affiliation or content, should be allowed to participate in online discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
