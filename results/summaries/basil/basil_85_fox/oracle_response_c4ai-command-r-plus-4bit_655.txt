SUMMARY: President Trump has taken aim at social media tech giants for their alleged discrimination against Republicans and conservatives, accusing them of destroying voices and engaging in censorship. He promised that his administration would not allow such actions to continue. Trump's comments come amid ongoing controversy over social media platforms' treatment of conservative accounts, with both Facebook and Twitter facing accusations of censoring and limiting visibility for right-leaning users while turning a blind eye to rules violations by liberals and left-wing users. Twitter has denied shadow banning and attributed the issue to an algorithmic glitch, while Facebook has apologized for mishandling communications with prominent pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk. Trump criticized social media sites for closing down right-wing opinions while allowing left-leaning "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC to continue operating. He called censorship a dangerous practice and emphasized his belief in allowing all voices to be heard, regardless of their political affiliation or content. Trump's stance highlights the ongoing debate surrounding free speech, bias, and the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse.
