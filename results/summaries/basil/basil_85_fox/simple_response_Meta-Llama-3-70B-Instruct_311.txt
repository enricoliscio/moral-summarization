SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media giants of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, claiming that "too many voices are being destroyed" and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen. He argued that both Facebook and Twitter have been censoring accounts and ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. Trump's criticism comes after Vice News reported that top Republican accounts, including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter denied the allegations, saying it was an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed. Trump emphasized that censorship is a "dangerous thing" and that all voices, both good and bad, should be allowed to participate. He also took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake" but not demanding that their content be removed.

END OF SUMMARY.
