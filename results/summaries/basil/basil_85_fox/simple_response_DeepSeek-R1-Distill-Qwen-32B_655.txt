Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about President Trump criticizing social media giants for discrimination against Republicans and conservatives. 

First, I need to understand the key points. Trump is accusing platforms like Facebook and Twitter of suppressing conservative voices, mentioning issues like shadow banning and algorithmic glitches. The platforms deny these claims, saying they're just ranking content for relevance. 

I should highlight Trump's main arguments: he's against censorship and believes too many voices are being silenced. He also contrasts this with media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he accuses of being fake news but doesn't demand their removal. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral angle, which is the issue of free speech and fairness in content moderation. Also, include the tech companies' responses to show both sides of the argument.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's accusations, mention the platforms' denials, include the example of the glitch, and end with Trump's stance on media bias. Keep it concise but comprehensive.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented. Make sure the summary flows logically, covering all essential points without getting too detailed.
