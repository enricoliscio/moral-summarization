Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

President Trump is accusing social media giants like Facebook and Twitter of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims too many voices are being suppressed. He's promising his administration will stop this. 

The article mentions that both Facebook and Twitter have been accused of censoring accounts, especially conservative ones, while ignoring rule violations by liberals. Trump has previously called Twitter's alleged "shadow banning" discriminatory and illegal. He uses Twitter daily, and his campaign in 2016 used Facebook effectively.

Conservatives have been complaining about this for years, but the issue escalated when Vice News reported that top Republicans, including Ronna McDaniel, were getting limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter responded, saying it was an algorithmic glitch fixed and denying shadow banning based on political views. They explained they rank tweets for relevance and address bad-faith actors.

Facebook apologized for mishandling Diamond and Silk's cases but denied bias against conservatives. Trump accused social media of closing down right-wing opinions while ignoring others. He called censorship dangerous and criticized CNN and MSNBC as fake news, though he doesn't demand their content be taken down.

So, the moral framing here is about fairness and free speech. Trump is arguing that social media's actions are unfair, suppressing conservative voices, which he sees as a threat to free expression. The tech companies, on the other hand, are trying to balance relevance and safety without bias. The summary needs to capture this conflict, highlighting Trump's accusations and the companies' responses, while keeping the moral perspective intact.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's accusations, the companies' refutations, and the underlying debate about free speech and fairness. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.
