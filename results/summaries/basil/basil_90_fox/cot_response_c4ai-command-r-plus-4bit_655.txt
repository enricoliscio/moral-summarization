SUMMARY: 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of expletives in a video where she vowed to impeach President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, citing their defense of Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk." She argued that the GOP had long forfeited their right to police women's behavior. Tlaib's comments sparked outrage among House Republicans, with leader Kevin McCarthy urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. However, Pelosi downplayed the incident, expressing distaste for the language but refusing to censor her colleague. She attributed the heated rhetoric to Trump's own inflammatory language. Trump, for his part, called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she had dishonored herself and her family. Tlaib stood by her words, asserting her commitment to speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez pledged her support, tweeting, "I got your back." The incident highlights the ongoing debate over acceptable political discourse and the double standards applied to women and men, especially in the context of the #MeToo movement. 

END OF SUMMARY.
