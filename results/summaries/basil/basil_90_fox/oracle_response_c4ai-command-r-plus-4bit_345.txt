SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib against criticism from House Republicans over her use of an expletive in a speech advocating for the impeachment of President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, pointing to their dismissal of Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" during the 2016 election. She argued that the GOP had lost its entitlement to policing women's behavior and expressed her support for Tlaib. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed Tlaib's language, suggesting that Trump's own rhetoric had set a precedent for heated discourse in Washington. Meanwhile, Trump called Tlaib's comments disgraceful, but she remained unapologetic, tweeting that she will always speak truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib highlights the ongoing debate about the appropriateness of certain language in political discourse and the double standards that may exist between different parties.
END OF SUMMARY.
