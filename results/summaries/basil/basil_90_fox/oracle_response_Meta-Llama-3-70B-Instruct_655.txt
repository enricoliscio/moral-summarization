SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood up for fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after her expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, pointing out their double standard in condemning Tlaib's language while downplaying Trump's admission of sexual assault on tape as "locker room talk." The lawmaker argued that the GOP has lost the right to police women's behavior, citing their faux-outrage over Tlaib's comments. Meanwhile, House Republicans fumed over Tlaib's remarks, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calling for action. Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the comments, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib refused to back down, vowing to "speak truth to power" in the face of a constitutional crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
