SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has defended fellow lawmaker Rashida Tlaib following her use of profanity in a speech advocating for the impeachment of President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, citing their lenient attitude towards Trump's lewd comments about women in the past. She argued that the GOP has no right to police women's behavior or language. Tlaib's remarks sparked outrage among House Republicans, who called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. Pelosi, however, downplayed the incident, expressing distaste for the language but refusing to censor her colleague. She attributed the heated rhetoric to Trump's own inflammatory language. Trump, for his part, denounced Tlaib's comments as disgraceful and dishonoring. Tlaib stood by her words, asserting her commitment to speaking truth to power. This incident highlights a larger moral crisis in Washington, where the boundaries of acceptable discourse are being tested by both sides of the political aisle. END OF SUMMARY.
