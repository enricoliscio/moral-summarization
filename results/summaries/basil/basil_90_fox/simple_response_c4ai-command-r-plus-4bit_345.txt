SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after the latter's use of an expletive in a speech about impeaching President Trump, accusing the GOP of a double standard regarding acceptable behavior and language from women. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the Republican Party's defense of Trump's lewd comments about women in a 2005 video as "locker room talk," contrasting it with their outrage over Tlaib's language. She asserted that the GOP has forfeited its right to police women's behavior. Ocasio-Cortez pledged support for Tlaib, while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. Pelosi, however, downplayed Tlaib's remarks, criticizing the language but suggesting that Trump's own rhetoric has set a precedent for heated discourse. Trump condemned Tlaib's comments as "disgraceful," while Tlaib herself doubled down, emphasizing the importance of speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib underscores a broader debate about gendered expectations and the application of moral standards in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
