SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments calling for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of having a double standard, citing Trump's past comments on the "Access Hollywood" tape as "locker room talk" while condemning Tlaib's language. Tlaib had vowed to impeach Trump, saying "we're gonna impeach the motherf***er" in a video. House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, criticized Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the issue, suggesting Trump's own language had contributed to the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself" and her family. Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would "always speak truth to power."

END OF SUMMARY.
