SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to defend Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of an expletive in her call to impeach President Trump, accusing Republicans of hypocrisy and double standards. Ocasio-Cortez drew a contrast between Tlaib's comments and Trump's past admissions of sexual assault, which he dismissed as "locker room talk." She pledged her support for Tlaib, stating that the GOP had long forfeited its right to police women's behavior. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act on Tlaib's remarks, but Pelosi downplayed the language, suggesting that Trump's own inflammatory rhetoric set the tone for such discourse. Trump himself labeled Tlaib's comments as "disgraceful," while Tlaib remained unapologetic, tweeting that she would always speak truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib highlights the ongoing debate about the acceptable boundaries of political discourse, with a focus on the hypocrisy and censorship surrounding women's language and behavior in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
