SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called out Republican hypocrisy after they expressed faux-outrage over Rep. Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of having a double standard, citing Trump's admission to sexual assault on tape, which he dismissed as "locker room talk." She tweeted that the GOP lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago. Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back" and that the Bronx and Detroit ride together. Tlaib had vowed to impeach the president, saying "we're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach the motherf***er." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, fumed over the comments, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed them, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib doubled down, tweeting that she "will always speak truth to power" and that this is not just about Trump, but about all of us facing a constitutional crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
