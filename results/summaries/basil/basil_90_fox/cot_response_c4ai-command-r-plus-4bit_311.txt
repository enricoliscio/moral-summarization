SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to the defense of fellow freshman lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib after the latter's use of an expletive in calling for the impeachment of President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of hypocrisy and double standards, citing their defense of Trump's lewd remarks about women as "locker room talk." She vowed to support Tlaib, condemning the GOP's attempts to police women's behavior and language. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed outrage and called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act, but Pelosi downplayed the comments, blaming Trump's rhetoric for setting a heated tone in Washington. Trump, in response, called Tlaib's remarks disgraceful and dishonorable. Tlaib stood by her words, asserting her commitment to speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez's defense highlights the moral framing of the issue, emphasizing the GOP's hypocrisy and the need to challenge power and speak truth in the face of a perceived constitutional crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
