SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after her comments about impeaching President Trump, accusing Republicans of a double standard. Ocasio-Cortez referenced Trump's lewd comments about women in a 2005 video, arguing that the GOP lost its entitlement to policing women's behavior. She pledged her support for Tlaib, who faced backlash from House Republicans for her expletive-laced remarks. Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed Tlaib's language, suggesting that Trump's rhetoric has set a tone in Washington. Tlaib herself doubled down on her comments, saying she will always speak truth to power.
END OF SUMMARY.
