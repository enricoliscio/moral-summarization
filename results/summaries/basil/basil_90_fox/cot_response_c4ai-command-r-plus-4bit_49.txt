SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended fellow freshman lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib following the latter's profane pledge to impeach President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of "hypocrisy," arguing that they ignored Trump's lewd "locker room talk" but expressed faux-"outrage" over Tlaib's language. Ocasio-Cortez asserted that the GOP forfeited their right to "policing women's behavior." Tlaib's comments sparked "outrage" among House Republicans, prompting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to call on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. Pelosi downplayed the remarks, blaming Trump's inflammatory language for setting the tone in Washington. She refused to engage in "censorship," stating that Tlaib's words were no worse than the president's. Trump, however, deemed Tlaib's comments "disgraceful," believing she had "dishonored" herself and her family. Tlaib stood by her words, tweeting about speaking "truth to power" and addressing a "constitutional crisis." Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, promising to "ride together" in their shared mission.
END OF SUMMARY.
