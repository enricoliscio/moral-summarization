SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, pointing out that they downplayed Trump's admission of sexual assault on tape as "locker room talk," but are now outraged over Tlaib's language. She tweeted her support for Tlaib, saying the GOP has no right to police women's behavior. House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Tlaib's remarks, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, citing Trump's own inflammatory language as the starting point for the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself" and her family. Tlaib refused to apologize, tweeting that she will always "speak truth to power."

END OF SUMMARY.
