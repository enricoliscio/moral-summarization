Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words they've listed. The user has specified that I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens, keep it under 200 words, and include as many of the morally framed words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez supports Rep. Tlaib after Tlaib made expletive-laced comments about impeaching Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of hypocrisy, pointing out their double standards regarding Trump's past comments. Tlaib's comments were part of her vow to impeach Trump, and she faced backlash from Republicans, including McCarthy and Trump himself. Pelosi downplayed the issue, comparing it to Trump's own language. Tlaib stood by her comments, emphasizing speaking truth to power in the face of a constitutional crisis.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article: hypocrisy, assault, scandalizing, faux-outrage, impeach, censorship, dishonored, speak, crisis. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Ocasio-Cortez's support for Tlaib, the hypocrisy accusation, the context of Trump's past comments, Tlaib's stance, Republican reactions, Pelosi's response, and Tlaib's defense. I'll ensure each moral word is used appropriately.

I should keep each sentence concise and within the word limit. Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and moral terms. After writing, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all specified terms are included.

SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib used expletives while vowing to impeach President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of hypocrisy, noting their double standard in condemning Tlaib’s language while excusing Trump’s past remarks about sexual assault. She highlighted Trump’s “locker room banter” from the 2005 Access Hollywood tape, where he later apologized but denied reflecting his true self. Tlaib, a freshman congresswoman, made her comments during a video with supporters, stating, “we’re gonna impeach the motherf***er.” House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, criticized Tlaib, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the remarks, comparing them to Trump’s own language. Trump called Tlaib’s comments “disgraceful” and said she “dishonored herself.” Tlaib doubled down, vowing to “speak truth to power” and emphasizing the constitutional crisis at hand. END OF SUMMARY.
