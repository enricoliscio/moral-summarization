SUMMARY:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib against GOP criticism over her expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of "hypocrisy" and having a "double standard," citing Trump's past "locker room talk" and lewd comments about women. She tweeted that the GOP had "lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago." Tlaib had vowed to impeach the president, saying "bullies don't win." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Tlaib's language, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed it, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib doubled down, tweeting that she would "always speak truth to power" and that this was a "constitutional crisis." Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, saying "the Bronx and Detroit ride together." END OF SUMMARY.
