SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, pointing out that they downplayed Trump's admission of sexual assault as "locker room talk" but were outraged by Tlaib's language. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Tlaib, saying the GOP had lost the right to police women's behavior. House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, suggesting that Trump's own language had contributed to the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she had "dishonored herself." Tlaib refused to apologize, tweeting that she would "always speak truth to power." The incident highlights the double standard in Washington, where powerful men are given a pass for their offensive language and behavior, while women are held to a different standard.

END OF SUMMARY.
