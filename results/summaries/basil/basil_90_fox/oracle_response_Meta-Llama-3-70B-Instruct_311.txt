SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called out the GOP's hypocrisy after they condemned Rep. Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of having a double standard, saying they downplayed Trump's admission to sexual assault on tape as "locker room talk" but were scandalized by Tlaib's curse word. She tweeted that the GOP lost the right to police women's behavior a long time ago. Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back." Tlaib had promised to impeach Trump, saying "bullies don't win." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, fumed over Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed them, saying Trump's language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib refused to apologize, saying she would always "speak truth to power" in the face of a "constitutional crisis."

END OF SUMMARY.
