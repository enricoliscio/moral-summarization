SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended fellow freshman lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib after the latter's use of an expletive in a speech advocating for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of double standards, arguing that they had no moral high ground when it came to policing women's behavior, given Trump's own history of lewd comments about women. She pledged her support for Tlaib, who faced backlash from House Republicans and Trump himself, who called her comments "disgraceful." Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed the remarks, citing Trump's own inflammatory language. Tlaib stood firm, asserting her commitment to speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez's defense highlighted the moral argument that those who tolerate or excuse offensive behavior by the President forfeit their right to criticize others for similar actions.
