SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments calling for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of having a double standard, citing Trump's past lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" while criticizing Tlaib's language. Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back" and that the Bronx and Detroit "ride together." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Tlaib's remarks, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, saying she wasn't in the "censorship business" and that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would "always speak truth to power."

END OF SUMMARY.
