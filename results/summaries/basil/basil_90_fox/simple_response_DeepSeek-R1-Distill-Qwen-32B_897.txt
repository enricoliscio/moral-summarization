Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The user provided a detailed article about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments about impeaching Trump. The article also mentions the reactions from Republicans, Pelosi, and Trump.

First, I should identify the key points. Ocasio-Cortez is calling out the GOP for a double standard, referencing Trump's past comments about women. Tlaib's comments were in support of impeachment, and she's getting backing from Ocasio-Cortez. Pelosi downplays the language but mentions Trump's own rhetoric. Trump reacts negatively, and Tlaib stands by her comments, emphasizing the need to address the constitutional crisis.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral angle, which seems to be about hypocrisy and the double standard in how women's behavior is judged versus Trump's. I should also highlight the support between the two congresswomen and the broader implications of their stance.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Ocasio-Cortez's support, then the context of Tlaib's comments, the reactions from Republicans and Pelosi, Trump's response, and Tlaib's defiant stance. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all necessary elements.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward, ensuring that the moral framing is evident through the comparison of Trump's past behavior and the criticism of Tlaib's language.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib used expletives while advocating for Trump's impeachment, accusing Republicans of hypocrisy. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the double standard, referencing Trump's own lewd remarks in the "Access Hollywood" tape, which he dismissed as "locker room banter." Tlaib, a freshman congressmember, vowed to impeach Trump during a bar speech, drawing criticism from House Republicans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address the remarks, but Pelosi downplayed the language, citing Trump's own inflammatory rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful," while Tlaib stood firm, emphasizing the need to address the constitutional crisis. Ocasio-Cortez vowed support, framing the issue as a broader fight against injustice.  
END OF SUMMARY.
