SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her colleague Rep. Rashida Tlaib against criticism from House Republicans over Tlaib's use of an expletive in a speech advocating for the impeachment of President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, highlighting their defense of Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" in the past. She argued that the GOP has no moral standing to police women's behavior. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed Tlaib's language, suggesting that Trump's own rhetoric has set a precedent for heated discourse in Washington. Tlaib herself doubled down on her comments, vowing to continue speaking truth to power. This exchange showcases the ongoing partisan divide in Congress, with Republicans expressing outrage over Tlaib's language while minimizing the significance of Trump's admitted sexual assault and his contribution to the deterioration of political discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
