SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments calling for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, citing Trump's past comments about women as "locker room talk" while condemning Tlaib's language. Tlaib had vowed to impeach Trump, saying "we're gonna impeach the motherf***er" in a video. House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, criticized Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, suggesting that Trump's own language had contributed to the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she had "dishonored herself" and her family. Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would "always speak truth to power."

END OF SUMMARY.
