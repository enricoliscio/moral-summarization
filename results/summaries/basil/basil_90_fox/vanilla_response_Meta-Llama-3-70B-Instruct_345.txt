SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments calling for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, citing Trump's past comments about women, which he dismissed as "locker room talk." Tlaib's comments sparked outrage from House Republicans, with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. However, Pelosi downplayed the incident, suggesting that Trump's own language had contributed to the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she had "dishonored herself." Tlaib stood by her remarks, tweeting that she would "always speak truth to power." Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back" and that the GOP had lost the right to police women's behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
