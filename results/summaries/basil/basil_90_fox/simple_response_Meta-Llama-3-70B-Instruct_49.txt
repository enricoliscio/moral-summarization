SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments calling for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, citing Trump's own history of offensive language, including the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape. She argued that the GOP has no right to police women's behavior, especially after excusing Trump's own misconduct. Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, saying "the Bronx and Detroit ride together." Meanwhile, House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Tlaib's language, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, suggesting that Trump's own rhetoric had set the tone for the heated language in Washington. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she had "dishonored herself." The moral of the story is that double standards and hypocrisy have no place in politics, and that women should not be held to a different standard than men when it comes to speaking truth to power.

END OF SUMMARY.
