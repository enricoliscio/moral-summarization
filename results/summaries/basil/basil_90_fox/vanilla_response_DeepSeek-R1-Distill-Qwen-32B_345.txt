Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. 

First, I see that Ocasio-Cortez took a stand on Twitter, accusing the GOP of having a double standard. She mentions how Republicans dismissed Trump's lewd comments as "locker room talk" but are upset over Tlaib's curse word. That's a key point.

Next, the article provides context about Trump's 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape where he made inappropriate comments. He apologized, calling it locker room banter. So, that's important to include because it sets up why Ocasio-Cortez is pointing out the double standard.

Then, Ocasio-Cortez vows support for Tlaib, saying "I got your back." Tlaib was taped after her swearing-in, vowing to impeach Trump. The video included a strong statement, which led to House Republicans reacting angrily. Kevin McCarthy asked Speaker Pelosi to act, but Pelosi downplayed it, saying she doesn't censor and that Trump's own language started the heated rhetoric.

Trump himself called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she dishonored herself and her family. Tlaib, however, stood by her comments, tweeting about speaking truth to power and it being about more than just Trump.

So, the summary should include the support from Ocasio-Cortez, the double standard accusation, the context of Trump's past comments, Pelosi's reaction, Trump's criticism, and Tlaib's defense. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed.

I'll structure it by starting with Ocasio-Cortez's support, then the double standard point, mention the 2005 tape, Pelosi's response, Trump's criticism, and Tlaib's stance. I should keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft that. Make sure to include all the main actors and their positions. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200. 

Wait, I need to make sure I'm not adding any extra information beyond what's in the article. Just the key points: Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, the double standard, Trump's past comments, Pelosi's downplay, Trump's reaction, and Tlaib's response. That should cover the main elements succinctly.
