SUMMARY:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, saying they scandalized themselves into faux-outrage over Tlaib's words while downplaying Trump's admission of sexual assault as "locker room talk." She tweeted that the GOP lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago. Meanwhile, House Republicans fumed over Tlaib's comments, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy prodding Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act. Pelosi downplayed the remarks, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib doubled down, tweeting that she would always speak truth to power and rise in the face of the constitutional crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
