SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended fellow lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib against criticism from House Republicans over her use of an expletive in a speech about impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, noting their defence of Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" while expressing outrage over Tlaib's language. She highlighted the double standard, arguing that the GOP has no entitlement to police women's behaviour. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed Tlaib's comments, citing Trump's own inflammatory rhetoric and refusing to engage in censorship. Tlaib herself doubled down, tweeting that she will always speak truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez vowed to support Tlaib, while Trump denounced Tlaib's comments as "disgraceful". This exchange showcases the differing moral stances of the parties involved, with Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib prioritizing truth and standing against perceived hypocrisy and censorship, while Trump and the GOP express outrage over language yet dismiss prior comments by the President.
END OF SUMMARY.
