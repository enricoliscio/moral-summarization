Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made some strong comments about impeaching President Trump. Tlaib used a curse word in a bar, which upset House Republicans. Ocasio-Cortez is criticizing the GOP for a double standard because they dismissed Trump's lewd comments as "locker room talk" but are upset about Tlaib's language.

I should mention that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support and called out the Republican hypocrisy. She referred to the 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Trump made inappropriate remarks, which he later apologized for. Tlaib, a freshman congresswoman, was filmed saying she would impeach Trump, using the expletive. 

House Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, were upset and wanted Speaker Pelosi to act, but Pelosi didn't see it as a major issue, comparing it to Trump's own language. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments disgraceful. Tlaib stood by her words, emphasizing the need to address the constitutional crisis.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points. I should structure it to first introduce the main actors and their actions, then the reactions from Pelosi and Trump, and end with Tlaib's response. Keeping it clear and to the point is key.
