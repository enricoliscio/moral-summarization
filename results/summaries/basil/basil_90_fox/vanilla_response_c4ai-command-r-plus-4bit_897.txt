SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended fellow freshman lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib following her use of an expletive in a speech advocating for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of double standards, citing their defense of Trump's lewd remarks about women in a 2005 video as "locker room talk." She pledged her support for Tlaib, stating that the GOP had long lost its entitlement to policing women's behavior. House Republicans criticized Tlaib's language, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the remarks, suggesting that Trump's own rhetoric set the tone for heated discourse in Washington. Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would always speak truth to power. Trump, meanwhile, called Tlaib's remarks "disgraceful." Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib highlights the solidarity among the new progressive members of Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
