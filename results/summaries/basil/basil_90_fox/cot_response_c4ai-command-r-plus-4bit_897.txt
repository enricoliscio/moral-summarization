SUMMARY: 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of profanity in calling for President Trump's impeachment, accusing Republicans of hypocrisy and double standards. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the GOP's dismissal of Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" while expressing faux-outrage at Tlaib's language. She asserted that the GOP had lost its entitlement to policing women's behavior. Pelosi also downplayed Tlaib's remarks, citing distaste for the language but acknowledging Trump's own inflammatory rhetoric. Tlaib, facing criticism from House Republicans, stood by her comments, emphasizing her commitment to speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez pledged support, showcasing solidarity among the freshman House members. The episode underscores the escalating tensions and divergent moral standards applied by the two parties.
