SUMMARY:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of "Republican hypocrisy at its finest" and "faux-outrage" over Tlaib's language, while downplaying Trump's own history of offensive comments. She tweeted, "GOP lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago." Tlaib refused to back down, saying she "will always speak truth to power" and that her comments were about standing up to the president in the face of a "constitutional crisis." Meanwhile, Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." The exchange highlights the heated rhetoric in Washington, with both sides accusing each other of wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
