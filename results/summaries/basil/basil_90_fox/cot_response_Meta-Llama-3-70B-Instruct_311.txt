SUMMARY:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laced call to impeach President Trump, accusing the GOP of "Republican hypocrisy at its finest" and "faux-outrage" over Tlaib's language. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the GOP lost the right to "police women's behavior" a long time ago, citing Trump's past "locker room talk" about sexual assault. Tlaib's comments sparked outrage from House Republicans, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself" and her family. Tlaib remained unapologetic, vowing to "speak truth to power" and rise to the "constitutional crisis" at hand. END OF SUMMARY.
