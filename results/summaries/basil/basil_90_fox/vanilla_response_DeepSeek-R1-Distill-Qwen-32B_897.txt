Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments about impeaching President Trump. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Ocasio-Cortez is criticizing the GOP for a double standard, pointing out that they dismissed Trump's lewd comments as locker room talk but are upset when a congresswoman uses a curse word. She mentions the 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Trump made those remarks. Tlaib was taped saying she would impeach the president, and House Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, are upset, but Pelosi downplays it, saying Trump started the heated rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's comments disgraceful, and Tlaib stood by her remarks, emphasizing the need to address the constitutional crisis.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by stating that Ocasio-Cortez defended Tlaib, highlighting the double standard. Mention the comparison between Trump's remarks and Tlaib's language. Then, include Pelosi's reaction and Trump's criticism. Finally, note Tlaib's response and the broader issue of the constitutional crisis.

I should make sure to keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be brief but cover all key points. Also, I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Ocasio-Cortez's defense, then the context of the double standard, reactions from Pelosi and Trump, and Tlaib's stance.

Let me draft it out:

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib used expletives to support impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the GOP for a double standard, pointing out they dismissed Trump's lewd comments as 'locker room talk' but reacted strongly to Tlaib's language. Tlaib, in a video, vowed to impeach Trump, calling him a'motherf***er.' House Republicans were angered, but Speaker Pelosi downplayed the remarks, noting Trump's own inflammatory language. Trump called Tlaib's comments 'disgraceful,' while Tlaib stood by her statement, emphasizing the need to address the constitutional crisis."

That's concise and covers all main points. Let me check the word count: 122 words. Good, under 200. I'll format it as per the instructions, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."
