SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, pointing out their double standard in condemning Tlaib's language while downplaying Trump's own offensive remarks, including his admission to sexual assault on tape. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the GOP has lost the right to police women's behavior, and vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, expressed outrage over Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the issue, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she had "dishonored herself." Tlaib refused to back down, tweeting that she would always "speak truth to power" and that the issue was about a constitutional crisis, not just about Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
