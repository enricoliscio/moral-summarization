SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of having a double standard, citing Trump's past comments on the "Access Hollywood" tape as an example of hypocrisy. Tlaib had vowed to impeach the president, using strong language, which sparked outrage from House Republicans. However, Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the comments, suggesting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would always speak truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Tlaib, saying "I got your back" and accusing the GOP of having no right to police women's behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
