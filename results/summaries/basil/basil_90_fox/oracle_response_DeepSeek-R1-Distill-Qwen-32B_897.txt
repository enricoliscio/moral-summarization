Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing used by the author. The key here is to identify the morally charged words and make sure they are included in the summary. The words listed are hypocrisy, assault, scandalizing, faux-outrage, comments, impeach, censorship, dishonored, speak, and crisis. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, referencing Trump's own inappropriate remarks. Tlaib stood by her comments, and Pelosi downplayed the issue, while Trump criticized Tlaib. 

I should structure the summary to include the moral terms. Start by mentioning the hypocrisy, then the context of Trump's assault comments. Ocasio-Cortez's support and the comparison to Trump's locker room talk. Include Tlaib's vow to impeach, the GOP's reaction, Pelosi's stance against censorship, Trump's criticism, and Tlaib's unapologetic response. 

I need to make sure each of those moral words is included naturally. Also, keep the summary under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all points are covered concisely. Make sure the flow is logical, starting from Ocasio-Cortez's support, moving to the context, reactions, and concluding with the crisis aspect. 

I should also check that the summary doesn't add any new information not present in the article. It's crucial to stay within the word limit and maintain clarity while preserving the moral framing. Let me piece it together, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary terms without sounding forced.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib’s expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump, accusing the GOP of hypocrisy. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the double standard, referencing Trump’s own scandalous remarks about sexual assault, which he dismissed as “locker room banter.” She emphasized that the GOP has lost the entitlement to police women’s behavior. Tlaib, a freshman congressmember, vowed to impeach Trump, drawing criticism from House Republicans. Pelosi downplayed the controversy, citing generational differences and rejecting censorship, while Trump called Tlaib’s comments “disgraceful.” Tlaib remained unapologetic, asserting her right to speak truth to power. The incident underscores a broader constitutional crisis, with Tlaib framing the issue as a collective struggle against injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
