SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib's expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, citing Trump's past comments about women as "locker room talk" while condemning Tlaib's language. She tweeted her support for Tlaib, saying the GOP lost the right to police women's behavior long ago. House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, criticized Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the issue, suggesting Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself" and her family. Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would always "speak truth to power." The exchange highlights the double standard in Washington, where Trump's offensive language is often excused while women like Tlaib are held to a different standard.

END OF SUMMARY.
