SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of an expletive in a speech about impeaching President Trump, accusing Republicans of a double standard regarding language and women. Ocasio-Cortez referenced a 2005 video in which Trump made lewd comments about women, arguing that the GOP lost its entitlement to policing women's behavior. She also vowed to support Tlaib, who faced criticism from House Republicans and Trump for her remarks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed Tlaib's language, suggesting that Trump's rhetoric had set a tone in Washington. Tlaib stood by her comments, tweeting that she would always speak truth to power.
END OF SUMMARY.
