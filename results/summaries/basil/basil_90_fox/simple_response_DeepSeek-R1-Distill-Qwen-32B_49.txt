Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the underlying moral arguments.

The article is about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments about impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of having a double standard, pointing out that they dismissed Trump's lewd comments as "locker room talk" but were upset about Tlaib's language. She emphasized that the GOP has lost the right to police women's behavior.

Tlaib made these comments in a bar, vowing to impeach Trump. House Republicans were upset, and their leader, Kevin McCarthy, urged Speaker Pelosi to act. However, Pelosi downplayed Tlaib's remarks, noting that Trump's own language had started the heated rhetoric. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she dishonored herself and her family. Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would always speak truth to power.

The moral framing here is about the double standard in how political figures, especially women, are treated. Ocasio-Cortez is highlighting that while Trump's inappropriate comments were excused, Tlaib's use of a curse word is being condemned. This points to a broader issue of gendered double standards in politics and public discourse. The article also touches on the idea of accountability and the right to express frustration without censorship.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral perspective, emphasizing the double standard and the support for Tlaib's right to speak out. It should also mention the reactions from Pelosi and Trump to show the contrast in how the same kind of language is treated differently based on gender and position.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the event, then Ocasio-Cortez's criticism of the double standard, Tlaib's comments, the reactions from Republicans and Pelosi, and Trump's response. Finally, I should note Tlaib's unwavering stance and the underlying moral issues.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll avoid getting bogged down in too much detail, focusing on the key moral points and the reactions that highlight them.
