SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib against criticism from House Republicans over her use of an expletive in a speech about impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of a double standard, arguing that they had excused Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" during the 2016 election. She also pointed out the GOP's history of policing women's behavior and language. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed Tlaib's remarks, blaming Trump for setting the tone of heated rhetoric in Washington. Despite criticism from Trump and House Republicans, Tlaib stood by her comments, vowing to continue speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez pledged her support for Tlaib, highlighting the solidarity between the two progressive lawmakers. The incident underscores the ongoing tensions between the Democratic-controlled House and the Trump administration, with impeachment a key issue for the new Congress. Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib also showcases the support and camaraderie within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. END OF SUMMARY.
