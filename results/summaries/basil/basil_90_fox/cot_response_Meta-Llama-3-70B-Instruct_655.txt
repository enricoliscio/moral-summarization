SUMMARY:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood up for fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after her expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of "Republican hypocrisy at its finest" and "faux-outrage" over Tlaib's words, while downplaying Trump's past lewd comments as "locker room talk." She vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back" and that the GOP "lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, were outraged, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the incident, citing Trump's own language as the starting point for the heated rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself," but Tlaib remained unapologetic, tweeting "I will always speak truth to power." END OF SUMMARY.
