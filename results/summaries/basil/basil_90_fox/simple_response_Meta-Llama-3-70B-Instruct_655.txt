SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood up for fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib after her expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of hypocrisy, pointing out that they downplayed Trump's admission of sexual assault as "locker room talk" but are outraged by Tlaib's curse word. She tweeted that the GOP has lost the right to police women's behavior and vowed to support Tlaib. Tlaib had vowed to impeach the president, saying "bullies don't win." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Tlaib's language, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed it, citing Trump's own rhetoric as the starting point for heated language in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself." Tlaib stood by her words, tweeting that she will always "speak truth to power."

This moral framing highlights the hypocrisy of the GOP and the double standard they apply to women's behavior, while also emphasizing the importance of standing up to power and speaking truth, even if it means using strong language.

END OF SUMMARY.
