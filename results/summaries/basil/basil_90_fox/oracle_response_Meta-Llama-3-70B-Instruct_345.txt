SUMMARY:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib against GOP backlash over Tlaib's expletive-laced comments calling for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of "Republican hypocrisy at its finest," citing their double standard in downplaying Trump's admission of sexual assault on tape as "locker room talk" while feigning outrage over Tlaib's language. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the GOP "lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago" and vowed to support Tlaib, saying "I got your back." Tlaib had vowed to impeach Trump, saying "bullies don't win," and refused to apologize for her comments, tweeting "I will always speak truth to power." House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, demanded action from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who downplayed the incident, citing Trump's own inflammatory rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and said she "dishonored herself" and her family. The incident highlights the heated rhetoric and crisis in Washington.

END OF SUMMARY.
