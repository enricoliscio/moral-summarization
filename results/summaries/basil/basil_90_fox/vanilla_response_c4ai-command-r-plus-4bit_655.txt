SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended fellow Democrat Rashida Tlaib following her use of an expletive in a speech about impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of double standards, citing their defense of Trump's "locker room talk" in the 2016 tape where he bragged about sexually assaulting women. She also vowed to support Tlaib, tweeting, "I got your back." Tlaib's comments sparked outrage among House Republicans, with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. Pelosi, however, downplayed the remarks, suggesting that Trump's own language had set a precedent for heated rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful," while Tlaib herself doubled down, tweeting that she will "always speak truth to power."
END OF SUMMARY.
