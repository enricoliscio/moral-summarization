Okay, so the user has given me a news article about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made some controversial comments. I need to summarize this article into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib, the context of Tlaib's comments, the reactions from Republicans, Pelosi's response, and Trump's comments. 

I need to make sure the summary captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll start by identifying the main actors: Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Pelosi, and Trump. Then, outline their actions and statements.

I should also note the context, like the 2005 video of Trump's remarks and how that ties into the double standard accusation. It's important to mention the support from Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib's stance on impeachment.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Ocasio-Cortez's support, then the context of the controversy, the reactions from both parties, and the broader implications. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and hits all the key points. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200. 

After drafting, I'll review it to ensure it flows well and accurately represents the article without any unnecessary details. That should cover everything the user needs.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the GOP for hypocrisy, pointing out that while Trump's lewd remarks were dismissed as "locker room talk," Tlaib's language was condemned. Tlaib, a freshman congressmember, vowed to impeach Trump during a video with supporters, referencing the president's 2005 "Access Hollywood" remarks. House Republicans condemned Tlaib's comments, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the issue, noting Trump's own inflammatory language. Trump called Tlaib's remarks "disgraceful," while Tlaib stood by her statement, emphasizing her commitment to speaking truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez vowed support for Tlaib, highlighting the need to address the constitutional crisis.  
END OF SUMMARY.
