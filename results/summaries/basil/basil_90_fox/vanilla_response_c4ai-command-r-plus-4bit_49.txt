SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of an expletive in calling for President Trump's impeachment, accusing the GOP of a double standard. Ocasio-Cortez pointed to Trump's 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape, where he made lewd comments about women, as an example of Republican hypocrisy. She also pledged her support for Tlaib, saying "the Bronx and Detroit ride together." Tlaib's comments sparked outrage from House Republicans, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. Pelosi downplayed the language, suggesting that Trump's rhetoric had set the tone for heated discourse in Washington. Trump called Tlaib's remarks "disgraceful," but she stood by her words, tweeting that she will "always speak truth to power." Ocasio-Cortez's defense highlighted the growing divide between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, particularly regarding the appropriateness of language used by elected officials.
END OF SUMMARY.
