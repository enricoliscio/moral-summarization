Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments about impeaching Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of double standards, referencing Trump's past remarks. Tlaib stood by her comments, emphasizing truth-telling. Pelosi downplayed the issue, while Trump called the comments disgraceful.

For STEP 1, I need to identify all the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again. Words like "hypocrisy," "scandalizing," "entitlement," "policing," "apologized," "disgraceful," "dishonored," "unapologetically," "constitutional crisis," "rise," and "truth" stand out as having moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I should mention Ocasio-Cortez's support, the double standard accusation, Tlaib's stance, Pelosi's reaction, and Trump's criticism. I'll make sure the summary flows naturally and stays under 200 words.

I think I've got all the key points. Let me put it together, ensuring the moral framing is preserved and the summary is clear and concise.

**SUMMARY:**

Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of hypocrisy, citing Trump's own lewd remarks about women and his "locker room banter" defense. She emphasized that the GOP has lost the right to police women's behavior. Tlaib, a new congressmember, stood by her comments, vowing to "speak truth to power" and impeach Trump. House Republicans criticized her, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the issue, noting Trump's own inflammatory rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's remarks "disgraceful," while Tlaib doubled down, framing the situation as a broader constitutional crisis requiring action. END OF SUMMARY.
