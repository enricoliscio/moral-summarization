Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez is criticizing the GOP for a double standard, referencing Trump's own lewd comments from the "Access Hollywood" tape. She points out the hypocrisy, saying Republicans criticized Tlaib for her language but ignored Trump's remarks. 

Tlaib, a new congresswoman, was caught on video using a curse word while discussing impeachment. House Republicans were upset, but Speaker Pelosi downplayed the issue, comparing it to Trump's own language. Trump himself called Tlaib's comments disgraceful. Tlaib stood by her remarks, emphasizing her commitment to speaking truth to power.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Ocasio-Cortez's support for Tlaib and the context of Tlaib's comments. Then mention the GOP's criticism and Ocasio-Cortez's point about the double standard. Include Pelosi's reaction and Trump's response. Finally, note Tlaib's defense of her comments.

I should make sure to include key points: the support, the double standard, Pelosi's stance, Trump's reaction, and Tlaib's defense. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers one main point without unnecessary details. Also, ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with Ocasio-Cortez backing Tlaib. Mention Tlaib's comments and the context of impeachment. Then the GOP's criticism. Ocasio-Cortez's criticism of Republican hypocrisy. Pelosi's downplay and comparison to Trump's language. Trump's reaction. Tlaib's defense. 

I think that's all the essential information. Now, I'll put it together succinctly, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as requested.
