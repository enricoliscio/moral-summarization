Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez supports Rep. Tlaib after Tlaib used a curse word when talking about impeaching Trump. Ocasio-Cortez is criticizing the GOP for double standards because they dismissed Trump's lewd comments as locker room talk but are upset about Tlaib's language. She mentions the 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Trump made inappropriate remarks, which he apologized for, calling it locker room banter.

Tlaib, a freshman, was taped saying she'd impeach the president and used the curse word. House Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, are upset, but Pelosi downplays it, saying Trump started the heated rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib's comments disgraceful, and she responded by saying she'll always speak truth to power.

The moral framing here is about the double standard in how the GOP handles language from Trump versus from women. Ocasio-Cortez is highlighting that the GOP has lost the right to police women's behavior after their handling of Trump's remarks. Pelosi supports this by pointing out Trump's own language. Tlaib stands firm, emphasizing the importance of speaking out against power.

I need to capture this in a concise summary, under 200 words, making sure the moral points are clear. I'll mention Ocasio-Cortez's criticism of GOP hypocrisy, reference the 2005 tape, Tlaib's comments, the Republican reaction, Pelosi's stance, Trump's response, and Tlaib's unapologetic stance. Keep it structured, highlighting the double standard and the support for Tlaib.
