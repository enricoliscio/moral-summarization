Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the context.

The article is about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez supporting Rep. Tlaib after Tlaib made some expletive-laced comments about impeaching Trump. Ocasio-Cortez is calling out the GOP for hypocrisy, pointing out that they didn't react as strongly when Trump made inappropriate comments but are upset over Tlaib's language. She's highlighting a double standard here.

I should note the morally framed words the author used: hypocrisy, assault, scandalizing, faux-outrage, comments, impeach, censorship, dishonored, speak, crisis. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The key points are Ocasio-Cortez's accusation of Republican hypocrisy, referencing Trump's past remarks, her support for Tlaib, Tlaib's comments about impeachment, the Republican reaction, Pelosi's downplay, Trump's criticism, and Tlaib's defense.

I should structure the summary to include these elements, making sure to use the moral terms. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while maintaining the moral perspective.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the important points and the moral framing words. I'll start by mentioning Ocasio-Cortez's support, then her accusation of hypocrisy, reference the 2005 tape, mention Tlaib's comments, the Republican and Pelosi reactions, Trump's response, and Tlaib's stance. I'll end with the constitutional crisis angle.

I should check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, ensure that the moral terms are appropriately integrated without forcing them in. The summary should read smoothly while highlighting the moral issues presented in the article.

Finally, I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib after Tlaib’s expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump, accusing Republicans of hypocrisy. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the double standard, pointing out that Republicans trivialized Trump’s admitted sexual assault remarks as “locker room talk” but condemned Tlaib’s language. She emphasized that the GOP has lost the right to police women’s behavior. Tlaib, a freshman congressmember, had vowed to impeach Trump, drawing criticism from House Republicans. Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed Tlaib’s comments, noting that Trump’s own language had set the tone for heated rhetoric. Trump called Tlaib’s remarks “disgraceful,” while Tlaib doubled down, stating she would “speak truth to power.” The situation underscores a constitutional crisis, with Tlaib framing the issue as a broader fight against injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
