SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended fellow lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib against criticism from House Republicans over her use of an expletive in a speech advocating for President Trump's impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of a double standard, pointing to their defense of Trump's lewd comments about women in a 2005 video as "locker room talk." She argued that the GOP had forfeited their right to police women's behavior. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed Tlaib's remarks, blaming Trump's own language for setting the tone of heated rhetoric. Tlaib stood by her words, asserting that she would always speak truth to power, while Trump found her comments disgraceful. Ocasio-Cortez pledged her support for Tlaib, showcasing solidarity among the new progressive lawmakers. This exchange highlights the ongoing debate about acceptable political discourse and the role of gender in shaping responses to controversial statements.
END OF SUMMARY.
