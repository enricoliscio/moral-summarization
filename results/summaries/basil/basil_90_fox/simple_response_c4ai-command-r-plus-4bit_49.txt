SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib following the latter's use of an expletive in a speech calling for the impeachment of President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of double standards, arguing that they had excused Trump's lewd comments about women as "locker room talk" but were now expressing outrage over Tlaib's language. She asserted that the GOP had lost the right to police women's behavior. Ocasio-Cortez pledged her support for Tlaib, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also downplayed the comments, blaming Trump's rhetoric for the heated discourse in Washington. Tlaib herself doubled down on her remarks, refusing to apologize and emphasizing the need to speak truth to power. Trump, meanwhile, criticized Tlaib's comments as "disgraceful." Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib highlights the growing solidarity among progressive women in Congress, who are challenging traditional power structures and norms.
END OF SUMMARY.
