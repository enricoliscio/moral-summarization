SUMMARY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to defend Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of an expletive in a speech about impeaching President Trump, accusing the GOP of hypocrisy and double standards regarding policing women's behavior. Ocasio-Cortez referenced Trump's own lewd comments caught on tape in 2005, which he dismissed as "locker room talk." She vowed to support Tlaib, stating that they will "ride together." Tlaib's comments sparked outrage among House Republicans, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action. Pelosi expressed distaste for the language but suggested that Trump's own rhetoric contributes to the heated political discourse. Trump, meanwhile, called Tlaib's comments "disgraceful" and accused her of dishonoring herself and her family. Tlaib stood firm, tweeting that she will continue to speak truth to power. Ocasio-Cortez's defense of Tlaib highlights the ongoing debate about acceptable political discourse and the perceived hypocrisy of the GOP in policing language and behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
