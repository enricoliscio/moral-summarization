SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails revealing internal debates over the government's official talking points on the Benghazi attack in September 2012. The emails show disagreements between the State Department and the CIA, as well as within the CIA, over how much to disclose about the attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, disagreed over the level of detail to include, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. The emails also show the White House mediating between the two agencies, with a focus on providing facts while protecting an ongoing investigation. Republicans have seized on the emails, claiming they show the administration altered its account of the attack for political reasons. However, the emails do not reveal new details about the attack or the administration's evolving account of it. The release of the emails aims to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.
