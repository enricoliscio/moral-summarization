SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points following the Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose, all under heavy time constraints. The final version of the talking points was stripped of material, including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters, which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. The White House insists that the drafting process was focused on providing the facts as they knew them, based on the best information available at the time, and protecting an ongoing investigation.
