SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the September 11 attack in Benghazi, Libya. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose about the threats and attacks in Libya. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy Congress. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA, with officials being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department. The final version of the talking points was stripped of material, including references to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters, which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.
