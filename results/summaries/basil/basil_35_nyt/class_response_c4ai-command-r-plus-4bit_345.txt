SUMMARY: E-mails released by the White House reveal a fierce internal struggle over the official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The e-mails show a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose. Mr. Morell deleted a reference to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The White House released the e-mails to counter Republican accusations that President Obama's staff altered the talking points for political reasons. While the e-mails show White House officials mediating between the State Department and the C.I.A., they do not reveal any new details about the administration's evolving account of the attack, which killed four Americans. The final version of the talking points stripped material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans argue that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during the election campaign. The release offers a rare glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack.
END OF SUMMARY.
