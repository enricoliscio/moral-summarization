SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing the intense internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy Michael Morell over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose, with no evidence of political interference. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign, while the White House argues that the emails show the focus was on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation.
