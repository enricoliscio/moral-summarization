Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they want the summary to include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible. The words listed are: attack, threats, sensitive, killed, protecting, airbrushed, threat, attacks, break.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses internal conflicts within the U.S. government regarding the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. Key players include the State Department, CIA, and White House officials. There were disagreements over how much information to disclose, especially concerning CIA warnings about threats. Michael Morell deleted references to these warnings, which led to accusations of political motives.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words. I'll start by mentioning the attack in Benghazi and the resulting internal conflict. I'll note the disagreements over disclosing threats and the sensitive nature of the information. The killing of Ambassador Stevens is important, so I'll include that. The term "protecting" can be used when discussing the investigation. "Airbrushed" and "threat" will come into play when describing how the talking points were altered. "Break" might refer to the breaking of news or the breaking of information flow, but I'm not sure if that fits well here.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the attack, the internal conflict, the disagreements over information, the consequences, and the political implications. I'll ensure each of the specified words is included where appropriate without forcing them in unnaturally.

Let me draft a few sentences, making sure each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. After drafting, I'll review to ensure all specified words are included and the summary accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
The article details internal conflicts within the U.S. government over the talking points used after the Benghazi attack, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others. Emails revealed disagreements between the CIA and State Department over how much to disclose about CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. Michael Morell, then CIA deputy director, deleted references to these warnings, sparking accusations of "airbrushing" the account. Critics argue the final talking points were "sensitive" to State Department concerns, omitting details that could raise questions about security. The process was "protecting" an ongoing investigation but also faced criticism for its political timing. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure, with the CIA and State Department vying to shape the narrative. The White House aimed to demonstrate that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate, but the "attack" on the administration's credibility continued. END OF SUMMARY.
