SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing fierce internal debate over the government's talking points following the Benghazi attack. The emails showed disagreement between CIA officials David Petraeus and Michael Morell over disclosure. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to. Petraeus dismissed the final talking points as insufficient and heavily scrubbed. The White House release aimed to show that intelligence officials drove the debate, but Republicans argued it confirmed the administration's airbrushing of the attack during an election campaign. The emails offered a rare glimpse into the White House's struggle to formulate a public account of the attack, revealing sensitivity to the State Department's concerns and highlighting the challenge of balancing disclosure with an ongoing investigation. The process involved multiple revisions and coordination between agencies, with the final language approved by White House advisers.
