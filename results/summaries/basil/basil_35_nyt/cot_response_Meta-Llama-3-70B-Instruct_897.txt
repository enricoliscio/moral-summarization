SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it. The emails portray White House officials as sensitive to State Department concerns, mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and CIA over how much to disclose. The release of the emails aims to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points. END OF SUMMARY.
