SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of e-mails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's talking points following the Benghazi attack. The e-mails show a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then director of the CIA, and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The final version of the talking points stripped material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans argue that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack for political reasons. The e-mails portray White House officials mediating a tug of war between the State Department and the CIA under heavy time constraints. While the e-mails reveal no new details about the administration's evolving account, they provide a rare glimpse into the White House's response to the deadly attack. They show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points. The release of the e-mails is intended to demonstrate the White House's focus on providing facts and protecting the ongoing investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
