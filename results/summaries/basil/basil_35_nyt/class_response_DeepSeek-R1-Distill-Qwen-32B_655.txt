Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about emails released by the White House regarding the Benghazi attack. There were disagreements between the CIA and State Department over the talking points used by Susan Rice. The CIA director, Petraeus, and his deputy, Morell, had differing opinions on how much to disclose. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like. The White House tried to mediate but the final talking points were stripped of some info, leading critics to say the administration airbrushed the account. Republicans accused them of altering the talking points for political reasons during the election. The emails show a tug of war between the agencies, with time constraints from Capitol Hill. The White House claims they focused on providing facts and protecting the investigation, but critics argue they were hiding details.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words: attack, threats, alter, mediated, killed, selectively, inaccurately, read, providing, protecting, airbrushed, threat, break, “abused”, beat. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the deletions, the political implications, and the administration's response. I'll start by mentioning the emails and the internal conflict. Then, note the deletion of threats and the State Department's objections. Mention the political reasons and the administration's denial. Include that the talking points were airbrushed and the criticism about hiding details. Conclude with the ongoing debate over transparency.

I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing is preserved through the use of those specific words. I'll make sure each key point from the article is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal conflict over the government’s talking points following the Benghazi attack, where four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed. The State Department and CIA disagreed on how much to disclose, with CIA Deputy Michael Morell deleting references to warnings about extremist threats in Libya, a move State Department officials opposed, fearing it would reflect badly on them. CIA Director David Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The White House mediated the bureaucratic tug of war, but critics accused the administration of selectively altering the talking points to protect the State Department during the election campaign. Republicans claimed the emails showed the administration had airbrushed its account, while the White House insisted it focused on providing facts and protecting the investigation. The final talking points were stripped of material that could have raised questions about security posture, leading critics to accuse the administration of hiding details. The process highlighted the political nature of the State Department’s concerns and the struggle to balance transparency with investigation protection. END OF SUMMARY.
