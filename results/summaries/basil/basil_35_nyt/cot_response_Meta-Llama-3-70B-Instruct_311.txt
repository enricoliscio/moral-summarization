SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying "Frankly, I'd just as soon not use this." The emails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose. Republicans seized on the emails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. The White House released the emails to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.
END OF SUMMARY.
