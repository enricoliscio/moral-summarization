SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy Michael Morell over how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. The State Department objected to the references, fearing they would reflect badly on them. The emails portray White House officials as mediators in a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA, with a focus on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration "airbrushed" its account of the attack during an election campaign, while the White House insists that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate. The emails offer a rare glimpse into the White House's efforts to piece together intelligence and formulate a public account of the attack. END OF SUMMARY.
