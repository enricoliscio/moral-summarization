SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials feared would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy House Democrats. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA, with officials being "concerned" about the implications of the talking points. Republicans claim the emails show the administration "airbrushed" its account of the attack for political reasons. The White House hopes to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
