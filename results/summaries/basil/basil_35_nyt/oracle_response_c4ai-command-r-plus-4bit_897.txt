SUMMARY: Newly released emails have revealed a fierce debate within the CIA and between the State Department and the CIA over the US government's talking points in the aftermath of the deadly Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails show a disagreement between then-CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose, with Mr. Morell deleting references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya out of concern for the State Department's reputation. The emails also reveal the White House's sensitivity to the State Department's concerns and the heavy time constraints under which the talking points were produced. While the White House maintains that the drafting process was focused on providing facts while protecting an ongoing investigation, critics argue that the final version omitted material that raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans have seized on the emails as evidence of the administration's attempt to airbrush its account of the attack during an election campaign. The release of the emails offers a rare glimpse into the internal deliberations of the White House as it struggled to craft a public account of the attack that killed four Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
