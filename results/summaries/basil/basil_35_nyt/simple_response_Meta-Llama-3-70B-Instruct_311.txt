SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points following the Benghazi attack in September 2012. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose about CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. The State Department objected to the references, fearing they would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA, with no evidence of political interference. However, critics argue that the final version of the talking points was stripped of material that would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during the election campaign.
