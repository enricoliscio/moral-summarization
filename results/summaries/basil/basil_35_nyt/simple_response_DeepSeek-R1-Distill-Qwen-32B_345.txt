Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the internal emails. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the article is quite detailed, so I should focus on the key points without getting bogged down in every detail.

First, the article talks about emails showing disagreements between the CIA and State Department over the talking points. The main issue is how much to disclose about the CIA warnings. Michael Morell deleted a reference, and Petraeus was unhappy with the final version. There's also the context of the White House releasing these emails to counter Republican claims of political interference.

I need to highlight the internal conflict, the deletions, and the implications. Also, mention that the emails didn't reveal new info about the attack itself. The White House's aim was to show that intelligence, not politics, drove the changes. But critics argue it's still political.

I should make sure to include the key players: Petraeus, Morell, Susan Rice, and the Republicans' reaction. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral angle about transparency and political motives.

Let me structure it: start with the emails revealing disagreements, then the deletions, Petraeus's dismissal, the White House's intent, and the criticism. Make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without too much detail.

Wait, I should also mention the timing—five days after the attack—and the pressure from Capitol Hill. That adds context about the urgency.

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all necessary points while keeping the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House reveal internal disagreements between the CIA and State Department over the talking points used after the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell clashed over how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats, allegedly without State Department pressure. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The White House released the emails to counter Republican claims of political interference, emphasizing that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the process. Critics argue the final talking points omitted key details, suggesting political motives. The emails show a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure, with no new information about the attack itself. The White House aims to demonstrate transparency, but critics remain skeptical about the administration's intentions. END OF SUMMARY.
