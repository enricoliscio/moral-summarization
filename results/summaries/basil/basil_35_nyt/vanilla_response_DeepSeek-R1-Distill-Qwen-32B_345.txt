Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the internal disagreements over the talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. The user wants a concise summary of no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. The key elements are the conflict between the CIA and State Department, the emails showing disagreements, Michael Morell deleting references, Petraeus's dismissal of the talking points, the White House's response, and the political implications.

I should structure the summary to include the main actors: Petraeus, Morell, Susan Rice, and the political context. Also, mention how the emails reveal the internal struggles and the White House's attempt to clarify their stance.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disagreements over the government's talking points following the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell clashed over how much information to disclose. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, reportedly acting on his own, while Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the State Department and CIA, with the White House mediating under time pressure from Capitol Hill. Critics argue the final talking points omitted key details, raising questions about security posture. Republicans accused the administration of politically motivated alterations, while the White House defended the process as focused on factual accuracy and protecting an ongoing investigation. The emails provided a rare glimpse into the decision-making process five days after the attack, highlighting the struggle to formulate a public account amid intelligence coordination. END OF SUMMARY.
