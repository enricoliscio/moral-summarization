SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal debate over the government's talking points following the deadly attack on Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012. The emails showed a disagreement between the CIA's then-director, David Petraeus, and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The final version of the talking points stripped of material, including references to the dangerous environment in Libya, has drawn criticism from Republicans who argue that the administration "airbrushed" its account of the attack for political reasons. The White House, however, maintains that the process was focused on protecting the ongoing investigation and providing the facts as they were known at the time. The emails also revealed the White House's sensitivity to the concerns of the State Department and their mediation role in the bureaucratic tug-of-war between the State Department and the CIA. The release offers a rare glimpse into the decision-making process of the White House in the aftermath of the attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
END OF SUMMARY.
