Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the article's main points. It's about emails released by the White House regarding the Benghazi attack, showing internal disagreements between the State Department and CIA over talking points. Key morally charged words include "attack," "threats," "alter," "mediated," "killed," "selectively," "inaccurately," "read," "providing," "protecting," "airbrushed," "threat," "break," "abused," "beat."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and structured to highlight the conflict and the moral implications. I'll start by outlining the main events: the emails showing disagreements, Morell deleting references, Petraeus's dismissal, the White House's release of emails, and the political implications. I'll ensure each morally framed word is naturally integrated without forcing them.

I should also capture the essence of the article, which is the internal struggle over the talking points, the deletion of information, and the political motivations. I'll need to mention how the State Department's concerns influenced the changes and the criticism from Republicans. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial. I'll draft the summary, then check to ensure all key points and moral terms are included effectively.

SUMMARY: The article details internal conflicts within the U.S. government over the official talking points regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Emails revealed disagreements between the CIA and State Department, with CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell deleting references to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, despite State Department objections. CIA Director David Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The White House released the emails to counter claims that the administration had politically altered the talking points, emphasizing that the process aimed to "provide the facts" and "protect an ongoing investigation." However, critics argue the final version was "airbrushed," omitting details that could raise questions about State Department security. Republicans accused the administration of selectively and inaccurately presenting information, suggesting political motives. The emails highlight a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure, with concerns over how the information could be "abused" to "beat" the State Department. The process reflects the complexities of balancing factual accuracy with political sensitivities in the aftermath of a tragic event. END OF SUMMARY.
