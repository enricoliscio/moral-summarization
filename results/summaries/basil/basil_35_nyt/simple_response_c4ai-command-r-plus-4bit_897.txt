SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing internal jostling over the government's talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA leaders David Petraeus and Michael Morell over how much to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The final talking points were stripped of material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans claimed the emails confirmed the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during the election campaign. The emails revealed a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the State Department and the CIA, mediated by the White House, with time constraints due to Capitol Hill demands. The release offered a glimpse into the White House's struggle to formulate a public account of the attack, balancing disclosure with an ongoing investigation. The process began on Sept. 14, with CIA officials warning against disclosing information that could interfere with the FBI probe. Emails from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and White House adviser Benjamin Rhodes reflected concerns about the talking points, with Nuland worried they could be "abused" by lawmakers. The emails showed an internal debate focused on balancing disclosure with protecting the investigation, with the CIA, State Department, and White House all involved.
END OF SUMMARY.
