SUMMARY: A fierce internal debate over the U.S. government's talking points following the Benghazi attack has been revealed through emails released by the White House. The emails show a disagreement between CIA leaders over how much to disclose, with David Petraeus dismissing the final talking points as insufficiently transparent. The White House released the emails to counter Republican accusations that the Obama administration altered the talking points for political reasons. While the emails do show sensitivity to State Department concerns, they suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic dispute between the State Department and the CIA. The final talking points were stripped of material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans welcomed the release of the emails, accusing the administration of airbrushing its account of the attack. The emails offer a rare glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack, revealing an internal process focused on protecting an ongoing investigation while respecting the interests of various government departments. END OF SUMMARY.
