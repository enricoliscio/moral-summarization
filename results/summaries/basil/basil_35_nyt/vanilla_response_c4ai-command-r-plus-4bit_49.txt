SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday that revealed internal debates within the Obama administration regarding the talking points used by Ambassador Susan Rice in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails showed disagreements between the State Department and the CIA, as well as between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department objected to. Petraeus disagreed with the final talking points, believing they would not satisfy lawmakers. The emails suggest that the White House mediated the dispute between the State Department and the CIA and was sensitive to the concerns of both agencies. Critics argue that the final talking points omitted important information that would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans claim that the emails confirm the administration altered its account of the attack for political reasons during the election campaign. The White House maintains that intelligence officials drove the debate over the talking points and that the emails show a focus on providing facts while protecting the ongoing investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
