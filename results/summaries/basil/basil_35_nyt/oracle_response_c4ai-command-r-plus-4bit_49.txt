SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disagreements within the CIA and between the State Department and the CIA regarding the content of talking points used by Ambassador Susan E. Rice in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails showed a fierce debate over how much information to disclose, with some references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya being removed due to concerns from the State Department. While the White House mediated the debate, Republicans argued that the administration "airbrushed" its account of the attack for political reasons during the election campaign. The emails offered a rare glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The process was focused on providing facts while protecting the ongoing investigation. The final talking points were stripped of material that critics say raised questions about the State Department's security posture. The White House, however, maintained that intelligence officials drove the debate over the talking points and that the emails showed no evidence of political interference.
END OF SUMMARY.
