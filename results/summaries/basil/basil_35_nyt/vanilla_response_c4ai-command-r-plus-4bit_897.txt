SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal debates over the government's talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails showed disagreements between the State Department and the CIA, with CIA director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, disagreeing on the level of disclosure. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The White House, mediating between the two agencies, maintained that the emails showed a focus on providing facts while protecting the ongoing investigation. Republicans argued that the emails confirmed the administration's airbrushing of the attack during the election campaign. The emails provided a rare glimpse into the White House's response to the Benghazi attack and the process of formulating a public account. The process involved multiple drafts and coordination between various agencies, with time constraints due to Capitol Hill demands. The final version of the talking points removed references to the dangerous environment in Libya, which critics say raised questions about the State Department's security posture.
END OF SUMMARY.
