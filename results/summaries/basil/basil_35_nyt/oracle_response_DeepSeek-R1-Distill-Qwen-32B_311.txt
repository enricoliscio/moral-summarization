Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. The user wants the summary to include words like "attack," "threats," "sensitive," "killed," "protecting," "airbrushed," "threat," "attacks," and "break." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about emails released by the White House regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack. There was a disagreement between the CIA and State Department over the talking points used by Susan Rice. The CIA director, David Petraeus, and his deputy, Michael Morell, had differing opinions on what to include. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like because it might make them look bad. The emails show a tug-of-war between the two departments, with the White House trying to mediate. Critics say the final talking points were "airbrushed" to protect the administration during the election. The White House released the emails to show the process was about providing facts and protecting the investigation, but Republicans think it was politically motivated.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes the moral words. I'll mention the "attack" in Benghazi, the "killed" ambassador, the "threats" and "extremist" references. I'll note the "sensitive" nature of the emails, the "protecting" of the investigation, and the "airbrushed" talking points. I'll also include how the State Department wanted to "break" from including certain information.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: start with the attack, mention the emails revealing internal disagreements, the deletion of warnings, the tug-of-war, the final talking points being stripped, and the political implications. I'll make sure to use the moral words naturally within the context.

I should keep the summary under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the internal conflict within the U.S. government over the official talking points regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others. Emails revealed a dispute between the CIA and State Department, with CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell deleting references to C.I.A. warnings about extremist threats in Libya, a move seen as "sensitive" to State Department concerns. CIA Director David Petraeus objected to the heavily "scrubbed" account, stating it wouldn't satisfy Representative Dutch Ruppersberger. The process involved a "bureaucratic tug of war" under time pressure, with the final talking points stripped of material that could raise questions about State Department security. Critics accused the administration of "airbrushing" the narrative for political reasons during the election campaign. The White House released the emails to show the process focused on "protecting" the investigation and providing facts, but Republicans argued it highlighted the administration's attempt to "break" from acknowledging the threats. The emails offer a rare glimpse into the government's struggle to formulate a public account while balancing "threat" information and political sensitivities. END OF SUMMARY.
