Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to understand the main points. It's about emails released by the White House regarding the Benghazi attack and the internal disagreements over the talking points. The key players are the State Department, CIA, and Susan Rice. 

I remember the user wants me to identify all single words that are morally framed in STEP 1. So, I'll scan through the text to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "fiercely," "disagreement," "disclose," "objected," "reflect badly," "sensitive," "mediated," "selectively," "inaccurately," "airbrushed," "motivations," "abused," "concerned," "resolve," "respect," "equities," "investigation," "protecting," "scrubbed," "dangerous," "critics," "question," "security," "posture," "welcome," "confirm," "complicit," "political," "alter," "pressure," "selective," "inaccurate," "cover," "cover-up," "justify," "transparency," "credibility," "scrutiny," "cover-up," "justify," "transparency," "credibility," "scrutiny," "cover-up," "justify," "transparency," "credibility," "scrutiny."

Next, I'll write the summary. I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible without making it too long. The summary should highlight the internal conflict, the deletion of references, the political implications, and the White House's attempt to clarify. I'll make sure to mention the key players and the main issues they faced, like the State Department's concerns and the CIA's actions. Also, I'll note the Republicans' accusations and the White House's response.

I have to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the essential points. I'll start by mentioning the emails and the internal conflict, then the deletion of references, the motivations behind it, the State Department's concerns, the final talking points, and the political implications. I'll end with the White House's response and the ongoing scrutiny.

Let me structure it step by step. First, the internal conflict, then the specifics of what was deleted, the motivations, the process under time constraints, the final talking points stripped of info, the accusations from Republicans, and the White House's attempt to show they were focused on facts and protecting the investigation. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear, concise, and includes all the necessary moral elements.

**SUMMARY:**  
The White House released emails revealing internal conflict over the government's talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials feared would reflect badly on them. The final talking points were heavily scrubbed, omitting details about Libya's dangerous environment, raising questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans accused the administration of airbrushing the account for political reasons, while the White House claimed the process focused on providing facts and protecting the investigation. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure, with no new details about the attack. Critics argue the final version stripped key information, suggesting political motivations. The White House aimed to show intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate, but the emails highlighted the administration's sensitivity to State Department concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
