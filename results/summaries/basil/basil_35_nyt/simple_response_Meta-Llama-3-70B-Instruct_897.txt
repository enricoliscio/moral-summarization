SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing internal debates over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy House Democrats. The emails portray White House officials as mediators between the State Department and CIA, with no evidence of political interference. However, Republicans argue that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during the election campaign. The release of the emails aims to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.
