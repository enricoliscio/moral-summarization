SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday that revealed a fierce internal debate over the government's talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between the CIA and the State Department, as well as between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department objected to. Petraeus dismissed the final talking points as inadequate and unlikely to satisfy lawmakers. The emails suggest that White House aides mediated a bureaucratic struggle between the State Department and the CIA, rather than driving the debate over the talking points. The emails also revealed that the State Department was concerned about the talking points being used to criticize them for not heeding CIA warnings. The release offers a rare glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack shortly after it occurred.
END OF SUMMARY.
