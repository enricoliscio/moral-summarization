SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing internal disagreements over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack in September 2012. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it. The emails portray White House officials as mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and CIA over how much to disclose. Republicans welcomed the release, saying it confirmed the administration had altered its account of the attack during an election campaign. The emails show no new details about the administration's evolving account of the attack.
