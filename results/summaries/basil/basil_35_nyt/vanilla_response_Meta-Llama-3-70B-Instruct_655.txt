SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday, revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack in September 2012. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy Congressional requests. The emails suggest that White House officials mediated a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the State Department and CIA over how much to disclose, under heavy time constraints. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration altered its account of the attack for political reasons. The White House released the emails to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.
