SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the September 11 attack in Benghazi, Libya. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it. The emails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose. The final version of the talking points was stripped of material, including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters, which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans welcomed the release of the emails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.
