Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. It's about emails released by the White House regarding the Benghazi attack and the internal disagreements over the talking points. The author uses words like "attack," "threats," "alter," and others that carry moral weight.

I should identify the key events: the emails show a dispute between the CIA and State Department over what to include in the talking points. Michael Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it wouldn't satisfy a House Democrat. The White House released the emails to counter Republican claims of political motives.

I need to include the morally framed words without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to highlight the conflict, the deletions, and the political implications. Also, note the White House's attempt to show they were focused on facts and protecting the investigation.

Let me make sure to mention the specific morally charged terms like "attack," "alter," "selectively," "airbrushed," etc. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay under 200 words. Okay, I think I have a clear summary that captures the moral framing and the main events.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disputes over the government's talking points regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, a move State Department officials opposed. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, stating it wouldn't satisfy House Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure, with the White House aiming to counter Republican claims of political motives. Critics argue the final talking points were "airbrushed," omitting details like Libya's dangerous environment, raising questions about the State Department's security posture. The release aimed to show intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate, but the process revealed selective and inaccurate portrayals of the attack. END OF SUMMARY.
