Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the internal conflict over the talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about emails released by the White House showing disagreements between the State Department and CIA. It mentions Petraeus and Morell disagreeing on what to include in the talking points used by Susan Rice. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like. There's tension over how much to disclose under time pressure from Capitol Hill.

The White House released these emails to counter Republican claims that the administration was altering the talking points for political reasons. The emails show that while the White House was sensitive to State Department concerns, it was mostly mediating between the two agencies. The final talking points were stripped of some details, which critics say downplayed the State Department's security issues.

Republicans argue that the administration airbrushed the account, especially during the election. The White House wanted to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, were driving the debate. The emails reveal the process of trying to balance providing facts while protecting the investigation.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the internal conflict between State and CIA, the deletion of references, the White House's response to Republican claims, and the implications of the final talking points. I'll make sure to include the main actors and the outcome of the situation.

Let me structure it: start with the release of emails showing disagreements, mention the key players (Petraeus, Morell, State Department), the deletion of references, the White House's intent to counter Republican claims, and the criticism from both sides. Conclude with the significance of the emails revealing the decision-making process.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in the timeline details and focus on the main conflicts and outcomes. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal conflicts over the government's talking points following the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on disclosing information, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya. State Department officials opposed this, fearing it would reflect poorly on them. The final talking points, used by Ambassador Susan Rice, were criticized for omitting details about Libya's dangerous environment. The White House aimed to counter Republican claims of political manipulation, emphasizing that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the process. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure from Capitol Hill, with no new details about the attack emerging. Critics argue the administration downplayed the State Department's security posture, while Republicans accused them of altering the narrative for political gain. END OF SUMMARY.
