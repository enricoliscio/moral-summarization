SUMMARY: The White House released e-mails revealing a fierce internal struggle over the government's talking points following the Benghazi attack. The e-mails showed a disagreement between the CIA and the State Department, with CIA officials disagreeing over how much to disclose. The State Department objected to references that would reflect badly on them, and CIA Deputy Michael Morell acted on his own to remove these references. The e-mails revealed a bureaucratic tug-of-war mediated by the White House, with officials sensitive to the concerns of both agencies. The final talking points were stripped of material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans argued that the administration airbrushed its account for political reasons, while the White House insisted that intelligence officials drove the debate. The e-mails reveal a process focused on protecting an ongoing investigation while balancing the concerns of multiple agencies.
END OF SUMMARY.
