Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses emails released by the White House regarding the internal disputes over the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. The main conflict is between the State Department and the CIA, especially between Petraeus and Morell. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like. The emails show that the process was under time pressure from Capitol Hill, and the final talking points were stripped of some details, leading to accusations of altering the account for political reasons.

I need to highlight the moral elements like "attack," "threats," "alter," "mediated," "killed," "selectively," "inaccurately," "read," "providing," "protecting," "airbrushed," "threat," "break," "abused," "beat." I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll focus on the conflict, the deletions, the political implications, and the accusations of selective and inaccurate reporting. I should also mention the White House's attempt to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, were driving the process.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and the key events without going over the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and includes the necessary framing words. Once done, I'll review it to make sure all important points are covered and the moral aspects are preserved.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disputes over the government’s talking points following the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. The State Department and CIA clashed over how much to disclose, with CIA Deputy Michael Morell deleting references to extremist threats in Libya, sparking concerns about selective and inaccurate reporting. The final talking points, stripped of details about Libya’s dangerous environment, were criticized for airbrushing the administration’s account. Republicans accused the White House of altering the narrative for political reasons, while the administration claimed the process focused on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug of war, with Morell acting independently to remove CIA warnings, and State Department officials fearing the information would be abused to beat them. The process was mediated under heavy time constraints, with intelligence officials, not political advisers, driving the debate. The release aimed to clarify the drafting process but raised questions about motivations and security posture. END OF SUMMARY.
