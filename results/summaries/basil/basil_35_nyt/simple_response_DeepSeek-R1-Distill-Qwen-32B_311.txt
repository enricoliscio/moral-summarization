Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about emails released by the White House regarding the internal disagreements over the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. The key players are the State Department, CIA, and White House officials. There's a conflict between Petraeus and Morell about how much to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings, which State Department didn't like because it could make them look bad. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it wouldn't satisfy a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

The emails show that the White House was trying to mediate between State and CIA under time pressure. They released the emails to counter Republican claims that the administration was altering talking points politically. However, critics argue that the final version omitted important details, making it seem like the State Department's security was inadequate. Republicans saw this as evidence of political manipulation, especially during the election campaign.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the internal disagreements, the role of each department, and the political implications. I should highlight the moral framing, such as the accusations of political motives and the administration's attempt to clarify their intentions.

Let me structure it: start with the release of emails, describe the internal conflict, mention the deletions and the reasons, Petraeus's dismissal, the White House's response, and the political implications. Keep it concise, ensuring each main point is covered without extra details.

SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing internal disputes over the talking points used after the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials opposed, fearing it would reflect poorly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, stating it wouldnâ€™t satisfy a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. The emails showed the White House mediating between State and CIA under time pressure, with no new details about the attack. Critics argue the final talking points omitted key information, raising questions about State Department security. Republicans accused the administration of politically motivated alterations, while the White House claimed the process focused on factual accuracy and protecting an ongoing investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
