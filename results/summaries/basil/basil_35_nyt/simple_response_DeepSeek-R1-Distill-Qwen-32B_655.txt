Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the internal emails between government agencies. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points and the underlying issues.

First, the article talks about emails showing disagreements between the CIA and State Department over talking points. The main issue is how much information to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like because it could make them look bad. That's a conflict over transparency and accountability.

Petraeus didn't like the final draft because it was too scrubbed, suggesting they were hiding information. The White House released these emails to counter Republican claims of political interference, but the emails show a tug-of-war between agencies under time pressure. Critics say they were hiding details to protect the State Department's image, especially during an election.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key players: Petraeus, Morell, the State Department, and the political context. Also, the moral aspects like transparency, political motives, and the handling of information during an investigation.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main conflicts, the deletions, the White House's response, and the implications of the emails. I'll structure it to show the internal struggle and the political implications, maintaining the moral framing about information handling and political motives.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House reveal internal disputes over the government's talking points regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials opposed, fearing it would reflect poorly on them. Petraeus criticized the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory and stripped of key details. The emails show a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the CIA and State Department under time pressure, with the White House aiming to counter Republican claims of political interference. Critics argue the final talking points omitted critical information, raising questions about the State Department's security posture. The release highlights the administration's focus on providing facts while protecting an ongoing investigation, but Republicans maintain the changes were politically motivated. END OF SUMMARY.
