Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me start by understanding the article.

The article talks about internal disagreements within the U.S. government regarding the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. Key players include the State Department, CIA, and White House. There's a conflict over how much information to disclose, especially regarding CIA warnings about threats. Michael Morell deleted references to these warnings, and Petraeus was unhappy with the final draft. The White House released emails to counter claims of political interference, but critics argue they airbrushed the account to protect the State Department.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using the specified moral terms: attack, threats, sensitive, killed, protecting, airbrushed, threat, attacks, break. I should ensure the summary captures the internal conflict, the deletion of information, and the political implications without exceeding 200 words.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the internal jostling, the specific actions taken by Morell and Petraeus, the reasons behind the deletions, and the broader implications regarding transparency and political motivations. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words naturally within the summary.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear, concise, and includes all necessary elements while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article details internal conflicts within the U.S. government over the handling of talking points following the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. Emails revealed disagreements between the State Department and CIA, particularly over how much to disclose about CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. Michael Morell, CIA deputy director, deleted references to these warnings, acting independently, while David Petraeus, then CIA director, criticized the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The White House released the emails to counter claims of political interference, emphasizing that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the process. Critics argue the final talking points were airbrushed to protect the State Department’s image, omitting details about Libya’s dangerous environment. The emails show a sensitive tug-of-war between agencies under time pressure, with concerns about how information was presented to the public. The process highlights tensions between transparency and political motives in shaping the narrative of the attack. END OF SUMMARY.
