SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House on Wednesday reveal internal disagreements within the Obama administration following the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails show a dispute between the CIA and the State Department over how much information to disclose to the public, with the State Department fearing that revealing CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya would reflect badly on them. Michael Morell, the deputy director of the CIA, deleted a reference to these warnings, but CIA director David Petraeus objected to the heavily redacted talking points. The White House, mediating between the two agencies, released the emails to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, were driving the debate. However, critics argue that the final version of the talking points omitted material that raised questions about the State Department's security posture. The emails provide a rare glimpse into the internal deliberations of the Obama administration as it struggled to formulate a public account of the attack, which killed four Americans. The release of the emails sparked further debate between the White House and Republicans, who claimed that the administration had airbrushed its account for political reasons. This summary highlights the moral responsibility of the Obama administration to provide transparent and accurate information to the public, while navigating the complexities of national security and political interests.
