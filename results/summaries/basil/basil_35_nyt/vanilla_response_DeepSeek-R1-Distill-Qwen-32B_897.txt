Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about emails released by the White House regarding the internal discussions on the government's talking points after the Benghazi attack. The key players are the State Department and CIA, with disagreements over how much to disclose.

David Petraeus, the CIA director, and Michael Morell, his deputy, had a disagreement. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings, which the State Department didn't like. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it wouldn't satisfy a House Democrat.

The White House released these emails to counter Republican claims that they were altering the talking points for political reasons. The emails show a bureaucratic battle between the State Department and CIA, under time pressure from Capitol Hill.

The talking points were stripped of some details, like Libya's dangerous environment, which critics say downplayed security issues. Republicans argue this shows political motives, while the White House claims it was about protecting the investigation.

The process involved several officials coordinating changes, with the State Department concerned about being blamed. The final version was sent just before Susan Rice's TV appearances.

So, the summary should cover the internal disagreements, the role of Morell and Petraeus, the State Department's concerns, and the broader context of the political implications. I'll need to condense this into a concise 200-word summary.
