SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday, revealing internal debates over the government's talking points following the Benghazi attack. The emails showed disagreements between the CIA and the State Department, with CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, at odds over the level of disclosure. Morell removed references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect poorly on them. The emails suggest that White House aides mediated the dispute between the agencies while facing time constraints. The final version of the talking points omitted material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans argued that the emails confirmed the administration's attempt to alter the talking points for political reasons during an election campaign. The White House, however, asserted that intelligence officials drove the debate and that the emails showed a focus on providing facts and protecting the ongoing investigation. The release offers a glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack, which killed four Americans, in the days following the incident.
