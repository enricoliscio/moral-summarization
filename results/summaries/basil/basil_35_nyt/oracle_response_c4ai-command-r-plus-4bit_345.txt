SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disputes within the CIA and between the State Department and the CIA over the content of talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. The emails showed that Michael Morell, deputy director of the CIA, deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect poorly on them. The final talking points were stripped of material that raised questions about the State Department's security posture, leading Republicans to accuse the administration of airbrushing its account of the attack. The emails also revealed the White House's efforts to mediate between the CIA and the State Department while facing time constraints and the need to protect an ongoing investigation. Ultimately, the talking points were used by Susan Rice, the ambassador to the UN, in television appearances, drawing further criticism and scrutiny.
END OF SUMMARY.
