Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about internal conflicts within the U.S. government regarding the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. Key players include the State Department, CIA, and Susan Rice. The emails show disagreements over what information to include, especially regarding threats and warnings.

I notice the article mentions that Morell deleted references to CIA warnings, which could make the State Department look bad. The White House tried to show they were protecting the investigation but ended up releasing emails that critics say were airbrushed. The summary needs to include words like attack, threats, protecting, airbrushed, etc.

I should structure the summary to highlight the internal jostling, the deletion of warnings, the pressure from Capitol Hill, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include all the morally framed words without making it too long, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll start by stating the release of emails revealing internal conflicts over talking points after the Benghazi attack. Then mention the disagreements between Petraeus and Morell, the deletion of references, and the State Department's objections. Include how the White House tried to protect the investigation but critics say they airbrushed the account. Finally, note the political implications and the focus on providing facts under pressure.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary moral terms. Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal conflicts over the government’s talking points following the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. The State Department and CIA disagreed on how much to disclose, with CIA Deputy Michael Morell deleting references to warnings about extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials feared would reflect poorly on them. CIA Director David Petraeus dismissed the final draft, stating it wouldn’t satisfy House Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger. The White House aimed to show the process was focused on protecting the investigation, but critics argue the talking points were airbrushed to avoid raising questions about the State Department’s security posture. The emails suggest a bureaucratic tug-of-war under political pressure, with the final version stripped of material about Libya’s dangerous environment. Republicans accused the administration of altering the narrative for political reasons, while the White House maintained the process was driven by intelligence officials. The release offered a rare glimpse into the struggle to formulate a public account while balancing competing interests. END OF SUMMARY.
