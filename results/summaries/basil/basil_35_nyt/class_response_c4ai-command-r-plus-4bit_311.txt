SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House reveal internal disputes over the government's talking points following the deadly attack on the US compound in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show disagreements between the State Department and the CIA, with the CIA's then-director, David Petraeus, expressing dissatisfaction with the final talking points, believing they did not adequately address the extremist threats in Libya. The State Department pushed for the removal of references to CIA warnings, fearing they would reflect poorly on the department. The White House mediated the dispute, aiming to protect the ongoing investigation while providing facts to the public. Republicans have criticized the administration for altering the talking points and downplaying the attack during an election campaign. The emails provide insight into the White House's efforts to coordinate with multiple agencies and craft a public account of the attack, revealing the challenges of managing sensitive information and political implications. The final talking points removed references to the dangerous environment in Libya, leading to criticism that the State Department's security posture was not adequately questioned.
