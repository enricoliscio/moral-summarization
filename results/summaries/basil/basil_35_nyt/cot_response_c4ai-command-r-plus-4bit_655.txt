SUMMARY:
The White House released emails revealing fierce internal disagreements between the State Department and the CIA over the official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a dispute between then-CIA director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over the level of disclosure in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect poorly on them. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a bureaucratic battle between the agencies under time constraints. Critics argue that the final version omitted material that would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans allege that the administration airbrushed its account for political reasons during the election campaign. The emails provide a rare glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack, which killed four Americans, in the days following the tragedy. They also highlight the concerns of various parties involved, including the State Department's worries about potential abuse of the talking points by lawmakers and the FBI's ongoing investigation. The White House maintains that the drafting process aimed to protect the investigation while providing facts based on the best available information.
