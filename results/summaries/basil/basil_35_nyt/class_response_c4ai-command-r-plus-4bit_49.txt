SUMMARY: E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal debate over the official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The e-mails showed a disagreement between then-CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by UN Ambassador Susan Rice. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department objected to. The White House released the e-mails to counter Republican accusations that they had altered the talking points for political reasons. The e-mails revealed that the White House mediated a tug of war between the State Department and the CIA, under time constraints. While the final version of the talking points removed references to the dangerous environment in Libya, the e-mails showed that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate. The release offers a glimpse into the White House's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
END OF SUMMARY.
