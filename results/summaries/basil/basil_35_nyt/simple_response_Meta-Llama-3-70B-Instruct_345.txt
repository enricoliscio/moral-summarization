SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing internal disagreements over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails show a tug-of-war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose, with CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy Michael Morell disagreeing on the level of detail. The State Department objected to references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, fearing it would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that the White House mediated the dispute, prioritizing the provision of facts over political considerations. Republicans claim the emails show the administration airbrushed its account of the attack for political reasons, while the White House insists it was focused on providing accurate information. The release of the emails offers a rare glimpse into the White House's handling of the crisis, highlighting the bureaucratic struggles and time constraints involved.
