Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the conflict between different agencies.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about emails released by the White House showing internal conflicts over the talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. The State Department and CIA had disagreements about what to include, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings. The emails suggest a bureaucratic battle, and the White House tried to show they were just mediating. Republicans accused them of altering the narrative for political reasons, especially during the election.

Now, I need to identify the moral framing. The article highlights issues like transparency, accountability, and political interference in information dissemination. The CIA and State Department's conflict raises questions about whose interests were being servedâ€”whether it was about protecting the administration or omitting important details.

I should structure the summary to include these elements: the internal conflict, the deletion of information, the White House's response, Republican accusations, and the ethical implications. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all key points.

I'll start by mentioning the emails revealing internal conflicts, then detail the disagreement between Petraeus and Morell. Highlight Morell deleting the reference and the reasons. Then, the White House's attempt to show they were mediating but the emails showing a tug-of-war. Republicans' accusations of political motives. Finally, the ethical concerns about transparency and accountability.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the conflict, the actions taken, the White House's response, the political implications, and ending with the moral questions raised. Keeping each sentence focused on one point to maintain clarity and brevity.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words. Once done, I'll review to ensure it captures the moral framing and accurately reflects the article's content.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House reveal internal conflicts over the government's talking points regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack. The State Department and CIA disagreed on how much to disclose, with CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell deleting references to warnings about extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials opposed. CIA Director David Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The emails show a bureaucratic tug-of-war under time pressure, with the White House mediating. Critics argue the final talking points omitted key details, raising questions about transparency and political motives. Republicans accused the administration of altering the narrative for political gain during the election. The emails highlight concerns about accountability and the integrity of the information provided to the public. END OF SUMMARY.
