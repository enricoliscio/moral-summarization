SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose about CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. Morell deleted references to these warnings, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy House Democrats. The emails portray White House officials as mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and CIA over how much to disclose, all under heavy time constraints. Republicans claim the emails confirm the administration "airbrushed" its account of the attack during an election campaign, while the White House insists the drafting process was focused on providing the facts and protecting an ongoing investigation.
