SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose about CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. Morell deleted a reference to these warnings, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it. The emails portrayed White House officials as mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and CIA, with a focus on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. However, critics argue that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack, deleting material that would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. The release of the emails confirmed that the administration had altered its account of the attack during an election campaign.
