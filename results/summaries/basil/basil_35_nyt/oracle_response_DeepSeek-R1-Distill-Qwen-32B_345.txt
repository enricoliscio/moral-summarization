Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: attack, threats, sensitive, killed, protecting, airbrushed, threat, attacks, break. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about emails released by the White House showing internal disagreements over the talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. Key players include the State Department, CIA, Susan Rice, David Petraeus, Michael Morell, and political implications.

I need to highlight the conflict between Petraeus and Morell over what to include in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings, which State Department opposed because it reflected badly on them. The talking points were stripped of info about Libya's dangerous environment, which critics say undermines State's security posture.

The author uses words like "attack," "killed," "threats," "protecting," "airbrushed," etc. I should incorporate these. The summary should mention the political reasons behind the changes and the White House's attempt to show they were protecting the investigation. Also, note that the emails suggest a tug of war between State and CIA under time pressure.

I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll structure it to include the main conflict, the deletions, the political implications, and the White House's response. Make sure to use the moral words where appropriate.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the key moral terms. Let me check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal conflicts over the government's talking points following the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya. State Department officials objected, fearing it would reflect poorly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The emails suggest a bureaucratic tug of war between State and CIA under time pressure from Capitol Hill. Critics argue the final talking points were airbrushed, omitting details about Libya's dangerous environment, raising questions about State's security posture. Republicans accused the administration of altering the narrative for political reasons. The White House aimed to show intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate, but the process highlighted the sensitive balance between providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
