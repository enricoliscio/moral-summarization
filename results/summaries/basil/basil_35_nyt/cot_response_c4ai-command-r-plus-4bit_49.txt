SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal jostling over the talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between the CIA and the State Department, with the CIA's David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, at odds over how much to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The final talking points were stripped of material that critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans argue that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. The White House, however, maintains that the emails show that intelligence officials drove the debate over the talking points and that they were focused on providing the facts while protecting an ongoing investigation. The emails reveal a contentious process where the State Department's concerns about warnings being abused were respected by White House aides who mediated between the two agencies. END OF SUMMARY.
