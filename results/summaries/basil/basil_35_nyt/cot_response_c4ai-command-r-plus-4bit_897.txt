SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal jostling over the talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between the CIA director, David Petraeus, and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect badly on them. The final version of the talking points was heavily scrubbed, stripped of material that could raise questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans welcomed the release of the emails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. The White House, however, portrayed its role as mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA under heavy time constraints. The emails also revealed the internal concerns and discussions within the Obama administration as they struggled to formulate a public account of what happened in Benghazi. Emails showed a focus on protecting an ongoing investigation and respecting relevant equities while also addressing the concerns of the State Department. END OF SUMMARY.
