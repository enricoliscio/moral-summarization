Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, okay, so the article is about emails released by the White House regarding the Benghazi attack. The key points seem to be the disagreements between the CIA and State Department over the talking points used by Susan Rice.

First, I should identify the main elements: the emails show internal conflict, Petraeus and Morell disagreeing on how much to disclose. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings, which State Department didn't like. There's a mention of political reasons and the White House trying to mediate. The summary needs to capture that tension and the implications of the edits.

I also need to keep it under 200 words. Let me outline the main points: internal jostling between State and CIA, Morell's edits, State's objections, Petraeus's dismissal, White House's role, and the political context. I should make sure to highlight the conflict and the concerns about political motivations.

I should also note that the emails were released to counter Republican claims of political interference. The summary should reflect that the process was about balancing information without compromising the investigation, but critics argue it downplayed State's security issues.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the internal conflict, the specific edits, the reasons behind them, and the broader implications. I should avoid getting too bogged down in the timeline but focus on the key decisions and the resulting criticism.

I think I've covered the main points. Let me structure it concisely, ensuring each sentence adds value and sticks to the word limit.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal conflicts over the government's talking points regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials opposed. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The process, under time pressure, involved a tug-of-war between the CIA and State Department over信息披露. Critics argue the final talking points downplayed Libya's dangerous environment, raising questions about the State Department's security posture. The White House aimed to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate, but Republicans accused the administration of politically motivated alterations. The emails highlight the struggle to balance providing facts while protecting an ongoing investigation, amid accusations of selective editing to protect the administration's image. END OF SUMMARY.
