SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points following the Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that White House officials mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA, with no evidence of political interference. Republicans claim the emails confirm the administration altered its account of the attack for political reasons, while the White House insists the process was focused on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. The release of the emails offers a rare glimpse into the White House's struggle to piece together intelligence and formulate a public account of the attack.
