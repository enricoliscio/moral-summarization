SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's talking points following the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, with Petraeus expressing dissatisfaction with the heavily scrubbed final draft. While the White House mediated between the State Department and the CIA, Republicans argue that the administration airbrushed its account for political reasons during the election campaign. The emails reveal the White House's focus on protecting an ongoing investigation and the State Department's concerns about references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. Morell removed these references, acting on his own initiative, which Petraeus objected to. The release offers a rare glimpse into the White House's struggle to formulate a public account of the attack, with various agencies and officials weighing in with concerns and edits. The final version of the talking points removed material that critics argue would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. The White House maintains that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points, but Republicans continue to question the motivations behind the changes.
