SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal struggle over the official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between then-CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by Susan Rice, the ambassador to the UN, in TV appearances. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department objected to. The final version of the talking points is stripped of material, including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters, which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans argue that the administration altered its account of the attack for political reasons during an election campaign. The emails also reveal the White House's attempts to mediate the dispute between the State Department and the CIA, under tight time constraints. The release of the emails provides a rare glimpse into the White House's response to the Benghazi attack and its efforts to formulate a public account of what happened.
END OF SUMMARY.
