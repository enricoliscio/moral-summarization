SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points following the Benghazi attack. The emails show a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying it would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it. The emails portray White House officials as being sensitive to the State Department's concerns, mediating a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose. Critics argue that the final version of the talking points was airbrushed, omitting material that would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. The release of the emails confirms that the administration had altered its account of the attack during an election campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
