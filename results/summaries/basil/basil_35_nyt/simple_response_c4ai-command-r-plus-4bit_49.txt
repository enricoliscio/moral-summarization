SUMMARY: Newly released emails from the White House reveal a fierce internal debate over the official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack, exposing a disagreement between the CIA and the State Department, as well as a divide between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to, fearing it would reflect poorly on them. The emails suggest that the White House mediated a tug-of-war between the agencies, under pressure from Capitol Hill to provide information. While the White House claims the process was focused on providing facts, critics argue that key details were omitted, raising questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans assert that the emails confirm the administration altered its account for political gain during the election campaign. The emails offer a rare glimpse into the White House's response to the Benghazi attack and their efforts to craft a public account of the tragedy. The process was driven by intelligence officials, but the final talking points were stripped of material that could have raised questions about the State Department's preparedness. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma of balancing transparency and national security, with the potential cost of lives and political reputation at stake.
