SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed internal disagreements within the Obama administration following the 2012 Benghazi attack. The emails showed a dispute between the CIA and the State Department over the talking points to be used by UN Ambassador Susan Rice in television appearances. CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell deleted references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department feared would reflect poorly on them. However, CIA Director David Petraeus dismissed the final talking points as insufficient. The White House released the emails to counter Republican accusations of a political cover-up, arguing that intelligence officials drove the debate. The emails provide a glimpse into the administration's efforts to formulate a public account of the attack, which killed four Americans. They also highlight concerns about protecting the ongoing investigation and respecting various agency equities. Republicans maintained that the emails confirmed the administration's attempt to airbrush its account of the attack.
