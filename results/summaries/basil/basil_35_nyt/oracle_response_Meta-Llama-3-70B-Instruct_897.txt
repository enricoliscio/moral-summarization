SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the September 11 attack in Benghazi, Libya. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose about CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. The State Department objected to the references, fearing they would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that White House officials mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose, all under heavy time constraints. The final version of the talking points was stripped of material, including references to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters, which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.
