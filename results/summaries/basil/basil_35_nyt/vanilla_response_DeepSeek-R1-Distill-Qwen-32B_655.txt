Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. The article is about emails released by the White House regarding internal disputes over the government's talking points after the Benghazi attack. 

I notice that the key players are David Petraeus, his deputy Michael Morell, Susan Rice, and various officials from the State Department and CIA. The main issue seems to be disagreements over what information to include in the talking points, especially regarding CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya. Morell deleted some references, which the State Department objected to, fearing it would reflect poorly on them.

Petraeus was unhappy with the final draft, saying it wouldn't satisfy a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. The White House released these emails in response to Republican claims that the administration was altering the talking points for political reasons. The emails show a tug-of-war between the State Department and CIA, with the White House trying to mediate under time pressure.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main conflicts: the internal disputes, the deletions by Morell, the State Department's objections, Petraeus's dissatisfaction, and the White House's response to Republican accusations. I should also mention that the emails didn't reveal new details about the attack but highlighted the political nature of the process.

I'll structure the summary to include the key points: the internal disputes, the deletions, the State Department's concerns, Petraeus's reaction, the White House's release of emails, and the political implications. Making sure it's clear and within the word limit is important. I'll also ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft this, keeping each sentence focused and avoiding unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. Once done, I'll present it as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disputes over the government's talking points following the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, which the State Department opposed. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The emails showed a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the State Department and CIA, with the White House mediating under time pressure. Republicans accused the administration of altering the talking points for political reasons, while the White House claimed the process focused on providing accurate information. The final version omitted details about Libya's dangerous environment, raising questions about security posture. The emails provided a rare glimpse into the decision-making process but did not reveal new details about the attack. END OF SUMMARY.
