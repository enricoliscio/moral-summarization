SUMMARY:

The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday, revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them. The emails suggest that White House officials mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose, under heavy time constraints. The release of the emails was intended to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points. However, Republicans claim that the emails confirm that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.
