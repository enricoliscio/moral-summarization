Alright, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses emails from the White House revealing internal conflicts over the talking points regarding the Benghazi attack. Key players include the State Department, CIA, and White House officials. The main issue is the alteration of talking points, particularly removing references to CIA warnings, which critics argue was done for political reasons.

I should identify the morally framed words: attack, threats, alter, mediated, killed, selectively, inaccurately, read, providing, protecting, airbrushed, threat, break, “abused”, beat.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes these terms, highlighting the internal disputes, the deletion of information, and the political implications.

I'll start by mentioning the release of emails, the internal conflict, and the deletion of CIA warnings. Then, note the political reasons and the criticism from Republicans. Include the White House's response about providing facts and protecting the investigation. Also, mention the removal of references about Libya's dangerous environment and the criticism that the administration airbrushed the account. Finally, touch on the political nature of the changes and the ongoing investigation.

Make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate without forcing them, ensuring the summary flows naturally while preserving the author's framing.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House revealed internal disputes over the government's talking points regarding the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. The State Department and CIA clashed over how much to disclose, with CIA Deputy Michael Morell deleting references to warnings about extremist threats in Libya, fearing it would reflect poorly on the State Department. CIA Director David Petraeus dismissed the final draft, calling it unsatisfactory. The process was mediated by White House aides under time pressure from Capitol Hill. Critics accused the administration of selectively and inaccurately altering the talking points for political reasons, airbrushing the account to avoid scrutiny of the State Department's security posture. Republicans claimed the changes raised questions about political motivations. The White House defended the process as focused on providing facts and protecting the investigation, but the final version omitted key details, leading to accusations of political interference. END OF SUMMARY.
