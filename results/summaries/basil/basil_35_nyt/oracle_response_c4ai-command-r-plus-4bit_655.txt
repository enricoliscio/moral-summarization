SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's talking points after the Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails showed a disagreement between the CIA and the State Department, with the CIA wanting to disclose more information about prior extremist threats in Libya and the State Department fearing this would reflect badly on them. Michael Morell, the CIA deputy director, deleted a reference to CIA warnings about these threats, but CIA Director David Petraeus objected to the final talking points, saying they would not satisfy lawmakers. The emails suggest that White House aides mediated a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the agencies, under pressure from Capitol Hill. Critics argue that the final version was stripped of material that would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture before the attack that killed four Americans, including an ambassador. Republicans welcomed the release of the emails, accusing the administration of airbrushing its account of the attack for political reasons. The White House, however, maintains that intelligence officials drove the debate over the talking points and that the process was focused on protecting the ongoing investigation while providing the facts as they were known at the time.
END OF SUMMARY.
