SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing a fierce internal debate over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack. The emails showed a disagreement between CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points. Morell deleted a reference to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, saying "Frankly, I'd just as soon not use this." The emails suggest that White House officials mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the CIA over how much to disclose, with a focus on providing the facts as they knew them. Republicans welcomed the release of the emails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. The emails raise questions about the motivations behind the changes and who at the State Department was seeking them.
