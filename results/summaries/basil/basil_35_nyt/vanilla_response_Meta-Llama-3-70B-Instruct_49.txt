SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails revealing internal debates over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack in Libya. The emails show disagreements between the State Department and the CIA, as well as within the CIA, over how much to disclose. CIA Director David Petraeus and his deputy, Michael Morell, disagreed on the level of disclosure, with Morell deleting references to CIA warnings of extremist threats in Libya. The emails also show White House officials mediating between the State Department and CIA, with a focus on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. Republicans claim the emails confirm that the administration altered its account of the attack for political reasons, while the White House argues that the emails show intelligence officials drove the debate over the talking points.
