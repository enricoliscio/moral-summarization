Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the internal emails released by the White House regarding the Benghazi attack. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about disagreements between the CIA and State Department over the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. Key players are Petraeus, Morell, Susan Rice, and the political implications.

I should identify the main events: the emails show disagreements on what to include in the talking points, Morell deleting references to CIA warnings, Petraeus disapproving, and the process under time pressure from Capitol Hill. Also, the White House's release of emails to counter Republican claims of political interference.

I need to structure the summary to include these points without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the key players, the nature of the disagreements, and the political context. Keep it under 200 words and in clear, concise English.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all essential aspects without unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Finally, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: Emails released by the White House reveal internal disputes over the government's talking points following the 2012 Benghazi attack. CIA Director David Petraeus and Deputy Michael Morell disagreed on how much to disclose, with Morell removing references to CIA warnings about extremist threats in Libya, reportedly on his own initiative. Petraeus dismissed the final draft, stating it wouldn't satisfy House Democrats. The emails show a bureaucratic tug-of-war between the State Department and CIA under time pressure from Capitol Hill. Critics argue the final talking points omitted key details, raising questions about security posture. Republicans claim the administration politically altered the narrative during the election campaign. The White House maintains the process focused on providing facts while protecting an ongoing investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
