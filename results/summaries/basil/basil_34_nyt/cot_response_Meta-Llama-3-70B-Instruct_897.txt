SUMMARY:
A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school to ensure "safety" and "security". The report suggests that the presence of armed personnel can "diminish response time" in a shooting, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman. However, gun control advocates and Democrats have criticized the report, calling it a "response to the last tragedy" and accusing the NRA of trying to "prey on America's fears" and "saturate our schools with more guns". Despite the criticism, at least one Newtown parent has expressed support for the report, calling it a "recommendation for solutions, real solutions that will make our kids safer". The report's recommendations come as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, with the NRA's influence likely to play a significant role.
