Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. The task has two parts: first, identify morally framed single words, and then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, often related to values, ethics, or judgments. For example, words like "safety," "protection," "tragedy," "criticism," etc.

Looking at the article, I should go through each sentence and pick out words that have such connotations. I'll make a list, each on a new line, prefixed with an asterisk. Words like "safety," "arming," "criticized," "massacre," "prey," "fortresses," "solutions," "protection," "background checks," "controls," "prospects," "defeated," "pushing," "revive," "expand," "mandatory," "pushing," "revive," "expand," "mandatory," "pushing," "revive," "expand," "mandatory," "pushing," "revive," "expand," "mandatory," "pushing," "revive," "expand," "mandatory," "pushing,"
