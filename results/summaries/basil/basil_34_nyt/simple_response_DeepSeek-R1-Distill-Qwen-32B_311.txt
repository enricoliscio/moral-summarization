Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article is about the NRA releasing a report advocating for arming teachers and school staff to enhance school safety. The report suggests having armed police, guards, or trained staff in every school. They argue this would improve security and response times, citing a past incident where an armed principal stopped a gunman. The moral framing here is that having armed personnel is a proactive step to protect students, framing it as a necessary measure for safety.

On the other hand, the article mentions criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats. They argue that arming teachers isn't a solution and could lead to more violence. This perspective frames the NRA's proposal as dangerous and not addressing the root causes of gun violence, suggesting it's a knee-jerk reaction to past tragedies.

There's also support from a Newtown parent, indicating that some affected individuals see this as a viable solution, emphasizing the need for real safety measures regardless of politics. This adds a moral angle of prioritizing children's safety over political debates.

The summary needs to capture both sides: the NRA's stance as a proactive safety measure and the critics' view as promoting fear and more guns. It should also mention the political context, like the upcoming Senate debate and President Obama's push for background checks, highlighting the lobbying power of the NRA.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without losing the moral perspectives. I'll structure it by first introducing the report, then the arguments for and against, and end with the political implications.

Let me make sure to include key details like the 225-page report, the specific recommendations, the Mississippi case, the criticism from Thompson and Edelman, the support from the Newtown parent, and the legislative context. I'll also note the NRA's influence and the potential for divided opinions.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or trained staff in every U.S. school, arguing this would enhance safety and reduce response times in emergencies. The report, unveiled amid tight security, cites a 1997 case where an armed principal stopped a gunman. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue arming teachers is a knee-jerk reaction to past tragedies and could lead to more violence. Representative Mike Thompson criticized the proposal as ineffective, while Marian Wright Edelman called it a fear-driven push to militarize schools. However, a Newtown parent whose child was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre supported the plan, emphasizing the need for real solutions to protect children. At least one state, Indiana, is considering armed officers in schools. The report also calls for federal grants and training programs, but its implementation and costs remain unclear. The timing of the report coincides with upcoming Senate debates on gun control, with President Obama pushing for expanded background checks, while the NRAâ€™s lobbying influence remains strong. END OF SUMMARY.
