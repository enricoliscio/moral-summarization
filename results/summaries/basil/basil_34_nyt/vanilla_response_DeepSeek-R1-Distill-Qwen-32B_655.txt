Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about a report released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) task force suggesting that schools should have armed personnel, including police, guards, or staff. They want states to make it easier for teachers and administrators to carry guns. They presented this at a press conference with heavy security, which is notable.

The report's key point is that armed security can reduce response time in case of a shooting. They referenced a 1997 case in Mississippi where an assistant principal stopped a gunman. However, this recommendation has been criticized by gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers isn't the solution. They mention previous tragedies in malls and theaters, suggesting that arming everyone isn't the answer.

Supporters include a parent from Newtown, whose child was killed, who thinks politics should be set aside for real solutions. The report also suggests training for armed personnel and security plans for schools. However, it's unclear how these recommendations will be implemented or funded.

The timing is important because the Senate is about to debate gun control. President Obama is pushing for stricter background checks, but the NRA's influence makes it tough for such legislation to pass.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the report's main recommendations, the criticism, support, and the political context. I'll make sure to include key points without getting too detailed.
