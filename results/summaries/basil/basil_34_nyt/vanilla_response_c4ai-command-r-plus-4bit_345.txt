SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association-funded task force released a report recommending armed guards or staff in every American school to improve school safety. The report, unveiled by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, also suggested loosening gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. The recommendations were met with criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers is not a solution to gun violence. However, the report received support from at least one Newtown parent, who called for setting aside politics and focusing on solutions to make schools safer. The task force also called for improved coordination between federal agencies and grant funding for schools to enhance security measures. The announcement comes as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, including expanded background checks for gun buyers. The report reflects the rifle association's influence as a lobbying force, but the prospects for tough new gun control laws remain uncertain.
