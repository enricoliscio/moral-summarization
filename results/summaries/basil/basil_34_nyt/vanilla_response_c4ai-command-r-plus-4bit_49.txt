SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association-funded task force released a report recommending armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school. The report, unveiled by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, cites a 1997 case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman with a pistol as evidence that armed security adds a layer of protection and reduces response time. The recommendations have been criticized by gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers and school staff is not a comprehensive solution to gun violence. The task force's independence from the NRA has been questioned, and critics argue that schools should not be turned into armed fortresses. However, the report received support from at least one Newtown parent, who called for politics to be set aside in favor of real solutions. The task force also called for improved coordination between government agencies and recommended a training course for armed personnel developed by the NRA. The timing of the announcement coincides with Congress's upcoming debate on gun control legislation, including background checks for gun buyers.
