SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school to enhance safety and diminish response time in the event of a shooting. The report also urges states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. Critics argue that arming teachers is merely a response to the last tragedy and that it would lead to saturating schools with more guns, turning them into armed fortresses. However, some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, see the report as a plan for real solutions to make kids safer. The task force also calls for the Departments of Homeland Security, Education, and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks. The report's recommendations have sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a continuation of the NRA's attempts to prey on America's fears.
