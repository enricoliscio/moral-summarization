Okay, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to understand the task. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My job is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

The user has broken this down into two steps. The first step is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. They want me to list these words with each on a new line starting with an asterisk. The second step is to write a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, using as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Looking at the article, it's about the NRA's report advocating for armed personnel in schools. The moral framing here likely revolves around safety, security, fear, responsibility, and the effectiveness of policies. Words like "safety," "security," "fear," "response," "solution," "protection," "checks," and "controls" come to mind as they carry moral connotations.

I'll go through the article again to pick out these words. The article mentions "safety," "security," "fear," "response," "solution," "protection," "checks," and "controls." These words are central to the moral arguments presented by both the NRA and their critics.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while incorporating these words. The summary should highlight the NRA's proposal, the criticism it received, and the broader context of gun control debates. I'll make sure to include the key points: the report's recommendations, the criticism from gun control advocates, the support from some Newtown parents, and the legislative context.

I should also mention the potential costs and the political backdrop, including President Obama's stance and the NRA's influence. Keeping it concise is crucial, so I'll focus on the main arguments and reactions without getting bogged down in details.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. The summary should reflect the moral framing by emphasizing the differing viewpoints on safety, responsibility, and the effectiveness of arming schools versus stricter gun controls.

**SUMMARY:**  

A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has recommended arming teachers, staff, and police in schools to enhance safety and security, citing faster response times in emergencies. Critics argue this approach merely reacts to past tragedies and could turn schools into armed fortresses, exploiting fears of violence. Gun control advocates, including Democrats, oppose the plan, emphasizing the need for stricter gun controls rather than arming schools. The report, however, received support from some Newtown parents, who prioritize real solutions for child safety. The proposal faces unclear prospects in Congress, where President Obama advocates for expanded background checks, while the NRA remains a powerful lobbying force against stricter controls. The debate highlights competing priorities: balancing security with preventing gun violence.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
