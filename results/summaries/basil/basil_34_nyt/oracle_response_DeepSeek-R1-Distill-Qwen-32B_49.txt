Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the NRA's report advocating for armed personnel in schools, the criticism it received, and the political context around gun control.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the report's recommendations, the reactions from both supporters and critics, and the broader implications. I need to make sure to include words like "safety," "armed," "security," "shooting," "massacre," "tragedy," etc., as specified.

I'll structure the summary by introducing the report, its recommendations, the criticism it faced, and the support it received. I should also mention the political timing and the potential impact on school safety. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically.

I'll begin with the report's release, then move to the recommendations, followed by the criticism and support. I'll conclude with the political context and the potential outcomes. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the words are included. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or staff in every U.S. school, aiming to enhance safety and reduce response times during shootings. The report, unveiled amid heightened security, cites cases like a 1997 Mississippi incident where an armed assistant principal stopped a gunman. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue that arming teachers and staff is a reactive measure to past tragedies, such as the Sandy Hook massacre, and risks turning schools into armed fortresses. The NRA’s plan, while supported by some Newtown parents, faces opposition for potentially saturating schools with guns and diverting attention from broader solutions. The report also calls for expanded police presence, training for armed personnel, and state-mandated security plans. However, its implementation and costs remain unclear. The timing of the report coincides with congressional debates on gun control, highlighting the ongoing tension between safety and the NRA’s influence. END OF SUMMARY.
