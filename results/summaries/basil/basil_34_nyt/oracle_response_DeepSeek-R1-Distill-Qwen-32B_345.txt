Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the NRA's report advocating for armed personnel in schools, the criticism it received, and the potential impact on school safety.

The author uses words like "safety," "armed," "security," "killed," "massacre," "tragedy," and others that carry moral weight. My goal is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without losing the essence of the article.

I should start by identifying the key events: the release of the NRA report, the recommendations, the criticism from gun control advocates, and the support from a Newtown parent. I also need to mention the potential implementation in states like Indiana and the upcoming Senate debate on gun control.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the report, then outline the recommendations, followed by the criticism and support, and finally touch on the political implications. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and within 200 words. I'll check that all the key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved through the chosen words.

SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or staff in every U.S. school to enhance safety and diminish response times during shootings. The report, unveiled amid heightened security, emphasizes the presence of armed personnel as a critical layer of security, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an armed assistant principal subdued a gunman. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue that arming teachers and staff is a reactive measure to past tragedies, such as the Sandy Hook massacre, and could turn schools into armed fortresses. Marian Wright Edelman of the Children’s Defense Fund condemned the plan as a continuation of the NRA’s strategy to prey on fears and saturate schools with guns. However, some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, support the recommendations as real solutions to make schools safer. At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea. The report also calls for training programs and security plans, but implementation details and costs remain unclear. The timing of the report coincides with upcoming Senate debates on gun control, with President Obama pushing for stricter background checks and an assault weapons ban, though such measures face strong opposition from the NRA.
