SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association (NRA)-funded task force released a report recommending armed guards or staff in every American school to improve security and reduce response time in shootings. The report, unveiled by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, faced criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats who argue that more guns are not the solution to gun violence. The report received support from at least one Newtown parent, Mark Mattioli, who lost his son in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The task force called for coordination between federal agencies and grant money to improve school safety and develop security plans. It also recommended a 40- to 60-hour training course for armed staff, to be developed by the NRA. The announcement comes as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, including expanded background checks for gun buyers. The NRA's influence as a lobbying force may impact the outcome of the legislation.
