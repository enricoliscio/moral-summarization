SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a 225-page report recommending that armed police officers, security guards, or staff members be present in every American school to improve safety. The report also suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. The NRA's executive director, Wayne LaPierre, announced the plan to put armed guards in every school after the Newtown shooting. Critics argue that arming teachers is not a solution to gun violence, while some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, support the idea. The report also recommends that the Departments of Homeland Security, Education, and Justice coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks. The timing of the report's release coincides with the upcoming Senate debate on gun control.
