SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a report recommending that every American school have armed police officers, security guards, or staff members to ensure safety. The report also urges states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. Critics argue that this approach is misguided and that arming teachers is not a solution to gun violence. They point out that the focus should be on tightening gun restrictions, not increasing the presence of guns in schools. However, some, like Mark Mattioli, a Newtown parent who lost his son in the Sandy Hook massacre, support the report's recommendations as a way to make schools safer. The report's timing is seen as an attempt to influence the upcoming Senate debate on gun control, which is expected to consider legislation on background checks and assault weapons.

END OF SUMMARY.
