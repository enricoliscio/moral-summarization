Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has given me a list of morally framed words that I should include. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about the NRA releasing a report suggesting arming schools with police, guards, or trained staff. They argue this would enhance safety and reduce response times in shootings. The report mentions a case where an assistant principal stopped a gunman, which supports their argument. However, gun control advocates criticize this approach, calling it a knee-jerk reaction to past tragedies. They worry it might turn schools into armed fortresses. Some, like a Newtown parent, support the idea for real solutions to protect kids. The report also suggests training for armed personnel and security plans, but implementation details are unclear. The timing is strategic as Congress is about to debate gun control, with Obama pushing for background checks, but the NRA's influence makes stricter laws unlikely.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words: safety, armed, security, diminishes, shooting, killed, massacre, tragedy, plan, put, continuation, prey, saturate, turn, namecalling, safer, efforts, prevent, respond, attacks, plans. I'll structure the summary to touch on each of these points, ensuring the moral perspective is maintained.

I should start by introducing the NRA's report and its main recommendations, highlighting the moral arguments for safety. Then, mention the criticism, using words like 'prey' and'saturate' to show opponents' concerns. Include the Newtown parent's support, emphasizing'safer' and'solutions.' Finally, note the political context and the potential for implementation, tying it back to the moral debate around gun control.

SUMMARY:  
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or staff in schools to enhance safety and reduce response times during shootings. The report, led by Asa Hutchinson, cites a case where an armed assistant principal stopped a gunman, but critics argue arming teachers is a knee-jerk reaction to past tragedies like Sandy Hook. Gun control advocates warn this approach could "saturate" schools with guns, turning them into "armed fortresses." While some, like a Newtown parent, support the plan as a "real solution" to make schools safer, others, including Democrats, criticize it as a "continuation" of the NRA's efforts to "prey" on fears. The report also calls for training and security plans, but implementation details remain unclear. With Congress set to debate gun control, President Obama is pushing for expanded background checks, though stricter laws face resistance from the NRA's lobbying power. END OF SUMMARY.
