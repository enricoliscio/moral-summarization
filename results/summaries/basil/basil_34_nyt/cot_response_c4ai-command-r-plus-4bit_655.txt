SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report recommending the presence of armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school. The report, led by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, suggests that armed security personnel add a layer of safety and reduce response time in the event of a shooting. The recommendations have been met with criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers and school staff is not the proper response to gun violence. Despite the criticism, the report has gained support from at least one Newtown parent, who believes that political differences should be set aside in favor of implementing solutions that will make schools safer for children. The task force also calls for improved coordination between federal agencies and grant money to help schools assess their security measures and response plans. With Congress set to debate gun control legislation, the timing of the report is significant. The NRA's influence as a lobbying force is expected to impact the outcome of any proposed gun control measures, including background check expansion and assault weapons ban revival.
