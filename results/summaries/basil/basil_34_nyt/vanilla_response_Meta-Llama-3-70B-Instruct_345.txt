SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a 225-page report recommending that every American school have armed police officers, security guards, or staff members to improve safety. The report also suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. The NRA claims that the presence of armed security personnel adds a layer of security and diminishes response time in a shooting. However, gun control advocates and Democrats have criticized the report, arguing that it is not a solution to gun violence. The report's recommendations have received support from at least one Newtown parent, but the cost and implementation of the proposals are unclear. The report's release comes as the Senate is set to debate gun control this month, with President Obama pushing for tough new controls on gun ownership.

END OF SUMMARY.
