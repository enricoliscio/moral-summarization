SUMMARY:
In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, a National Rifle Association (NRA) task force released a report recommending the presence of armed security personnel and the loosening of gun restrictions in schools across America. The report, unveiled by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, faced immediate *criticism* from gun control advocates and Democrats who are *fighting* for tighter gun restrictions. The report suggested that armed guards would provide *safety* and reduce response time in school shootings, citing a past incident in Mississippi as evidence. However, Representative Mike Thompson countered that arming teachers is not a sustainable solution, as shootings occur in various public spaces. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, also *criticized* the report as an attempt to saturate schools with guns and create armed fortresses. Despite the *criticism*, the report received support from a Newtown parent who urged for *solutions* to keep children safe. The task force called for a 40- to 60-hour training course for armed officers or employees, developed by the NRA, and urged states to mandate schools to have *security* plans in place. The timing of the announcement coincides with the Senate's upcoming debate on gun control legislation, including the controversial *assault* weapons ban and *mandatory* background checks for gun buyers.
