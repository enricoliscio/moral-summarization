SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, a National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a report recommending the presence of armed security personnel and the loosening of gun restrictions in schools across America. Led by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, the report suggests that armed individuals in schools add a layer of safety and reduce response time in the event of a shooting. However, the recommendations have faced criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats who argue that arming teachers and staff is not a proper solution to gun violence. Despite the criticism, the report has gained support from at least one Newtown parent who pleads for politics to be set aside in favor of real solutions for the safety of children. The task force calls for coordinated efforts between federal agencies and grant money to improve school security plans and training for armed personnel. With Congress set to resume after its spring recess, the debate on gun legislation, including mandatory background checks and assault weapons restrictions, will take center stage.
