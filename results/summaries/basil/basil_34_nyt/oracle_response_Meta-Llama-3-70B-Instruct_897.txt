SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending that armed police officers, security guards, or staff members be present in every American school to enhance safety and security. The report suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman who had killed two students. The recommendations have drawn criticism from gun control advocates, who argue that arming teachers is not a solution to tragedies like the Sandy Hook massacre. Critics see the report as a continuation of the NRA's attempts to prey on America's fears and saturate schools with more guns, turning them into armed fortresses. However, some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, support the report as a plan to make schools safer. The task force also recommends that the Departments of Homeland Security, Education, and Justice coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks.
