SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school to ensure safety and diminish response time in case of a shooting. The report suggests loosening gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman who had killed two students. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue that arming teachers is not a solution to tragedies like the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. They claim it would lead to saturating schools with more guns, turning them into armed fortresses, and preying on America's fears. However, at least one Newtown parent supports the plan, calling for politics to be set aside and focusing on real solutions to make kids safer. The report's recommendations include expanding police presence in schools, providing grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks, and requiring schools to develop security plans.
