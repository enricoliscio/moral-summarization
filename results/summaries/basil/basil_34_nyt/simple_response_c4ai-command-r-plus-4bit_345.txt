SUMMARY: With the Senate debating gun control, a National Rifle Association (NRA)-funded task force has released a report recommending armed guards or staff in every school. The report, unveiled by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, faced criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats who want stricter gun laws after the Sandy Hook tragedy. The task force's recommendations, including increased police presence and mandatory security plans for schools, are supported by some Newtown parents but criticized by gun control advocates as a fear-mongering tactic by the NRA. Indiana is considering the proposal, and Congress is expected to discuss gun legislation upon their return. The report's timing is strategic, as President Obama pushes for tougher gun control measures, but the prospects for success are uncertain due to the NRA's lobbying power. The debate centers on the moral question of whether more guns can truly lead to safer schools.
