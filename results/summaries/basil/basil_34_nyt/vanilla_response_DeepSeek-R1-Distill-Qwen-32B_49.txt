Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about the NRA releasing a report suggesting armed personnel in schools. They want police, guards, or trained staff with guns. They mentioned a case where an assistant principal stopped a shooter. Critics, like Democrats and gun control advocates, are against this, saying it's just reacting to past tragedies. Some support it, like a Newtown parent. Indiana is considering it. The report also suggests training and security plans, but the cost and implementation are unclear. The Senate is about to debate gun control, and Obama is pushing for background checks, but the NRA's influence might block stricter laws.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the NRA's report, its recommendations, the criticism, support, state actions, and the political context.

Let me structure it: start with the report's recommendations, mention the criticism and support, state actions, and the political debate. Keep it concise.

I think that covers all the essential parts without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to mention the key players and the opposing views.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or trained staff in schools to enhance safety, a move criticized by gun control advocates. The report, led by Asa Hutchinson, highlights the importance of armed security to reduce response times in active shooter scenarios, citing a 1997 case in Mississippi. Critics argue this approach is a reactive measure to past tragedies and could militarize schools. Some, including a Newtown parent, support the idea as a proactive safety measure. Indiana is considering requiring armed officers in schools, while the report also calls for training and security plans. The recommendations come as Congress prepares to debate gun control, with President Obama pushing for expanded background checks, though NRA influence may hinder stricter laws. END OF SUMMARY.
