SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association task force released a report recommending armed guards or staff in every American school to improve security and reduce response time in shootings. The report was unveiled by Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman from Arkansas, and included a call for states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. The recommendations were criticized by gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers is not a solution to gun violence. The report received support from at least one Newtown parent, Mark Mattioli, who lost his son in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The task force also called for coordination between federal agencies and grant money to improve school safety. The announcement comes as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, including expanded background checks for gun buyers. The prospects for tough new gun control laws remain uncertain due to the lobbying power of the National Rifle Association.
