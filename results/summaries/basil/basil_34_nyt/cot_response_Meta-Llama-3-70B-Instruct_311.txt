SUMMARY:
A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending that armed police officers, security guards, or staff members be present in every American school to ensure "safety" and "security". The report suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman. However, gun control advocates and Democrats have criticized the report, calling it a "response to the last tragedy" and accusing the NRA of trying to "prey on America's fears" and turn schools into "armed fortresses". Despite the criticism, at least one Newtown parent has expressed support for the report, calling for "solutions" to make schools "safer". The report's recommendations come as the Senate prepares to debate gun control this month. END OF SUMMARY.
