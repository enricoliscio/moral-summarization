Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's report on school safety. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to get the main points.

The article talks about the NRA releasing a report recommending armed personnel in schools. They suggest trained teachers or staff carrying guns. The report was presented by Asa Hutchinson, and there was criticism from gun control advocates. They argue that this approach is just a reaction to recent tragedies and not a comprehensive solution.

I should include the key points: the NRA's recommendations, the criticism from both sides, the support from a Newtown parent, and the political context with Congress considering gun control. Also, mention the timing of the report as the Senate debates gun control.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it reflects the moral arguments from both sides. So, I'll structure it by introducing the report, its recommendations, the criticism, the support, and the political implications. That should cover the main moral framing without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
The National Rifle Association (NRA) released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or staff in schools, citing faster response times in emergencies. Critics argue this approach is a knee-jerk reaction to recent tragedies and risks turning schools into armed fortresses. Gun control advocates, including Democrats, oppose the plan, while some Newtown parents, like Mark Mattioli, support it as a potential solution. The report also recommends expanding police presence and training for armed personnel, but its implementation and costs remain uncertain. The timing aligns with Congress's upcoming debate on gun control, with President Obama pushing for stricter background checks, though NRA lobbying may hinder progress. END OF SUMMARY.
