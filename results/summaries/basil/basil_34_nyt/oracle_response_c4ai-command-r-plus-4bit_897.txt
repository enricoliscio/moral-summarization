SUMMARY: A report from a National Rifle Association task force recommends arming police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school to improve safety and security. The report also suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. The task force, led by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, cites a 1997 case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman with his own weapon as evidence that armed security personnel can diminish response time and save lives. The recommendations have been criticized by gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers is not a comprehensive solution to gun violence. However, at least one Newtown parent and the state of Indiana support the idea. The task force calls for coordinated efforts between federal agencies and grant money to assist schools in improving their security measures and developing plans to prevent and respond to attacks. The report's release comes as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, including background checks for gun buyers.
