SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending that armed police officers, security guards, or staff members be present in every American school to enhance safety and security. The report suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman. Critics argue that arming teachers is merely a response to the last tragedy and would lead to saturating schools with more guns, turning them into armed fortresses. The report's recommendations have drawn immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who are fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The report's supporters, including a Newtown parent who lost his son, see it as a plan for real solutions to make kids safer. The task force's recommendations will be debated in Congress, where the prospects for gun legislation are murky.
