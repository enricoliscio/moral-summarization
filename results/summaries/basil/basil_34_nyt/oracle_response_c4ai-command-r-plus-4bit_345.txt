SUMMARY: In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report recommending the presence of armed security personnel in every American school. The report argues that armed security adds a layer of safety and diminishes response time in the event of a shooting. The recommendations have drawn criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers and staff members is not a comprehensive solution to gun violence. The report has received support from at least one Newtown parent, who believes that politics should be set aside in favor of implementing solutions that will make schools safer. The timing of the report's release coincides with the upcoming Senate debate on gun control legislation, which is expected to include measures such as expanded background checks for gun buyers. The NRA's influence as a lobbying force has made the prospects for tough new gun control laws murky.
