SUMMARY:
A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending that armed police officers, security guards, or staff members be present in every American school to ensure safety and security. The report suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, have condemned the report as a attempt to "prey on America's fears" and "saturate our schools with more guns." However, some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, support the report's "real solutions" to make schools safer. The report's recommendations come as the Senate prepares to debate gun control this month, with President Obama pushing for tough new controls on gun ownership. END OF SUMMARY.
