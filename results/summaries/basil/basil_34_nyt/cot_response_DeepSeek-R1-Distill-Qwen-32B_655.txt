Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the NRA's report on arming schools. First, I should go through the article to identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about the NRA's recommendations, which include arming teachers and having armed police in schools. Words like "loosen gun restrictions," "arming," "safety," "massacre," "prey on fears," "armed fortresses," "real solutions," "politics," "name-calling," "protection," "mandatory background checks," "tough new controls," "lobbying force," and "revive and revamp" stand out as having moral connotations. These words reflect the opposing views on gun control and school safety.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include these morally framed words. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the debate. I'll start by mentioning the NRA's report and its recommendations, then touch on the criticism from gun control advocates, and include the support from a Newtown parent. I'll also note the political context and the potential for legislative action.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the key points without getting too bogged down in details. I'll make sure to preserve the moral framing by using the identified words appropriately. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each part of the summary addresses a main point from the article.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that it accurately reflects the moral perspectives presented in the original article. I'll check for clarity and coherence, making sure the summary is both informative and concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has recommended arming schools with armed police, guards, or trained staff to enhance safety, citing cases like the 1997 Mississippi shooting where an armed assistant principal stopped a gunman. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue that arming teachers is a reactive measure to past tragedies, such as the Sandy Hook massacre, and could turn schools into armed fortresses. Marian Wright Edelman of the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund accused the NRA of exploiting fears. However, Mark Mattioli, a Newtown parent, supported the plan, calling for real solutions to protect children. At least one state, Indiana, is considering armed officers in schools. The report also calls for federal coordination and funding for school security, with training courses developed by the NRA. The recommendations come as Congress prepares to debate gun legislation, with President Obama pushing for mandatory background checks, though NRA lobbying may hinder stricter controls. The debate highlights competing views on safety, fear, and the role of guns in public spaces.
