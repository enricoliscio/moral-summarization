Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a report released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) task force. They want armed police, guards, or staff in every school. They also suggest loosening gun laws so teachers and admins can carry weapons. Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman, presented the report at a press conference with heavy security. He used a 1997 case where an assistant principal stopped a gunman as an example.

Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, oppose this. They think it's just a reaction to recent tragedies and not a real solution. They mention other incidents in malls and theaters, suggesting arming everyone isn't the answer. Some support, like a Newtown parent, says it's about finding real solutions. Indiana is considering the idea. The task force wants more coordination between federal departments and training for armed staff. The report's timing is strategic as Congress is about to debate gun control. President Obama wants stricter background checks, but the NRA's influence makes it uncertain.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the report's recommendations, the presentation details, the criticism, support, state actions, and the political context.

Let me structure it: start with the report and its main points, mention the presentation and example, then the criticism and support, state actions, and the political backdrop. Keep it concise, ensuring all important elements are included without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has released a report advocating for armed police, guards, or staff in every U.S. school, urging states to ease gun restrictions to allow trained educators to carry weapons. The report, presented by former Arkansas Congressman Asa Hutchinson, highlights the importance of armed security to reduce response times during school shootings, citing a 1997 case where an assistant principal stopped a gunman. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue this approach is merely a reaction to recent tragedies and not a comprehensive solution. Some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, support the idea as a potential safety measure. Indiana is considering requiring armed officers in schools, while the task force also calls for federal coordination and training programs for armed staff. The report's release coincides with Congress's upcoming debate on gun control, with President Obama pushing for expanded background checks, though the NRA's lobbying influence may hinder legislation.
