SUMMARY: With the Senate debating gun control, a National Rifle Association-funded task force has released a report recommending armed officers or staff in every American school and looser gun restrictions for trained teachers and administrators. The report, led by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, cites the reduced response time of an armed presence as a key benefit, referencing a 1997 case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman. The recommendations have been criticized by gun control advocates and Democrats as a reactionary response to the last tragedy, and as an attempt by the rifle association to prey on fears and turn schools into armed fortresses. However, the report has gained support from at least one Newtown parent, who hopes for real solutions to make kids safer. The task force calls for coordinated school safety efforts and grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks. It recommends a rifle association-developed training course for armed officers or employees and urges states to require schools to develop security plans. The cost and implementation of these recommendations are uncertain, but the timing of the announcement is intended to influence upcoming gun legislation debates in Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
