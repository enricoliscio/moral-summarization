SUMMARY:
A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school to ensure "safety" and "security". The report suggests that the presence of armed personnel can "diminish response time" in a shooting. However, critics argue that this approach is a "tragedy" and that it will lead to "fear" and "prey" on America's fears. The report's recommendations have been met with criticism from gun control advocates, who see it as an attempt to "saturate" schools with more guns and turn them into "armed fortresses". Despite this, some, like Mark Mattioli, a Newtown parent who lost his son, see the report as a "real solution" to make schools "safer". The report's release comes as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, with the NRA's influence likely to play a significant role. END OF SUMMARY.
