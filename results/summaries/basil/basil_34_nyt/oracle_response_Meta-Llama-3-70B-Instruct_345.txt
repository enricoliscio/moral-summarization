SUMMARY:

A National Rifle Association task force has released a report calling for armed police officers, security guards, or staff members in every American school to ensure safety and diminish response time in the event of a shooting. The report recommends that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman who had killed two students. However, gun control advocates and Democrats have criticized the report, arguing that it is a continuation of the NRA's attempts to prey on America's fears and saturate schools with more guns, turning them into armed fortresses. The report's recommendations have sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a plan to make schools safer, while others view it as a response to the last tragedy, rather than a comprehensive solution to prevent attacks. The debate comes as Congress prepares to consider gun legislation, with President Obama pushing for tougher controls on gun ownership.
