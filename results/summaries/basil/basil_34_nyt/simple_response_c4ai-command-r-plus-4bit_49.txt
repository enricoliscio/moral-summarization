SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association-funded task force released a report recommending armed guards or staff in every American school, citing safety concerns. The report has drawn criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that more guns are not the solution to gun violence. The timing of the report is significant as the Senate is set to debate gun control this month. The report's recommendations, including increased security presence and improved safety plans, have been criticized by some as a continuation of the NRA's agenda to saturate schools with guns. However, at least one Newtown parent has expressed support for the recommendations, calling for politics to be set aside in favor of real solutions. The task force panel has also called for coordination between federal agencies and grant money to help schools improve security. The report highlights the ongoing debate between those who believe that more guns will improve safety and those who advocate for tighter gun restrictions to reduce gun violence in schools and other public spaces.
