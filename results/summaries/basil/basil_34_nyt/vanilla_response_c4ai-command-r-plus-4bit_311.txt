SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association-funded task force released a report recommending armed officers or staff in every American school to enhance security and reduce response time in shootings. The report also advised states to relax gun laws to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. The study was unveiled by former Republican congressman Asa Hutchinson, who led the task force. The recommendations received criticism from gun control advocates and Democrats, who argue that arming teachers is not a comprehensive solution to gun violence. However, at least one Newtown parent supported the idea, calling for politics to be set aside in favor of practical solutions. The task force also called for improved coordination between federal agencies and grant funding for schools to assess their security measures. The report's release comes as Congress prepares to debate gun control legislation, including expanded background checks for gun buyers. The prospects for tougher gun control laws remain uncertain due to the lobbying power of the National Rifle Association.
