SUMMARY:
A National Rifle Association task force has released a report recommending that armed police officers, security guards, or staff members be present in every American school to ensure "safety" and "security". The report suggests that states loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons, citing a 1997 Mississippi case where an assistant principal subdued a gunman. Critics argue that this approach is a misguided response to "tragedy" and would lead to schools becoming "armed fortresses". Supporters, including a Newtown parent who lost his son, see this as a necessary step to make schools "safer". The report's recommendations have sparked controversy, with some accusing the NRA of trying to "prey" on America's "fears". The debate comes as Congress prepares to consider gun control legislation.
