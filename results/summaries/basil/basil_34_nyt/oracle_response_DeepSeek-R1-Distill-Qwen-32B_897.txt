Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about the NRA releasing a report suggesting arming schools with police, guards, or staff. They argue this would increase safety and reduce response times in case of shootings. 

The user wants a summary that keeps the morally charged words like safety, armed, security, etc. I should make sure to include those terms. Also, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by identifying the key points: the report's recommendations, the criticism from gun control advocates, the support from a Newtown parent, and the political context with Congress and President Obama's stance. 

I need to ensure that each of these points is covered succinctly, using the moral terms. For example, when mentioning the criticism, I'll use words like "prey on fears" and "saturate schools with guns." I'll also highlight the argument that this is a response to the last tragedy, which is a moral criticism.

I should also include the support from the parent and the political implications, like the NRA's lobbying power and the potential for legislation. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow from the report's recommendations, through the criticisms, to the support and political context. Keeping each sentence tight and focused on the moral framing. 

Let me make sure I'm not exceeding the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's necessary and contributes to the overall summary without unnecessary details. 

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all the key morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

SUMMARY: A National Rifle Association (NRA) task force has recommended arming schools with police officers, security guards, or trained staff to enhance safety and reduce response times during shootings. The report, unveiled amid heightened security, argues that armed personnel could prevent tragedies like the 1997 Mississippi school shooting. Critics, including gun control advocates and Democrats, argue this approach merely responds to the latest tragedy, rather than addressing broader gun control issues. Representative Mike Thompson criticized the plan as a continuation of the NRA’s strategy to prey on fears and saturate schools with guns. However, some, like Newtown parent Mark Mattioli, support the proposal, calling it a real solution to make schools safer. The report also calls for coordinated federal efforts to prevent and respond to school attacks, with states requiring security plans and training for armed personnel. While at least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea, the implementation and cost remain unclear. The timing of the report coincides with Congress’s upcoming debate on gun legislation, with President Obama pushing for expanded background checks, though the NRA’s lobbying influence makes major reforms uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
