Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a student, which was caught on video. He later apologized, but there's some political context involved too.

The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words in the article. I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "profoundly sorry," "apologized," "confrontation," "tussle," "partisan," "excuse," "snatching," "grabbing," "spat," "pushed," "threatened," "unbecoming," "assault," "beyond the pale," "confrontation," "running for re-election," "predicted," "likely hold on to his seat," "voted in favor," "health care overhaul," "cap-and-trade," and "opponents." These words all carry some moral weight, indicating approval or disapproval.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating that Etheridge apologized for the confrontation. I'll mention the video showing him grabbing the student and the context of the student asking about the Obama agenda. I'll note that Etheridge said he regrets the incident, even though he's been spat at and threatened before. I'll include the conservative blogger's criticism that his actions were unbecoming and part of Obama's assault on jobs. Finally, I'll mention his political background and the upcoming election, where he's expected to win despite the incident.

I have to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll make sure it's concise but includes all the key moral points. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the apology, the incident details, the consequences, and the political implications.

**SUMMARY:**  
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge apologized for a physical confrontation with a student on a Washington street, captured in a viral video. Etheridge, a Democrat, was seen grabbing the student's wrist and neck after the student questioned his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge acknowledged that his actions were "profoundly" regrettable, though he had not apologized directly to the student, citing not knowing their identity. The incident occurred after a "long day," but Etheridge admitted that "no excuse" justified his response. Conservative critics, including blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's behavior as "unbecoming" of a congressman, linking it to his support for Obama's policies. Etheridge, who has served since 1997, is running for re-election and is expected to retain his seat despite the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
