Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a confrontation with a student. There's a video showing him grabbing the student's wrist and neck. Etheridge apologized, saying he regrets the incident. The author uses words like "confrontation," "tussle," "grabbing," "response," "incident," "grab," "spat," "pushed," "threatened," "conduct," and "assault." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the video surfaced three days ago, showing Etheridge grabbing the student. The student approached him about the "Obama agenda." Etheridge tried to snatch the camera, then grabbed the student's wrist and neck. He later apologized, saying he regrets the incident but hasn't apologized to the student because he doesn't know who they are. Critics, including a conservative blogger, condemned his conduct as unbecoming for a congressman, especially given his support for Obama's policies. He's running for re-election, and political observers think he'll keep his seat.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to include all the morally framed words and keep it under 200 words. I'll mention the confrontation, the tussle, the grabbing, his response, the incident, the grabs, spat, pushed, threatened, conduct, and assault. I'll also include the context about his political stance and the election.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary details without being too verbose. I'll avoid any additional analysis beyond what's in the article and stick to the facts while using the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: Three days after a video surfaced showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge in a confrontation with a young man, the lawmaker issued a written statement apologizing for the tussle. The video, posted to YouTube, shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of a student who approached him and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge denied knowing the identity of the men involved, stating he would apologize if he knew who they were. He acknowledged that his response was unacceptable, despite being spat at, pushed, and threatened before. Critics, including conservative blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's conduct as unbecoming of a member of Congress, particularly given his support for Obama's policies. Etheridge, who has served since 1997, is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers. END OF SUMMARY.
