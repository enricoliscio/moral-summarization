Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the task.

The user provided a news article about Rep. Bob Etheridge and a confrontation. They want me to do two things: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and second, write a summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "profoundly," "apologized," "sorry," "tussle," "confrontation," "excuse," "regrets," "incident," "snatching," "grabbing," "spat," "pushed," "threatened," "unbecoming," "assault," "beyond the pale," "running," "re-election," "predicted," "hold," "seat," "voted," "favored," "health care overhaul," "climate change bill," "opponents," "cap-and-trade." I'll list each of these with a *.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral elements. I'll mention Etheridge apologizing, the incident details, his explanation, the criticism, and his political situation. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words as much as possible without making it sound forced.

I should also check that the summary flows naturally and covers all key points: the event, his apology, the context of the fundraiser, the criticism from the blogger, his political stance, and his re-election chances.

Let me structure it: start with the apology, describe the incident, his reasons, the criticism, his political background, and the impact on his campaign. Make sure to include the moral words like "profoundly sorry," "tussle," "excuse," "unbecoming," "assault," "beyond the pale," etc.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rep. Bob Etheridge, a North Carolina Democrat, apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, calling it "profoundly" regrettable. The incident, captured in a viral video, showed Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man asked about his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge claimed he didn't know the man's identity and hasn't apologized directly, citing a "long day" as context. Critics, including conservative blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's actions as "unbecoming" of a congressman and part of his broader opposition to North Carolina jobs. The video, filmed outside a fundraiser for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sparked controversy as Etheridge faces re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers. Etheridge, a long-serving congressman, supports Obama's health care and climate change policies, though his conduct has drawn criticism. His political career remains stable, but the incident has raised questions about his behavior and judgment.
