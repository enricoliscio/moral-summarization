SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was caught on video and posted on YouTube. The incident occurred when the man approached Etheridge on a Washington street and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge grabbed the man's wrist and neck, demanding to know who he was. The congressman has expressed regret for his actions, saying that no matter how partisan or difficult things get, there is no excuse for his response. However, he has not apologized directly to the young men involved because he doesn't know who they are. The incident has sparked criticism, with one conservative blogger calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress" and accusing him of "physical assault" on a college student.

END OF SUMMARY.
