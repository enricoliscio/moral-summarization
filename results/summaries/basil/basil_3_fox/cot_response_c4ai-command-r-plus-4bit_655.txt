SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for his aggressive behavior in a recent incident where he was caught on camera in a physical confrontation with a young man. The video, posted to YouTube, shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified man after he was asked about his support for the "Obama agenda." The congressman's shameful conduct has been condemned, with critics calling it "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge expressed regret for his actions, stating that he has "profoundly" regretted the incident and that he has no excuse for his response. The physical assault has sparked outrage, especially as Etheridge has joined Obama's policies that are seen as an assault on North Carolina jobs. This incident raises questions about the conduct expected from members of Congress and the moral boundaries they should uphold. 

END OF SUMMARY.
