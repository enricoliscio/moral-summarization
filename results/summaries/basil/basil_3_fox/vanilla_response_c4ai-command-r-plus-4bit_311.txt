SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was captured on video and posted online. In the video, Etheridge is seen grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The congressman has said that he regrets his actions and that his behavior was inappropriate. Etheridge is running for re-election in November and has faced criticism for his support of President Obama's policies. Political observers predict he will likely retain his seat.

Etheridge expressed regret for his actions, stating that he allowed a "partisan" and "difficult" environment to influence his behavior. He also noted that he has faced similar situations in the past but that it was no excuse for his response. The congressman has not apologized directly to the young man involved as he does not know his identity. 

The incident has sparked criticism from conservative bloggers and Etheridge's political opponents, who have characterized the congressman's behavior as "unbecoming" of a member of Congress. 

END OF SUMMARY.
