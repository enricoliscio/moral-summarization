Alright, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down what they need.

First, the user provided a news article about Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation. They want me to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Okay, starting with STEP 1: Identifying morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "confrontation," "sorry," "tussle," "partisan," "excuse," "profoundly," "regrets," "incident," "approaching," "identify," "student," "camera," "snatch," "grab," "refuse," "demand," "right," "apologize," "spit," "push," "threaten," "conduct," "unbecoming," "member," "assault," "beyond the pale," "funding," "blogger," "project," "apologize," "incident," "long day," "conduct," "unbecoming," "member," "assault," "beyond the pale," "funding," "blogger," "project," "apologize," "incident," "long day," "conduct," "unbecoming," "member," "assault," "beyond the pale," "funding," "blogger," "project," "apologize," "incident," "long day."

Now, for the summary. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: the confrontation, Etheridge's apology, the context of the incident, and the political implications.

I should mention the video, the confrontation, his apology, the context of the fundraiser, and the criticism from the blogger. Also, include his political stance and the upcoming election. I'll make sure to use words like "apologized," "profoundly," "incident," "snatching," "grabbing," "unbecoming," "assault," "beyond the pale," and "criticized."

Let me structure it: Start with the event, his apology, the details of the confrontation, his explanation, the criticism, and end with his political situation. I need to keep it flowing naturally while including the moral terms.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Time to put it all together in a coherent summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rep. Bob Etheridge apologized for a confrontation caught on video, where he grabbed a student's wrist and neck after the student questioned his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge admitted his actions were "unbecoming" of a member of Congress and expressed regret, though he hasn't apologized to the student, claiming he doesn't know their identity. The incident occurred after a "long day" and amid criticism for his support of Obama's policies. Conservative blogger Mike Flynn called the conduct "beyond the pale," adding to the political backlash. Etheridge, a veteran congressman, is facing re-election against a Republican candidate.
