SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was captured on an internet video. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda". Etheridge, a Democrat, said he is "profoundly" sorry for his response and acknowledged that it was no excuse for his behavior, regardless of the circumstances. The congressman has not apologized to the young men involved because he does not know who they are. The incident occurred outside a fundraiser headlined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and has sparked criticism from political opponents. Etheridge is running for re-election in November and has been a strong supporter of President Obama's policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
