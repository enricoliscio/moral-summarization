SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has issued a public apology for his recent physical confrontation with a young man, which was caught on an amateur video and posted online. The lawmaker, who has represented the state's 2nd Congressional District since 1997, is seen grabbing the wrist and neck of an unidentified individual who approached him and inquired about his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge admits that his response was unacceptable, saying he "profoundly" regrets the incident and that he has no excuse for his actions, even after a "long day." The congressman, who is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers, is criticized by some for his unbecoming conduct and for joining what they call "Obama's assault on North Carolina jobs." The incident has sparked moral concerns, with Etheridge's actions being labeled as an "assault" on a "college student," and going "beyond the pale." The congressman has also come under fire from conservative bloggers, who have brought attention to his support for controversial legislation, such as Obama's health care overhaul and the cap-and-trade bill.
