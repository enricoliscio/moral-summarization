SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was caught on video and posted to YouTube. The incident occurred on a Washington street when the man approached Etheridge and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge, a Democrat, grabbed the man's wrist and neck, demanding to know who he was. The congressman said he was "profoundly" sorry for his response, adding that it was no excuse for his behavior, even considering the partisan and difficult nature of politics. Etheridge has not apologized to the young men involved because he does not know who they are. The incident has sparked criticism, with some calling his conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge is running for re-election in November against Republican Renee Ellmers.

END OF SUMMARY.
