Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want a news article summarized while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the specific morally framed words to use. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Rep. Bob Etheridge was involved in a physical confrontation, which is a main point. He apologized, but there's some context about the incident happening after a long day and his political stance.

I need to identify the morally charged words: confrontation, tussle, grabbing, response, incident, grabs, spat, pushed, threatened, conduct, assault. I should use these terms in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include the main events: the video showing the confrontation, Etheridge's apology, the context of the incident, and the political implications. I should mention the young man's approach, Etheridge's actions, the apology, and the criticism from Mike Flynn.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the essential details without adding extra information. I'll make sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and flows logically.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key points are covered with the appropriate moral framing.

SUMMARY: Three days after a video emerged showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge in a physical confrontation with a young man, the congressman issued a written statement expressing profound regret for the incident. The video, posted to YouTube, depicts Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of a student who approached him and questioned his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge acknowledged that his response was unacceptable, even in the face of partisanship. He stated he had not apologized to the young men involved because he did not know their identities. The incident occurred after a "long day," but Etheridge emphasized that this was no excuse for his conduct. Conservative blogger Mike Flynn criticized Etheridge, calling his actions "unbecoming of a member of Congress" and likening them to an assault. The video, filmed outside a fundraiser featuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has sparked controversy as Etheridge faces re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers. END OF SUMMARY.
