SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, saying he is "profoundly" sorry for his actions. The incident, caught on amateur video, shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's conduct is deemed "unbecoming" of a member of Congress, and his physical assault on the college student goes "beyond the pale." The congressman claimed he had a "long day" and had been "threatened, pushed, and spat at" before, but acknowledged that was no excuse for his behavior. Etheridge is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers in November. END OF SUMMARY.
