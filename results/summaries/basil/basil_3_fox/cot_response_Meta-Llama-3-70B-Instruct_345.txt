SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, saying he is "profoundly" sorry for his actions. The incident, caught on amateur video, shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's conduct has been deemed "unbecoming" of a member of Congress, and his physical assault on the college student has been widely criticized. Despite his apology, Etheridge has not reached out to the young men involved, citing that he doesn't know who they are. The incident has sparked outrage, with some calling it a "bad" example of behavior from a public official. Etheridge's actions have been seen as part of a larger pattern of "assault" on North Carolina jobs, and his re-election bid is now under scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
