SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for his physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, which was captured on an amateur video and posted on YouTube. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's response was deemed unacceptable, and he has expressed profound regret for the incident. Despite his apology, Etheridge has not reached out to the young men involved, citing that he doesn't know who they are. The congressman's conduct has been labeled as "unbecoming of a member of Congress" and his physical assault on the college student has been widely condemned. The incident has sparked controversy, with some critics accusing Etheridge of being part of Obama's "assault on North Carolina jobs." Etheridge is running for re-election in November and has faced criticism for his votes in favor of President Obama's health care overhaul legislation and the Democratic climate change bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
