SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has issued a public apology for his physical confrontation with a young man, which was captured on video and circulated online. The incident, which has been characterized as a "tussle," involves Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified man who approached him with questions about his support for the "Obama agenda." The congressman's response has been deemed inappropriate and unacceptable, with Etheridge himself acknowledging that his conduct was "unbecoming of a member of Congress." The video has sparked criticism from political opponents, who have also condemned Etheridge's support for President Obama's policies. Etheridge's apology acknowledges the intensity of partisan politics but does not excuse his actions. The incident has raised questions about the boundaries of public interaction with politicians and the potential consequences for Etheridge's re-election campaign. 

END OF SUMMARY.
