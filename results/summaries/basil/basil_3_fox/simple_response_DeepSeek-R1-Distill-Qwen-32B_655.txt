Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a student. The user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, ending with the specified tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The key events are the video showing Etheridge grabbing the student, his apology, the context of the incident, and the political implications. I should include that he apologized but hasn't contacted the student yet. Also, mention the criticism from a conservative blogger and his political stance.

I need to keep the moral aspects clear. The article highlights that as a public official, his behavior was inappropriate. I'll make sure to note that his actions were unbecoming and contrast it with his political support for Obama's agenda.

I should structure the summary to start with the incident, then his apology, the context of the fundraiser, the student's reason, the criticism, and his political background. Keeping it concise but covering all important points.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all necessary elements without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a student in Washington, D.C., captured in a viral video. The incident occurred after the student approached Etheridge and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The video shows Etheridge grabbing the student's wrist and neck, demanding to know his identity. Etheridge later stated he "profoundly" regrets the incident, acknowledging that his response was unacceptable, even after a "long day." He has not apologized to the student, citing not knowing his identity. Critics, including conservative blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's actions as unbecoming of a member of Congress, especially given his support for Obama's policies. Etheridge, a Democrat running for re-election, has backed Obama's health care overhaul and climate change legislation. The incident has drawn attention to his behavior as a public official.  
END OF SUMMARY.
