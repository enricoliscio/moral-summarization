Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a young man. The incident happened three days ago, and now Etheridge has apologized. The video shows him grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." 

I should note the key points: the incident, the apology, the context of the video, and the political implications. Also, the fact that Etheridge hasn't apologized directly because he doesn't know the man's identity. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the confrontation, mention the apology, explain the context of the video, and then touch on the political angle, including his upcoming election and the criticism from a conservative blogger.

I should make sure to include that Etheridge is a Democrat, the details of the confrontation, his reasons for not apologizing directly, and the political observers' predictions about his re-election chances. Also, mention his support for Obama's policies.

Putting it all together concisely without missing any important details. Make sure it's clear and flows well.

Etheridge acknowledged that his response was unacceptable, though he has not apologized directly to the man, stating he doesn't know his identity.
