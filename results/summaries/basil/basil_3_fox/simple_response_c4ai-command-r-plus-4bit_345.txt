SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has found himself in hot water after a video surfaced showing him in a physical confrontation with a young man. The incident, which has sparked moral outrage, raises questions about the conduct expected of a member of Congress. In the video, Etheridge is seen grabbing the student's wrist and neck, refusing to let go, and demanding to know the young man's identity. The congressman has since apologized, acknowledging that his response was inappropriate and that he has "a right to know who" is recording him. The incident has also sparked political backlash, with critics pointing to Etheridge's support for the Obama administration's policies and suggesting that the congressman has assaulted North Carolina jobs. Despite the controversy, political observers predict Etheridge is likely to hold on to his seat in the upcoming election. However, the moral implications of his actions and the potential impact on public trust in Congress remain to be seen. END OF SUMMARY.
