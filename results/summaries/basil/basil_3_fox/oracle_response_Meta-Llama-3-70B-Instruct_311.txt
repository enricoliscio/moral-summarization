SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was caught on video and posted on YouTube. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified man after he asked if the congressman supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's response was widely criticized, with many calling it an assault. The congressman has since said he is "profoundly" sorry for the incident, acknowledging that his conduct was unbecoming of a member of Congress. Etheridge claimed he had a long day and had been spat at, pushed, and threatened before, but admitted that was no excuse for his behavior. The incident has sparked outrage, with some calling it a physical assault on a college student. Etheridge is running for re-election in November and his opponents are likely to use this incident against him.

END OF SUMMARY.
