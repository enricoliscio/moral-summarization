SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, which was captured on an amateur video and posted on YouTube. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's response was widely condemned, with critics calling his conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress." The congressman has expressed regret for the incident, saying "no matter how partisan and no matter how difficult things get sometimes, that's no excuse for my response." He added that he has been "spat at, pushed and threatened before," but that's no excuse for his behavior. The incident has sparked outrage, with some calling it a "physical assault" on a college student. Etheridge is running for re-election in November, and political observers predict he will likely hold on to his seat.

END OF SUMMARY.
