Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bob Etheridge and the incident where he had a physical confrontation with a young man. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It happened three days after a video surfaced. Etheridge apologized, saying he's profoundly sorry. The incident involved a young man asking him about supporting the Obama agenda. Etheridge grabbed the man's wrist and neck, tried to take his phone. He said he didn't know who they were, so he hasn't apologized directly. The video was posted on YouTube by someone called DCCameraGuy. The author mentions that Etheridge is facing re-election and his actions are seen as unbecoming for a congressman, especially with his political stance on Obama's policies. There's a conservative blogger criticizing him.

I need to make sure the summary includes the apology, the context of the confrontation, the reason for not apologizing directly, and the political implications. Also, highlight the moral judgment, like the blogger's statement about it being beyond the pale.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it: mention the apology, the incident details, the reason for not apologizing, the political context, and the criticism. Make sure it flows well and covers all key points without being too wordy.

I think I have all the elements. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Three days after a video emerged showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge physically confronting a young man in Washington, the Democratic congressman issued a written apology, expressing "profound" regret for the incident. The video, posted on YouTube, shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man approached him and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge claimed he didn't know the man's identity and thus hadn't apologized directly, though he acknowledged that his actions were unacceptable, even after a "long day." Conservative critics, including blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's behavior as unbecoming of a member of Congress, particularly given his support for Obama's policies. Etheridge, who has represented North Carolina since 1997, is running for re-election in November. The incident has drawn attention to his political stance and conduct.  
END OF SUMMARY.
