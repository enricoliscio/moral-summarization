SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, which was captured on an internet video. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda". Etheridge's conduct was unbecoming of a member of Congress, as he tried to snatch a cell phone camera and demanded to know who the man was. The congressman's response to the situation was unacceptable, and he has since expressed profound regret for the incident. Etheridge claimed he had a long day and had been spat at, pushed, and threatened before, but that's no excuse for his physical assault on the college student. The incident has sparked outrage, with critics calling his conduct an assault on a student. Etheridge is running for re-election in November, but this incident may impact his chances.

END OF SUMMARY.
