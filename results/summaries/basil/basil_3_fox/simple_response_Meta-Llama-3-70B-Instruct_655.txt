SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was caught on video and posted on YouTube. The incident occurred when the man approached Etheridge and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge grabbed the man's wrist and neck, demanding to know who he was. The congressman has expressed regret for his actions, saying that even in a difficult political climate, there is no excuse for physical confrontation. However, he has not apologized to the young men involved because he claims not to know who they are. The incident has sparked outrage, with conservative bloggers calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress" and accusing him of "physical assault" on a college student. The incident may have implications for Etheridge's re-election campaign.
