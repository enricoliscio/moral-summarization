SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was caught on video and posted to YouTube. The incident occurred when the man approached Etheridge on a Washington street and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge, a Democrat, grabbed the man's wrist and neck, and demanded to know who he was. The congressman has expressed regret for his actions, stating that no matter how partisan or difficult things get, it's no excuse for his response. However, he has not apologized to the young men involved because he doesn't know who they are. The incident has sparked criticism, with a conservative blogger calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress." The incident has also raised questions about Etheridge's fitness for office, particularly in light of his support for President Obama's health care overhaul and climate change legislation.

END OF SUMMARY.
