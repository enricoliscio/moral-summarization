SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, saying he is "profoundly" sorry for his actions. In a video posted on YouTube, Etheridge is seen grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The congressman's response was deemed "unbecoming" of a member of Congress, and his conduct has been criticized as "bad" and "beyond the pale." Etheridge has refused to apologize to the young men involved, citing that he doesn't know who they are. The incident has sparked controversy, with some calling it a "physical assault" on a college student. Etheridge is running for re-election in November and has been a strong supporter of President Obama's policies. END OF SUMMARY.
