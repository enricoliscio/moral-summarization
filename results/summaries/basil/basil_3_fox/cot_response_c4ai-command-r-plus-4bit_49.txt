SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has found himself in hot water after a video surfaced showing him in a physical confrontation with a young man. The incident, which occurred on a Washington street, has sparked moral outrage and prompted the congressman to issue an apology. In the video, Etheridge is seen grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man who had questioned him about his support for the "Obama agenda." The congressman's response has been deemed "unbecoming" and an "assault." Despite his apology, in which he acknowledged that his actions were inexcusable, Etheridge's behavior has raised concerns about his conduct as a member of Congress. The incident has also brought attention to Etheridge's political affiliations, including his support for President Obama's controversial health care overhaul and the Democratic climate change bill. This moral lapse in judgment has cast a shadow over Etheridge's re-election campaign, where he is running against Republican Renee Ellmers. While political observers predict Etheridge will hold onto his seat, this incident serves as a reminder that elected officials must uphold a certain moral standard, even in the face of partisan challenges.
