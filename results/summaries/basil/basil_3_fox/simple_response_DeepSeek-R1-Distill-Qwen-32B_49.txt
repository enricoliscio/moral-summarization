Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a young man. The incident was caught on video and has sparked some controversy. The author seems to be critical of Etheridge's actions, pointing out that it's unbecoming for a member of Congress. They also mention his political stance, which adds context to the situation.

First, I should identify the key points: the confrontation, the video, Etheridge's apology, his explanation, the political context, and the reaction from a conservative blogger. I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements without going over 200 words.

I also need to maintain the moral framing. The author is implying that Etheridge's behavior was inappropriate and that it reflects poorly on him as a public official. So, the summary should highlight that his actions were unbecoming and contrast it with his political support for Obama's policies.

I should structure the summary to first describe the incident, then Etheridge's apology and explanation, followed by the political context and the blogger's criticism. I need to keep the language clear and concise, making sure the moral judgment is evident.

Let me draft it out:

Etheridge had a confrontation with a student who questioned his support for Obama's agenda. The video shows him grabbing the student's wrist and neck. He apologized but hasn't reached out to the student, citing not knowing their identity. He mentioned it was a long day but acknowledged no excuse. The blogger criticizes him for both the incident and his political stance. The summary should reflect the author's disapproval of his actions and the political context.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to make sure it's necessary and contributes to the overall summary without unnecessary details.
