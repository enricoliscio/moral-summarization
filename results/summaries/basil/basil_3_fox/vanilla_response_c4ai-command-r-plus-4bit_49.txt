SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was captured on video and posted online. In the video, Etheridge is seen grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The congressman has said that he regrets his actions and that his behavior was "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Political observers predict that Etheridge, who is running for re-election in November, will likely hold on to his seat despite the incident. Etheridge has represented North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District since 1997 and has voted in favor of President Obama's health care overhaul and the Democratic climate change bill.
END OF SUMMARY.
