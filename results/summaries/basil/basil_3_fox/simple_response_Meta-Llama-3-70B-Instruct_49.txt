SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, which was captured on an internet video. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda". Etheridge expressed regret for his actions, stating that even in a difficult political climate, there is no excuse for physical aggression. He has not apologized to the young men involved as he does not know their identities. The incident has sparked criticism, with a conservative blogger calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress". The congressman's actions are seen as particularly egregious given his support for President Obama's policies, which have been criticized for harming North Carolina jobs. The incident has raised questions about Etheridge's fitness for office as he runs for re-election.
