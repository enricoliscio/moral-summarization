SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, issued a public apology for his physical confrontation with a young man, which was captured on video and sparked moral outrage. The incident, which has been labeled as a "tussle" and an "assault," shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man asked about his support for the "Obama agenda." The congressman acknowledged that his response was inappropriate and apologized, citing a "long day" as a mitigating factor. The video, posted online, has raised questions about Etheridge's conduct, with political opponents criticizing his support for the Obama administration's policies and his physical assault on a student. The congressman has also faced backlash from conservative bloggers, but observers predict he will likely retain his seat in the upcoming election. The incident highlights the challenges of maintaining moral standards in the face of partisan tensions and the potential consequences for elected officials who cross moral boundaries.
