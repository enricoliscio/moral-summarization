SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has issued a public apology for his physical altercation with a young man, which was captured on video and circulated online. In the video, Etheridge is seen grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified man who approached him and asked about his support for the "Obama agenda." The congressman's actions have been criticized as inappropriate and unbecoming of a member of Congress. Etheridge acknowledged that his behavior was unacceptable and apologized, citing a "long day" as a mitigating factor but not an excuse. The incident has sparked political debate, with conservative blogger Mike Flynn characterizing it as an assault and criticizing Etheridge's support for Obama's policies. Despite the controversy, political observers predict Etheridge is likely to retain his seat in the upcoming election against Republican challenger Renee Ellmers. The congressman's voting record includes support for Obama's health care overhaul and the cap-and-trade climate change bill. Etheridge's apology and acknowledgment of his actions as inappropriate are positive steps toward resolving the issue. However, the incident underscores the importance of maintaining civility and respect in political discourse, regardless of partisan differences or the challenges of public life.
END OF SUMMARY.
