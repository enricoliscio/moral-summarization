SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, saying he is "profoundly" sorry for the incident. The video, posted on YouTube, shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's behavior is deemed "unbecoming" of a member of Congress, and his physical assault on a college student goes "beyond the pale." The congressman has not apologized to the young men involved, citing that he doesn't know who they are. Despite the incident, Etheridge is expected to hold on to his seat in the November election. His conduct has been criticized by conservative bloggers, who have labeled it an "assault" on a college student. END OF SUMMARY.
