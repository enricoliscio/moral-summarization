Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a young man. The incident was caught on video and has sparked some controversy. The main points are:

1. Etheridge grabbed the man's wrist and neck after being asked about supporting the "Obama agenda."
2. He later apologized, saying he regrets the incident and that partisanship isn't an excuse.
3. The video shows the congressman trying to take the man's phone and refusing to let go.
4. The man asked to be released, and Etheridge responded by grabbing his neck.
5. Etheridge hasn't apologized to the young men because he doesn't know their identities.
6. He mentioned being spat at and threatened before but still said it's no excuse.
7. The incident happened after a long day.
8. A conservative blogger criticized Etheridge's actions, calling them unbecoming of a Congressman.
9. Etheridge is up for re-election and has supported Obama's policies like healthcare and cap-and-trade.
10. The article also mentions the political context, his district, and his committees.

Now, the user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. So, I need to highlight the moral implications, like how Etheridge's actions reflect poorly on him as a public official. I should include his apology, the specifics of the confrontation, the criticism from the blogger, and the political context.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the tokens. Let me structure it:

Start with the confrontation, mention the video, his apology, the details of the incident, his reasons, the criticism, and the political angle.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral framing presented in the article.

Let me draft it:

"North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man in Washington, captured on video. The incident occurred after the man asked Etheridge about his support for the 'Obama agenda.' The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck, refusing to let go. Etheridge later apologized, stating he 'profoundly' regrets the incident and that partisanship isn't an excuse. He mentioned it happened after a 'long day' and hasn't apologized to the men involved because he doesn't know their identities. Conservative blogger Mike Flynn criticized Etheridge's actions as 'unbecoming of a member of Congress,' highlighting the political context. Etheridge, who supports Obama's policies, is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers."

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me trim it down to fit under 200 words and make sure it's clear.

I think that's a good summary. It includes the key moral points: his apology, the confrontation details, the criticism, and the political implications.
