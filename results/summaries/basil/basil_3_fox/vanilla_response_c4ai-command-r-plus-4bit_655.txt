SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was captured on video and posted online. In the video, Etheridge is seen grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The congressman has said that he regrets his response and that he was wrong to react the way he did. He also stated that he has not apologized directly to the young man because he does not know his identity. The incident has sparked criticism from political opponents, with some calling for Etheridge's resignation. The video has also raised questions about the role of citizens in holding their elected officials accountable and the boundaries of acceptable behavior for both citizens and public figures. The incident is likely to impact Etheridge's re-election campaign in November.
END OF SUMMARY.
