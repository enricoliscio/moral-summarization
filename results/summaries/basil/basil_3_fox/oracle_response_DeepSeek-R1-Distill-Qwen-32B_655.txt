Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a student. The user provided a list of morally charged words that need to be included, so I'll make sure to use those.

I should start by identifying the main events: the video showing the confrontation, Etheridge's apology, the context of the incident, and the political implications. I'll need to mention the specific actions like grabbing, tussle, and assault to maintain the moral tone.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include all these elements concisely. I should mention that Etheridge apologized but hasn't directly apologized to the student because he doesn't know his identity. Also, the political context, like his support for Obama's policies and his re-election bid, is important to include as it adds to the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be brief but comprehensive. I'll make sure to use the specified moral words to highlight the inappropriate conduct of a public official. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY:  
Three days after a video emerged showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge in a physical confrontation with a young man, the congressman issued a written statement expressing profound regret for the incident. The video, posted on YouTube, depicts Etheridge grabbing the student's wrist and neck after the student questioned his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge acknowledged that his response was unacceptable, even in the heat of partisanship, but stated he had not apologized to the young men involved because he did not know their identities. The lawmaker claimed the incident occurred after a "long day" and admitted to being spat at, pushed, and threatened before. Conservative critics, including blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's conduct as unbecoming of a member of Congress, particularly given his support for Obama's policies. The confrontation took place outside a fundraiser for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Etheridge, who has represented North Carolina since 1997, is running for re-election in November. His physical assault on the student has drawn widespread criticism, with some questioning his behavior as a public official. END OF SUMMARY.
