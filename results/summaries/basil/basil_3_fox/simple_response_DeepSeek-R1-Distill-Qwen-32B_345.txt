Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are that Rep. Bob Etheridge had a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street. The incident was caught on video. The young man asked Etheridge about supporting the "Obama agenda," and Etheridge grabbed him. Etheridge apologized, saying it was no excuse for his response. He mentioned it was after a long day and that he hasn't apologized to the young man because he doesn't know who he is. The article also mentions political context, like Etheridge supporting Obama's policies and facing a re-election.

I need to highlight the moral aspects: the inappropriate behavior for a congressman, the context of the political climate, and the consequences for his reputation. Also, include the apology and the broader implications of the incident.

I should structure the summary to start with the event, then the apology, the context, and the reaction. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include that the young man was a student and that the video was posted online. Also, mention the political blogger's criticism.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral point is clear and the summary flows logically.
