Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

So, the article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge being involved in a physical confrontation caught on video. Three days after the video surfaced, he apologized. The video shows him grabbing a young man's wrist and neck after the man asked him about supporting the "Obama agenda." Etheridge says he's profoundly sorry and that partisanship doesn't excuse his actions. He mentioned it was a long day but hasn't apologized to the young men because he doesn't know their identities. The confrontation happened outside a fundraiser with Nancy Pelosi. A conservative blogger criticized his actions. Etheridge is running for re-election against a Republican, and political observers think he'll keep his seat. He supports Obama's healthcare and climate change bills.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words. I'll focus on the main events: the incident, his apology, the context of the confrontation, the political implications, and his stance on key legislation.

I should structure it to include who, what, when, where, why, and the consequences. Make sure to mention the video, his apology, the man's question, his refusal to apologize directly, the fundraiser context, the criticism, his re-election bid, and his policy support.

Let me piece this together concisely, ensuring it's all within the word limit and flows logically.
