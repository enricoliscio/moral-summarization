SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has issued a public apology for his physical assault on a young man, which was captured on video and circulated online. The incident, which occurred after a "long day," as Etheridge described it, involved the congressman grabbing the wrist and neck of an unidentified man who had approached him and asked if he supported "the Obama agenda." Etheridge's response has been criticized as "unbecoming of a member of Congress," and he has expressed regret for his actions, acknowledging that his behavior was unacceptable despite the challenges of partisan politics. The incident has sparked moral outrage, with political observers questioning Etheridge's conduct and character. The congressman has also been criticized for his support of President Obama's policies, which are unpopular in his state. This incident raises ethical concerns about the behavior expected of those in positions of power and influence, and the moral responsibility to maintain a certain standard of conduct, even in challenging circumstances. END OF SUMMARY.
