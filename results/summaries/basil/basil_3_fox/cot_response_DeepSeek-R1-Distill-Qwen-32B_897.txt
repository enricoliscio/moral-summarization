Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the user's query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes those words.

Looking at the news article, it's about Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a student. The user provided an example response, so I can use that as a guide. In STEP 1, I need to extract all single words that carry moral implications. Words like "apologized," "profoundly," "sorry," "tussle," "partisan," "difficult," "excuse," "snatching," "grabbing," "spat," "pushed," "threatened," "conduct," "unbecoming," "assault," "beyond the pale," "foul," "shameful," "outrage," "condemnation," "condemned," "condemn," "scandal," "disgrace," "outrageous," "reprehensible," "abhorrent," "abhor," "abhorrently," "condemnatory," "condemnation," "condemn," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns," "condemning," "condemned," "condemns,"
