SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, which was captured on an internet video. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda". Etheridge claims he is "profoundly" sorry for his response, stating that it was no excuse for his behavior, even in a difficult and partisan environment. The congressman has not apologized to the young men involved as he doesn't know who they are. The incident has sparked outrage, with a conservative blogger calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress". The moral framing of this incident highlights the importance of maintaining decorum and respect, even in the face of disagreement or provocation. As a public figure, Etheridge's behavior falls short of the standards expected of him.

END OF SUMMARY.
