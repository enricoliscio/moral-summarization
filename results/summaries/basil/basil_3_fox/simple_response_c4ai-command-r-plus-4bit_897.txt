SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was captured on video and posted online. The incident, which has sparked criticism and ethical concerns, occurred when the man approached Etheridge and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge was seen grabbing the man's wrist and neck and demanding to know his identity. The congressman has since expressed regret for his actions, stating that he has "no excuse" for his response. The incident has also raised questions about the appropriateness of such aggressive behavior by a member of Congress. A conservative blogger, Mike Flynn, has identified the event as occurring outside a fundraiser headlined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Despite the incident, political observers predict Etheridge is likely to hold on to his seat in the upcoming election. However, his support for controversial policies, such as Obama's health care overhaul and the Democratic climate change bill, has drawn criticism from opponents. This incident highlights the importance of maintaining a moral and ethical standard, even in the face of difficult and partisan circumstances.
END OF SUMMARY.
