SUMMARY:
North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man on a Washington street, saying he is "profoundly" sorry for his actions. The incident, caught on amateur video, shows Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of the unidentified young man after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's conduct has been deemed "unbecoming" of a member of Congress, and his physical "assault" on a college student has been widely criticized. Despite his apology, Etheridge has not reached out to the young men involved, saying he doesn't know who they are. The incident has sparked outrage, with some calling it "bad" and "beyond the pale." Etheridge, who is running for re-election, has been a strong supporter of President Obama's policies, including the health care overhaul and climate change legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
