SUMMARY:

North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man that was caught on video and posted on YouTube. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after being asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge, a Democrat, said he is "profoundly" sorry for his response and acknowledged that it was no excuse for his behavior, even considering the partisan and difficult circumstances. He has not apologized to the young men involved as he does not know who they are. The incident occurred outside a fundraiser headlined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Etheridge is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers in November and has been predicted to hold on to his seat. He has voted in favor of President Obama's health care overhaul legislation and the Democratic climate change bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
