SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has issued a public apology for his physical confrontation with a young man, which was captured on video and circulated online. The incident, which has been characterized as a "tussle," involves Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of an unidentified man who approached him and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The congressman's response has been criticized as unbecoming of a member of Congress, with some interpreting his actions as an assault. Etheridge expressed regret for the incident, stating that he has "profoundly" apologized and that his conduct was unacceptable, regardless of the partisan climate and the stress of the day. The incident has sparked political debate, with conservative bloggers weighing in, and could impact Etheridge's re-election campaign against Republican Renee Ellmers in November. The congressman's support for controversial legislation, such as Obama's health care overhaul and the cap-and-trade bill, is also noted.
