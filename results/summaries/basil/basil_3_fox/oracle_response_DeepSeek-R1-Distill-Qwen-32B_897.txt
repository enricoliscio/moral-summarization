Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a young man after the man asked him about supporting the "Obama agenda." There's a video showing Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck. Etheridge later apologized, saying he regrets the incident but hasn't apologized to the young men because he doesn't know their identities. The article also mentions political context, like Etheridge's support for Obama's policies and his upcoming re-election.

The morally framed words to include are: confrontation, tussle, grabbing, response, incident, grabs, spat, pushed, threatened, conduct, assault.

I need to make sure these words are present in the summary. Let me structure the summary step by step.

First, introduce the incident: Etheridge was involved in a confrontation, which was a tussle. Then, describe the actions: grabbing the wrist and neck, the man's questions, Etheridge's response. Mention the video, the apology, and his reasons for not apologizing directly. Include the political implications and the criticism about his conduct being unbecoming.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including all the key moral terms. Let me draft it now, ensuring each of those words is included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat, has apologized for a physical confrontation with a young man in Washington, D.C., captured in a viral video. The incident involved Etheridge grabbing the man's wrist and neck after the man questioned his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge described the encounter as a "tussle" and expressed profound regret, stating that partisanship was no excuse for his response. The video shows Etheridge attempting to snatch the man's phone, demanding his identity, and refusing to let go despite the man's pleas. Etheridge admitted he had been spat at, pushed, and threatened before but emphasized that this was no excuse. He has not apologized to the young men involved, as he does not know their identities. Critics, including conservative blogger Mike Flynn, condemned Etheridge's conduct as unbecoming of a member of Congress, linking it to his political stance on issues like Obama's policies. Etheridge, who supports Obama's health care overhaul and climate change legislation, is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers. END OF SUMMARY.
