Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a young man. The incident happened three days before the summary, and a video of it was posted on YouTube. Etheridge grabbed the man's wrist and neck after the man asked him about supporting the "Obama agenda." 

Etheridge apologized, saying he regrets the incident, even though he didn't know the man's identity. He mentioned it was after a long day but that doesn't excuse his actions. The video shows the man trying to record him, and Etheridge trying to take the phone. 

There's also some political context: Etheridge supports Obama's policies, and a conservative blogger criticized him for the incident, linking it to his political stance. He's running for re-election against a Republican, and political observers think he'll win. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the incident, the apology, the video details, political implications, and his re-election chances.

Let me structure it: start with the incident, then the apology, mention the video and confrontation, political criticism, and his re-election status. Keep it concise, making sure not to exceed the word limit.

I should also ensure clarity and flow, using proper grammar and punctuation. Let me draft it step by step, checking each part to make sure it's covered without being too wordy.
