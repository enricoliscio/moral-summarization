Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge getting into a physical confrontation with a young man. It happened three days ago, and now Etheridge is apologizing. The incident was caught on video, which was posted on YouTube. The young man approached Etheridge and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge grabbed his wrist and neck. In his statement, Etheridge says he's "profoundly" sorry and that no excuse justifies his actions, even though he's been spat at and threatened before. He hasn't apologized yet because he doesn't know who the young men are.

There's also some context about the incident happening after a long day. A conservative blogger, Mike Flynn, criticized Etheridge's conduct, saying it's unbecoming for a Congressman and that it's beyond the pale. The confrontation happened near a fundraiser with Nancy Pelosi. The video's uploader is "DCCameraGuy," and the identities of the men aren't revealed.

Etheridge is running for re-election against Renee Ellmers, a Republican nurse. Observers think he'll keep his seat. He's been in Congress since 1997 and supports Obama's health care and climate change bills.

So, to summarize, I need to include the main points: who, what, when, where, why, and the consequences. I should mention the apology, the incident details, the political context, and the implications for his re-election.

I should structure it concisely, making sure not to exceed 200 words. I'll start with the apology, describe the confrontation, the context of the fundraiser, the criticism, and his political stance. Also, note that he hasn't apologized yet because he doesn't know the young men's identities.

I need to ensure clarity and keep it under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft.

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me look at that to see the structure. The example starts with the apology, describes the incident, mentions the fundraiser, criticism, and his political stance. It ends with his re-election chances. I can follow a similar structure.

I should make sure to include all key elements without going into too much detail. Also, ensure that the summary flows well and covers all necessary points succinctly.
