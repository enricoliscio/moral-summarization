Alright, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a news article about Rep. Bob Etheridge's confrontation with a student. The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. These words are: confrontation, tussle, grabbing, response, incident, grabs, spat, pushed, threatened, conduct, assault.

I should start by reading the article carefully to identify the key points. The main events are the video showing Etheridge grabbing a student, his apology, and the political context. I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to include the confrontation, Etheridge's actions (grabbing, tussle), his response, the incident details, and the moral judgment on his conduct. Also, mentioning the political implications, like his support for Obama's agenda and the upcoming election, is important for context.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all necessary elements. I'll start by mentioning the three-day delay after the video surfaced, Etheridge's apology, the specifics of the incident, and the reactions, including the conservative blogger's criticism. Finally, I'll add the political context about his re-election and stance on policies.

I should check that I'm using the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, "tussle" and "grabbing" describe the physical actions, while "conduct" and "assault" highlight the moral judgment. I need to avoid adding any words that weren't in the original article and stick to the facts while emphasizing the moral aspects.

I'll also make sure the summary is concise, hitting all the key points without unnecessary details. It's important to maintain the author's framing, so I'll focus on the negative aspects of Etheridge's actions, like the conservative blogger's harsh words, to show the moral disapproval.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's under 200 words and that all the morally framed words are included where they fit naturally. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: Three days after a video emerged showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge in a confrontation with a young man, the congressman issued a written statement expressing profound regret for the incident. The video, posted to YouTube, depicts Etheridge grabbing the wrist and neck of a student who approached him and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge, who has served in Congress since 1997, claimed he did not know the identity of the individuals involved and had not apologized to them. He acknowledged that his response was unacceptable, even after a "long day," and admitted to being spat at, pushed, and threatened before. Conservative blogger Mike Flynn criticized Etheridge's conduct, calling it unbecoming of a member of Congress and likening it to an assault. The incident occurred outside a fundraiser for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the video's uploader remains anonymous. Etheridge, a Democrat, is running for re-election in November and has supported key Obama administration policies, including the health care overhaul and climate change legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
