Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about an ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities. The ad uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat and criticizes Obama's foreign policy. The group behind it is Republican-linked, and Israel didn't approve it. I should keep the moral framing, highlighting the ad's intent to create anxiety and support for a stronger US stance. Make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement in Florida’s Jewish communities aims to heighten concerns about American policy in the Middle East, using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of Iran’s nuclear threat. The ad features Netanyahu expressing urgency about Iran’s nuclear progress, with dramatic music underscoring the message, before an announcer declares, “The world needs American strength, not apologies,” indirectly criticizing President Obama’s foreign policy as apologetic. Produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former Carter aide, the ad has booked $500,000 in airtime in key Florida areas. An Israeli official stated the government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. The ad reflects a broader trend of using Middle East policy to stir political debate, emphasizing the need for a strong U.S. stance against perceived threats. END OF SUMMARY.
