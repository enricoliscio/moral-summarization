SUMMARY: An advertisement set to run in Florida areas with large Jewish populations attempts to stoke fears about a nuclear Iran and criticizes President Obama's foreign policy. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and includes a swipe at Obama with the line, "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, is run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in several Florida markets. A senior Israeli official stated that the ad was not approved by the Israeli government.
END OF SUMMARY.
