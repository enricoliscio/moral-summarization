SUMMARY: A new political advertisement set to air in Florida stokes fears about a nuclear Iran, featuring a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran. The ad, produced by a group called Secure America Now, also criticizes President Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. The ad will run in areas with large Jewish populations and cost $500,000. The Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it, according to an official. The ad is part of a broader trend of Israel and Middle East policy becoming a contentious issue in presidential politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
