SUMMARY: An ominous new advertisement set to air in Jewish areas of Florida uses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's warnings about Iran's nuclear program to attack President Obama's foreign policy. The ad, produced by a group run by Republican strategists, features dramatic music and an announcer who claims that the world needs "American strength, not apologies." This swipe at Obama echoes Mitt Romney and other Republicans' criticisms of his foreign policy as being too apologetic towards volatile countries. The ad raises moral concerns by attempting to stoke anxiety and exploit fears for political gain, highlighting a sensitive issue in a community already vulnerable to tensions in the Middle East. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating they were not consulted and do not approve of its message. This incident underscores the ethical challenges and moral framing present in political campaigns, particularly when national security and international relations are involved. 

END OF SUMMARY.
