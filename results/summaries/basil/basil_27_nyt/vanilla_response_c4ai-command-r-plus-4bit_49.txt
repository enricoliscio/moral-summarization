SUMMARY: An advertisement by the group Secure America Now attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East, using a news clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran. The ad, which will run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, features dramatic music and an announcer who criticizes President Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. The ad buy is worth $500,000 and will air in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. A senior Israeli official said the government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it.
END OF SUMMARY.
