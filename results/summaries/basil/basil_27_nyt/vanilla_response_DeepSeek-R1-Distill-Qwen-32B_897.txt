Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about a political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities, using Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is produced by a Republican group, Secure America Now, and it's critical of Obama's foreign policy. The ad's message is that the world needs American strength, not apologies, which is a dig at Obama. The group has spent $500,000 on airtime in Florida. Also, the Israeli government wasn't consulted on the ad.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include the key elements: the ad's content, the group behind it, the criticism of Obama, the funding, and the Israeli government's stance. I should structure it so it flows logically, starting with the ad's purpose, then who made it, their message, the funding, and finally the Israeli government's response.

Let me check if I have all the important details. The ad uses Netanyahu's clip, the group is Republican-affiliated, the ad is part of Florida's Jewish areas, the $500k spend, and Israel didn't approve it. I think that's all covered. I need to make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it and then count the words to ensure it's under 200.
