Okay, so I need to summarize this article about a political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about an ad by Secure America Now, which uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is running in Florida areas with large Jewish populations. The soundtrack is intense, like from "Homeland." The narrator ends with a line criticizing Obama's foreign policy as apologetic, which is a subtle attack on him. The group behind the ad includes Republican strategists and a former Carter aide now at Fox. They've spent $500k on ad space. Israel's government wasn't consulted or approved the ad.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the ad's purpose, the use of Netanyahu's clip, the criticism of Obama, the group's background, and the funding. Also, note Israel's lack of involvement.

Let me structure it: Start with the ad's purpose, who made it, where it's running, Netanyahu's quote, the swipe at Obama, the group's info, funding, and Israel's stance.

Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.

Israel's government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
