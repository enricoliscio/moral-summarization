Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about a political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities. The article mentions the ad uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat and criticizes Obama's foreign policy. 

First, I need to identify the key points. The ad is by Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists, costing $500k in Florida areas. Netanyahu's quote is used to create anxiety, and the ad subtly criticizes Obama. Also, the Israeli government wasn't involved.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the ad's purpose, who made it, the funding, and the criticism of Obama. Then note the Israeli government's lack of involvement.

I need to keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown or extra formatting. Just a straightforward summary that captures all the essential elements without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: introduce the ad, who's behind it, the message, the criticism, and the Israeli government's stance. That should cover all the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to raise concerns about American policies in the Middle East. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the nuclear threat posed by Iran, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. The message is framed to criticize President Obama's foreign policy, with a narrator stating, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a subtle jab at the administration. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists Nelson Warfield, John McLaughlin, and Pat Caddell, has reserved $500,000 in airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. However, a senior Israeli official confirmed that the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
