SUMMARY:
In Florida, a new advertisement targeting Jewish populations seeks to raise anxiety about American policies toward Iran, using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear-armed Iran. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, includes a swipe at President Obama, accusing him of apologizing for America's strength. Mitt Romney and other Republicans have criticized Obama's foreign policy as apologetic toward volatile countries like Iran. The ad raises moral concerns about the risks of a nuclear Iran and the appropriateness of apologizing for American strength. It is designed to influence Jewish voters in Florida by stoking fears and highlighting the perceived need for American strength and leadership in the Middle East. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating they were not consulted and do not approve of its content. The ad buy is significant, costing $500,000, and aims to air in several Florida markets. END OF SUMMARY.
