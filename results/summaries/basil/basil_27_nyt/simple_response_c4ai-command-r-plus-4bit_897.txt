SUMMARY: A new political advertisement by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, attempts to stoke anxiety among Jewish voters in Florida over the threat of a nuclear Iran. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and criticizing the world for not taking stronger action. It concludes with a swipe at President Obama, suggesting that his foreign policy is apologetic and weak. The ad is set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, and it raises questions about the role of Israel and Middle East policy in US presidential politics, often in controversial and combustible ways. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating that it was not consulted and does not approve its content. The use of Netanyahu's clip and the implication of Israeli support for the ad's message showcase a moral appeal to voters' fears and a manipulation of international relations for domestic political gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
