SUMMARY: In an attempt to stoke anxiety among Jewish populations in Florida, a new advertisement featuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warns of the impending threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, uses dramatic effect to criticize President Obama's foreign policy, suggesting that he is apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. With a reserved airtime worth $500,000, the ad will run in areas with large Jewish populations and attempts to sway voters by playing on their fears. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating that it was not consulted and does not approve of its content. The moral framing of the article centers around the attempt to manipulate emotions and the potential consequences of such actions, highlighting the closeness of the threat and the perceived lack of action from those in power.
