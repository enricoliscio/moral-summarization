SUMMARY:
A new political advertisement aims to ignite anxiety over the Obama administration's Iran policy, swiping at the President for his seemingly apologetic stance towards volatile countries. The ad, which will air in Florida areas with large Jewish populations, features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear program. It concludes with the line, "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, has reserved $500,000 of airtime in several Florida cities. The ad leverages the morally charged words and the fear of an Iranian nuclear threat to criticize the President's foreign policy approach. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating they were not consulted and do not approve of its content. END OF SUMMARY.
