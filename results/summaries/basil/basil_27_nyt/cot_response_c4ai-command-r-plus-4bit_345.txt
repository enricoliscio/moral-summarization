SUMMARY: An incendiary advertisement campaign targeting Florida's Jewish populations attempts to ignite anxiety over a nuclear Iran, taking a swipe at President Obama with the claim that his foreign policy is apologetic. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's proximity to obtaining nuclear weapons, suggesting that the world needs American strength, not apologies. This ad campaign, created by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, aims to influence voters in a key swing state by portraying Iran as a volatile threat. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating they were not consulted and do not approve of its message. END OF SUMMARY.
