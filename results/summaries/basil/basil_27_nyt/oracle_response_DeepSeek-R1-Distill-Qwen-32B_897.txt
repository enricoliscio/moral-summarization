Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The words to keep are "attempts," "stoke," "closer," "tells," and "apologies." 

First, the article is about an ad targeting Jewish areas in Florida. The ad uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat to create anxiety. I should mention that the ad "attempts" to stoke anxiety, using Netanyahu's quote about Iran getting "closer" to nuclear arms. 

The ad's message is that the world tells Israel to wait, but Netanyahu says not to wait. The unseen announcer says the world needs American strength, not apologies, which is a swipe at Obama's foreign policy. I should note that the group behind the ad is Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists, and they've spent $500,000. Also, the Israeli government wasn't consulted.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the moral framing words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY: A new advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East by using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad highlights Netanyahu's statement that Iran is "closer" to obtaining nuclear arms, while an announcer claims the world needs "American strength, not apologies," subtly criticizing President Obama's foreign policy. Produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists, the ad has reserved $500,000 in airtime. However, the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. The advertisement "attempts" to influence public opinion by emphasizing the urgency of the situation and contrasting it with perceived weakness in U.S. policy. END OF SUMMARY.
