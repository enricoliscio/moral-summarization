Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a concise summary using those words.

Looking at the article, I'll start by reading through it to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "combustible," "stoke anxiety," "risks," "nuclear arms," "world tells," "apologetic," "strength," "swipe," "criticized," "apologetic," "volitile," "needs," "strength," "apologies," "swipe," "criticized," "apologetic," "volatile," "needs," "strength," "apologies." These words seem to carry moral weight as they relate to policies, risks, criticism, and strength.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible without making it too long. The ad is trying to create anxiety about Iran's nuclear capabilities, criticizing Obama's policy as apologetic. The group behind it is Republican-linked, spending money in Florida areas with large Jewish populations. Israel didn't approve the ad.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the ad's purpose, the quote from Netanyahu, the criticism of Obama, the group's background, the funding, and Israel's lack of involvement. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to convey the intended message clearly and concisely.

**SUMMARY:**  
A new advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to stoke anxiety about American policies in the Middle East, using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear ambitions. The ad features Netanyahu expressing concern over the world's delay in addressing the threat, while an announcer criticizes President Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. Produced by Secure America Now, a group linked to Republican strategists, the ad is part of a $500,000 campaign in key Florida areas. However, the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad, highlighting tensions over American leadership in the region. The ad reflects broader criticism of Obama's approach, emphasizing the need for American strength rather than apologies in dealing with volatile countries like Iran.
