SUMMARY: An advertisement set to run in Jewish-populated areas of Florida aims to stir concerns about American policies in the Middle East. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and criticizing those who urge Israel to wait and do nothing. An unseen announcer concludes the ad with a swipe at President Obama, suggesting that the world needs American strength rather than apologies. The ad is produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida. A senior Israeli official stated that the ad was not approved or consulted with the Israeli government.
