SUMMARY: A new political advertisement set to air in Florida, targeting Jewish voters, uses a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran to criticize President Obama's foreign policy. The ad, produced by a group called Secure America Now, suggests that Obama's approach to Iran is weak and apologetic, and that his policies could endanger Israel. The ad is designed to stoke fears and anxiety among Jewish voters about the potential threat of a nuclear Iran, and to portray Obama as ineffective in dealing with volatile countries in the Middle East. The Israeli government distanced itself from the ad, stating that it was not consulted and does not approve of its content. The use of Netanyahu's clip and the swipe at Obama highlight the combustible nature of Israel and Middle East policy in US presidential politics, where tactics like fear-mongering and guilt-by-association are often employed to sway voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
