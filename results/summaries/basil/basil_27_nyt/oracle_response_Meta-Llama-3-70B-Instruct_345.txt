SUMMARY:

A new advertisement attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East, particularly among Jewish populations in Florida. The ad features a news clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, saying "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's dramatic tone and unseen announcer conclude that "the world needs American strength, not apologies," a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama's foreign policy. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, is run by Republican strategists and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida. The Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad's message tells voters that the US needs to take a stronger stance in the region, implying that the current administration's approach is weak and apologetic.

END OF SUMMARY.
