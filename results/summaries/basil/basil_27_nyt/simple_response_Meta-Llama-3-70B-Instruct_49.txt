SUMMARY:

A new political advertisement is stirring controversy by using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear Iran to stoke anxiety among Jewish voters in Florida. The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack aim to create a sense of urgency, with Netanyahu questioning the wisdom of waiting for Iran to acquire nuclear arms. The announcer concludes by saying "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a clear jab at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans like Mitt Romney as being too apologetic towards volatile countries. The ad was produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists, and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in key Florida markets. Notably, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad's message implies that a stronger, more assertive American foreign policy is needed to protect Israel and the world from the threats of a nuclear Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
