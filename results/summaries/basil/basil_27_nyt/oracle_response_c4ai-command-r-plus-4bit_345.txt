SUMMARY: A new political advertisement attempts to stoke fears among Florida's Jewish voters by highlighting the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's progressing nuclear capabilities, with dramatic effect. It concludes with an announcer taking a swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, criticizing his perceived apologetic approach towards volatile countries like Iran. The ad is produced by a group called Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, and will air in Florida markets with large Jewish populations. The ad reserves no apologies for its attempt to influence voters by stoking anxiety over America's Iran policy, a move the Israeli government did not approve.
END OF SUMMARY.
