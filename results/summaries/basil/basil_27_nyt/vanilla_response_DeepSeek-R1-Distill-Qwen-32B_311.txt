Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about an advertisement in Florida targeting Jewish communities. The ad uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat and criticizes Obama's foreign policy. It's produced by a Republican group, Secure America Now, spending $500k in Florida areas. The Israeli government didn't approve it. I should make sure the summary is under 200 words, starts with SUMMARY: and ends with END OF SUMMARY. I'll keep it concise, highlighting the ad's purpose, the group behind it, and the Israeli government's stance. Also, mention the swipe at Obama and the funding details. Make sure it's clear and flows well.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida uses a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat to criticize President Obama's foreign policy. The ad, produced by the Republican-backed group Secure America Now, suggests the need for "American strength, not apologies," subtly criticizing Obama's approach to the Middle East. The group, led by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, has reserved $500,000 in airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. An Israeli official stated the government was not consulted on or approved of the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
