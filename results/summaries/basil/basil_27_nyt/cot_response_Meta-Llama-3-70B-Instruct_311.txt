SUMMARY:
A new advertisement is set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, stoking anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, emphasizing the importance of American strength in the region. The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack are meant to convey a sense of urgency, implying that President Obama's foreign policy is apologetic and weak. The ad's message is clear: the world needs American strength, not apologies. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, is run by Republican strategists and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida. Notably, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad's release is likely to fuel criticism of Obama's foreign policy as volatile and ineffective. END OF SUMMARY.
