Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a political ad targeting Jewish communities in Florida. The ad uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat and criticizes Obama's foreign policy. 

First, I'll identify the key points: the ad's purpose, its use of Netanyahu's clip, the message against Obama, the group behind it, and the funding. I should mention that the ad aims to create anxiety and support American strength. Also, note that the Israeli government wasn't involved.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the ad's purpose, then describe the content and its message. I'll include the group's background and funding, and mention the Israeli government's stance. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by emphasizing the criticism of Obama's policy and the implication of needing stronger leadership.

Let me structure it: introduce the ad, its content, the criticism of Obama, the group behind it, funding, and the Israeli government's lack of involvement. Keep it concise and clear, ensuring the moral elements are preserved.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to heighten concerns about American foreign policy in the Middle East. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the threat of a nuclear Iran, with a dramatic soundtrack emphasizing the urgency. The message, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," subtly criticizes President Obama's foreign policy, which Republicans like Mitt Romney have accused of being apologetic toward Iran. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists and former Carter aide Pat Caddell, has reserved $500,000 in airtime in key Florida areas. However, a senior Israeli official stated that the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
