SUMMARY:

A new advertisement, attempting to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East, is set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations. The ad features a news clip of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, stating "The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack are designed to create a sense of urgency, with Netanyahu asking "Wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad's message is clear: the world needs American strength, not apologies. This is a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama, whom Republicans have criticized for his allegedly apologetic foreign policy towards volatile countries like Iran. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida, despite the Israeli government not being consulted or approving the ad.

END OF SUMMARY.
