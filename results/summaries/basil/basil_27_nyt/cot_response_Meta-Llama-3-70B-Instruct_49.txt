SUMMARY:
A new advertisement, created by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists, is set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the "risks" of a nuclear Iran, stating that "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's "dramatic" soundtrack and Netanyahu's urgent tone are meant to stoke "anxiety" over American policies in the region. The ad's message is a clear "swipe" at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been "criticized" by Republicans like Mitt Romney as "apologetic" towards "volatile" countries like Iran. The ad concludes with the line "The world needs American strength, not apologies," implying that Obama's approach is weak. The Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. END OF SUMMARY.
