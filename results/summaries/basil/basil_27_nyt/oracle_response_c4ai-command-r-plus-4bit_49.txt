SUMMARY: In an attempt to stoke anxiety among Jewish voters in Florida over the threat of a nuclear Iran, a new advertisement features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's advancing nuclear capabilities. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, also takes a swipe at President Obama by criticizing his foreign policy as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. With a dramatic soundtrack and ominous messaging, the ad attempts to create a sense of urgency and imply that the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad is set to air in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, and the group has reserved $500,000 of airtime. While the ad uses Netanyahu's words to suggest a closer relationship between Israel and a potential nuclear Iran, a senior Israeli official has clarified that the government was not consulted and does not approve of the ad.

END OF SUMMARY.
