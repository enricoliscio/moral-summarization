Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to keep: attempts, stoke, closer, tells, apologies. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities, using Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is produced by Republican strategists and is critical of Obama's foreign policy.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the moral words. "Attempts" and "stoke" are used to describe the ad's purpose. "Closer" refers to Iran's progress towards nuclear arms. "Tells" is used when the world advises Israel to wait. "Apologies" is a criticism towards Obama's policy.

I'll structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with the ad's purpose, mention the use of Netanyahu's clip, the dramatic effect, and the criticism of Obama. Then note the producers and their background, the ad's spending, and Israel's lack of involvement.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while incorporating all the key moral terms. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East by using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad, produced by Republican strategists, includes Netanyahu's statement that Iran is getting "closer and closer to nuclear arms" and criticizes the world's advice to "wait," suggesting Israel should not delay action. The unseen announcer concludes, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a veiled criticism of President Obama's foreign policy, which Republicans like Mitt Romney have labeled as apologetic. The ad, costing $500,000, is being aired in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. A senior Israeli official stated the government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. END OF SUMMARY.
