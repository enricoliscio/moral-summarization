Okay, so I need to help this user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific words to focus on: attempts, stoke, closer, tells, apologies. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an ad in Florida targeting Jewish areas, using Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is produced by Republican strategists, costing $500k, and Israel didn't approve it. The moral words are key here, so I need to make sure they're included.

I should start by identifying the main elements: the ad's purpose, who made it, the message, and the criticism. The ad uses Netanyahu's clip to create anxiety, which ties into "stoke." The message warns about Iran getting closer to nuclear arms, so "closer" is important. The announcer's line about needing strength, not apologies, directly targets Obama's foreign policy, so "apologies" is crucial.

I need to structure the summary to include these words naturally. Also, I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each moral term is present and the summary flows logically. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: A new advertisement in Florida, targeting areas with large Jewish populations, attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat, stating, "Every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." A dramatic soundtrack accompanies the clip, emphasizing the urgency. The announcer concludes, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a direct criticism of President Obama's foreign policy, which Republicans like Mitt Romney have labeled as apologetic. The ad was produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists, and has reserved $500,000 in airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. However, a senior Israeli official confirmed that the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
