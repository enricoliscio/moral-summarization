SUMMARY:

A new political advertisement is set to air in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, aiming to stir anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the risks of a nuclear Iran, with a dramatic soundtrack playing in the background. The ad concludes with the message "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a clear criticism of President Obama's foreign policy. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, is led by Republican strategists and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. Notably, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad is seen as a swipe at Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
