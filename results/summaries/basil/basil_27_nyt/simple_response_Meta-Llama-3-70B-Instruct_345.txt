SUMMARY:

A new political ad is stirring controversy in Florida, targeting Jewish populations and stoking anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the dangers of a nuclear Iran, with a dramatic soundtrack and an unseen announcer concluding that "The world needs American strength, not apologies." This is a clear swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans like Mitt Romney as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The ad is produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former Jimmy Carter aide turned Fox News contributor. Notably, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad's message is clear: American strength and leadership are needed to counter the threats of Iran, and President Obama's approach is seen as weak and ineffective.

END OF SUMMARY.
