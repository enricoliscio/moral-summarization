SUMMARY:
A new advertisement running in areas with large Jewish populations in Florida aims to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, saying "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack are meant to convey a sense of urgency, implying that the world needs American strength, not apologies. This is a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans like Mitt Romney as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The ad's creators, Secure America Now, have reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida, despite the Israeli government not being consulted or approving the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
