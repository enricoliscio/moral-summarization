SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish populations in Florida aims to stoke fears about a nuclear Iran and criticize President Obama's foreign policy. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and criticizing those who say there is still time to act. An unseen announcer then states that the world needs American strength, not apologies, referring to criticism from Mitt Romney and Republicans about Obama's alleged apologetic foreign policy. The ad is produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, and will air in Florida markets for $500,000. A senior Israeli official stated that the ad was not approved or consulted by the Israeli government.
END OF SUMMARY.
