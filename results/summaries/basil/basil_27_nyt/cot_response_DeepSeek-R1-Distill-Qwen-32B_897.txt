Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an advertisement in Florida targeting Jewish communities, using Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is produced by a Republican group, Secure America Now, and it's critical of Obama's foreign policy, implying weakness. 

For step one, I have to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. Let me go through the article again. Words like "combustible" suggest something dangerous or explosive. "Stoke anxiety" is about creating fear or worry. "Risks" implies danger. "Nuclear arms" is a threat. "World tells Israel, 'Wait. There's still time.' And I say wait for what? Wait until when?" This shows Netanyahu's urgency, so "urgency" is a moral frame. "American strength" is contrasted with "apologies," which implies weakness. "Apologetic" is a negative trait. "Volatile" countries like Iran are unstable. "Republican strategists" might imply partisanship. "Former aide" could relate to loyalty or betrayal. "Fox News contributor" ties to media bias. "Reserved $500,000" shows investment in influence. "Not consulted" and "did not approve" suggest lack of transparency or betrayal. 

Wait, I need to make sure each word is a single word and morally framed. So I'll list each one:

- combustible
- stoke
- anxiety
- risks
- nuclear
- urgency
- strength
- apologies
- apologetic
- volatile
- strategists
- former
- contributor
- reserved
- consulted
- approved

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. I should mention the ad, its purpose, the quote from Netanyahu, the soundtrack for drama, the criticism of Obama, the group behind it, their investment, and the Israeli government's lack of involvement. 

Putting it all together, I'll start by stating the ad's purpose, include Netanyahu's quote, mention the group and their intent, the investment, and the Israeli government's stance. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to convey the intended message.

**Summary:**

The ad features Netanyahu stating, "Every day, Iran gets closer to nuclear arms," with dramatic music heightening the urgency. It criticizes President Obama's foreign policy as apologetic, implying weakness, a critique echoed by Republicans. Produced by Secure America Now, a group led by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, the ad has invested $500,000 in Florida media. However, the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad, highlighting concerns over transparency and influence. END OF SUMMARY.
