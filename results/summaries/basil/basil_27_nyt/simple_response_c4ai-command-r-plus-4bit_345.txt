SUMMARY: An incendiary advertisement will run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, attempting to manipulate voters by stoking anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad uses a news clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran to criticize President Obama's foreign policy. The ad is produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, and it has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida markets. This underhanded tactic preys on people's fears and attempts to sway their votes by exploiting concerns about national security. It is a blatant attempt to manipulate public opinion and a disturbing example of how low some groups will stoop to try to influence an election. The Israeli government has distanced itself from the ad, stating that it was not consulted and does not approve of its content. This shady and deceptive tactic highlights the importance of voters being vigilant in separating fact from manipulative fiction.
END OF SUMMARY.
