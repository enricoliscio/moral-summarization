Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a news article about a political ad targeting Jewish communities in Florida, using Netanyahu's warnings about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is part of a campaign by Secure America Now, which is linked to Republican strategists, and it's criticizing Obama's foreign policy.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "combustible," "stoke anxiety," "risks," "nuclear arms," "apologetic," "strength," "swipe," "criticized," and "volatile" seem to have moral implications. These words are used to convey the ad's message about the dangers of Iran and the need for strong American leadership, contrasting with Obama's approach.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes these moral terms. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article, highlighting the ad's purpose, its creators, and the criticism it's aimed at. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll include words like "stoke anxiety," "apologetic," and "strength."

I should structure the summary to first mention the ad's purpose, then the creators, their background, the funding, and the criticism it's targeting. I'll also note that Israel didn't approve the ad. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is important.

Let me draft the summary: The ad aims to create anxiety about Iran's nuclear threat, using Netanyahu's warning. It's produced by Republican strategists and former Carter aide, targeting areas with large Jewish populations. The ad's message is a criticism of Obama's foreign policy, suggesting the need for American strength. Israel didn't approve the ad, and it's part of a broader political strategy.

I need to make sure all the key points are covered and the moral words are included. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. It looks good. Now, I'll present the step-by-step identification and then the summary as per the user's instructions.

**STEP 1:**

* swipe  
* criticized  
* volatile  

**SUMMARY:**  
A new political ad targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to stoke anxiety about Iran's nuclear threat, using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran. The ad, produced by Secure America Now, a group led by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, criticizes President Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. The ad's message, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," is a direct swipe at Obama, suggesting the need for stronger leadership. The ad's creators have reserved $500,000 in airtime in key Florida markets. However, a senior Israeli official stated that the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad reflects broader Republican criticism of Obama's approach to the Middle East, emphasizing the need for American strength to counter Iran's nuclear ambitions. END OF SUMMARY.
