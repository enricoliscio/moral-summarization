SUMMARY:

A new advertisement, set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features a news clip of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, saying "The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack are meant to evoke a sense of urgency, as Netanyahu asks, "Wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad's conclusion, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," is a clear swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans like Mitt Romney as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami, despite the Israeli government not being consulted or approving the ad.

END OF SUMMARY.
