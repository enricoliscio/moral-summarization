SUMMARY: A new political advertisement attempts to stoke anxiety over the Iran nuclear issue and criticize President Obama's foreign policy. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's progressing nuclear capabilities and expressing impatience with calls for Israel to wait for action. It concludes with a swipe at Obama, suggesting that "the world needs American strength, not apologies." The ad will run in Florida areas with large Jewish populations and is produced by a group run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter. While the ad attempts to exploit the issue for political gain, an Israeli official stated that the government was not consulted and did not approve its message.

END OF SUMMARY.
