SUMMARY: An advertisement set to run in Florida areas with large Jewish populations attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East by using a news clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the dangers of a nuclear Iran. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, includes a dramatic soundtrack and a swipe at President Obama, accusing him of being apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The ad reserves $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. It raises concerns about the proximity of Iran to developing nuclear arms and questions those who would have Israel wait, asking, "Wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad's message implies that the world needs American strength, not apologies, a clear criticism of Obama's foreign policy. While the ad uses Netanyahu's words, a senior Israeli official stated that the government was not consulted and did not approve the advertisement. END OF SUMMARY.
