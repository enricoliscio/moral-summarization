SUMMARY:

A new political advertisement is set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, aiming to stir anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the risks of a nuclear Iran, with a dramatic soundtrack. The ad concludes with the message "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a veiled criticism of President Obama's foreign policy. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, is run by Republican strategists and has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. Notably, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad is seen as a criticism of Obama's foreign policy, which has been labeled as "apologetic" by Republicans like Mitt Romney.

END OF SUMMARY.
