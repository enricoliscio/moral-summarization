SUMMARY:

A new advertisement attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East, particularly among Jewish populations in Florida. The ad features a news clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, stating that "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack are designed to create a sense of urgency, with Netanyahu asking, "Wait for what? Wait until when?" The announcer then concludes, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a clear swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans like Mitt Romney as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida, despite the Israeli government not being consulted or approving the ad.

END OF SUMMARY.
