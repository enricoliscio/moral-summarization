SUMMARY:

A new political advertisement is set to run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations, aiming to stir anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about the risks of a nuclear Iran, with a dramatic soundtrack. The ad concludes with the line "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a veiled criticism of President Obama's foreign policy. The ad is produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter. They have reserved $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. Notably, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it.

END OF SUMMARY.
