Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words: attempts, stoke, closer, tells, apologies. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a political ad targeting Jewish communities in Florida, using Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is produced by a Republican group, Secure America Now, and it's criticizing Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. The ad uses dramatic music and Netanyahu's quotes to create anxiety.

Now, I need to identify where the morally framed words fit. The ad "attempts" to stoke anxiety, so I'll use "attempts" and "stoke" early on. The ad shows Netanyahu saying Iran is getting "closer" to nuclear arms, so I'll include that. The line "The world tells Israel, 'Wait...'" uses "tells," so I'll incorporate that. The ad ends with a swipe at Obama, using the word "apologies."

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. I'll start by mentioning the ad's attempt to stoke anxiety, then describe the content with Netanyahu's quote about Iran getting closer. Then, I'll note the ad's criticism of Obama's policy as apologetic, using the word "apologies." I'll also mention the group behind the ad and their spending, as well as Israel's lack of involvement.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each moral word is included where appropriate without making it forced.

Finally, I'll review the summary to check that all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll make sure the words "attempts," "stoke," "closer," "tells," and "apologies" are all included naturally within the summary.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran’s nuclear threat, with Netanyahu stating, “Every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms.” Dramatic music underscores the clip, as Netanyahu questions the world’s call for Israel to “wait” and asks, “Wait until when?” The ad concludes with a critique of President Obama’s foreign policy, implying it is apologetic. Produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists, the ad has reserved $500,000 in airtime in key Florida markets. However, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad’s message is a direct attempt to highlight the need for American strength in the region, while subtly criticizing Obama’s approach. END OF SUMMARY.
