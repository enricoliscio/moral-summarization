Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about a political ad targeting Jewish areas in Florida. The ad uses Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat and criticizes Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. The group behind it is Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements. The ad is trying to create anxiety, so that's a key point. It's comparing Obama's approach to Romney's, implying weakness versus strength. Also, mentioning that Israel didn't approve the ad adds context about its legitimacy.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Start by stating it's a political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities. Mention Netanyahu's quote and the ad's goal to stoke anxiety. Include the swipe at Obama, the group's background, and the funding. End with Israel's lack of involvement.

Let me structure it: introduce the ad, its purpose, Netanyahu's quote, the criticism of Obama, the group's details, and Israel's stance. Keep it clear and within the word limit. Make sure the moral framing is evident, like the ad's attempt to manipulate emotions and the political strategy behind it.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida aims to stoke anxiety over American policy in the Middle East by using a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran’s nuclear threat. The ad, produced by the group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu stating, “The world tells Israel, ‘Wait. There’s still time.’ And I say wait for what? Wait until when?” A dramatic soundtrack accompanies the clip, heightening tension. The ad’s closing line, “The world needs American strength, not apologies,” is seen as a criticism of President Obama’s foreign policy, which Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have accused of being overly conciliatory toward Iran. The group behind the ad, run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, has reserved $500,000 in airtime in key Florida markets. However, a senior Israeli official stated that the Israeli government was neither consulted nor approved the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
