SUMMARY:
A new advertisement in Florida, targeting areas with large Jewish populations, aims to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, with a dramatic soundtrack. Netanyahu's message is clear: "Wait for what? Wait until when?" implying that the world is being too apologetic towards Iran. The ad concludes with the line "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama's foreign policy. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, is run by Republican strategists and has reserved $500,000 of airtime. Interestingly, the Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad's message is clear: American strength is needed, not apologies.

END OF SUMMARY.
