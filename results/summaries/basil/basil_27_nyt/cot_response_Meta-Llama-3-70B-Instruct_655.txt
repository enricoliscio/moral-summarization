SUMMARY:
A new advertisement, produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists, aims to stoke anxiety among Jewish populations in Florida by highlighting the risks of a nuclear Iran. The ad features Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the dangers of Iran's nuclear program, with a dramatic soundtrack to emphasize the urgency. The ad's message is a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans, including Mitt Romney, as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The ad concludes by emphasizing the need for American strength, rather than apologies. The Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it. The ad will run in areas with large Jewish populations, including Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami, with a reserved airtime of $500,000. END OF SUMMARY.
