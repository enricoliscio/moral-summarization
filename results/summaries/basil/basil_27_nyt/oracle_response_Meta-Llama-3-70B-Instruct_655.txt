SUMMARY:

A new advertisement attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East, particularly with regards to Iran's nuclear program. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran, stating "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." The ad's dramatic tone and soundtrack aim to create a sense of urgency, with Netanyahu questioning what the world is waiting for. The ad concludes with the line "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, which has been criticized by Republicans as apologetic towards volatile countries like Iran. The group behind the ad, Secure America Now, has reserved $500,000 of airtime in Florida, despite the Israeli government not being consulted or approving the ad.

END OF SUMMARY.
