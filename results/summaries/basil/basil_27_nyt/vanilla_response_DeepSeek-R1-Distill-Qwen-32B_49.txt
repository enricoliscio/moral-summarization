Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about a political ad targeting Jewish communities in Florida. The ad uses a clip of Netanyahu talking about Iran's nuclear threat. It's trying to make people anxious about American policy. The ad's message is that the world needs American strength, not apologies, which seems to criticize Obama's foreign policy as being too apologetic. The group behind the ad is Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists and a former Carter aide. They've spent $500k on airtime in Florida. The Israeli government wasn't consulted about the ad.

I should capture the key points: the ad's purpose, who made it, the criticism of Obama, the funding, and the Israeli government's stance. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is concise.

Let me structure it: start with the ad's purpose, mention Netanyahu's quote, the group behind it, their criticism of Obama, the funding details, and the Israeli government's lack of involvement.

I should avoid any extra details to keep it within the word limit. Make sure the summary flows well and includes all essential elements without being too wordy.
