Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about a new political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities. The ad uses a clip of Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat. It's produced by a group called Secure America Now, which is linked to Republican strategists. The ad is criticizing Obama's foreign policy as being too apologetic, suggesting the world needs American strength instead. Netanyahu's government didn't approve the ad, and it's running in areas with large Jewish populations.

I should make sure the summary captures the essence of the ad's message, the criticism of Obama, and the involvement of Republican strategists. Also, note that Israel didn't approve the ad. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral framing, which seems to be about the ad stoking anxiety and criticizing Obama's approach.

Let me structure the summary: start with the ad's purpose, mention Netanyahu's clip, the group behind it, the criticism of Obama, and the fact that Israel didn't approve. Keep it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement targeting Jewish communities in Florida uses a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat, aiming to stoke anxiety over American policies in the Middle East. The ad, produced by Secure America Now, a group linked to Republican strategists, criticizes President Obama's foreign policy as "apologetic" and advocates for "American strength." The ad's dramatic tone and message echo concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, while subtly attacking Obama's approach to the region. Netanyahu's government did not approve the ad, and it is set to air in areas with large Jewish populations. The ad reflects ongoing tensions over U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and the role of political messaging in shaping public perception. END OF SUMMARY.
