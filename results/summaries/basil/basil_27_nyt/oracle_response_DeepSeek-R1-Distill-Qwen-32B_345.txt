Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words: attempts, stoke, closer, tells, apologies. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about a political ad in Florida targeting Jewish communities, using Netanyahu's warning about Iran's nuclear threat. The ad is produced by a Republican group, aiming to criticize Obama's foreign policy as apologetic. 

I need to include the key elements: the ad's purpose, the use of Netanyahu's quote, the dramatic effect with the soundtrack, the swipe at Obama, and the producers' background. Also, mention that Israel didn't approve the ad.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral words. "Attempts" can describe the ad's purpose. "Stoke anxiety" fits the goal. "Closer" is used in Netanyahu's quote. "Tells" is part of the ad's message. "Apologies" is the criticism towards Obama.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring all points are covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: A new political advertisement in Florida, targeting areas with large Jewish populations, attempts to stoke anxiety about American policies in the Middle East. The ad uses a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear threat, emphasizing that "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms." A dramatic soundtrack accompanies the clip, heightening tension. The ad concludes with the message, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," a clear criticism of President Obama's foreign policy, which Republicans like Mitt Romney have labeled as apologetic. The ad was produced by Secure America Now, a group run by Republican strategists and former aides, who have reserved $500,000 in airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Miami. However, a senior Israeli official stated that the Israeli government was not consulted on or approved of the ad. END OF SUMMARY.
