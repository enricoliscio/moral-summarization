SUMMARY: A new political advertisement attempts to stoke anxiety among Jewish populations in Florida over the potential threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. The ad features a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning about Iran's progressing nuclear capabilities and criticizing the notion of waiting for action. The unseen announcer concludes by taking a swipe at President Obama's foreign policy, criticizing his perceived apologies to volatile countries like Iran. The ad is produced by the group Secure America Now, run by Republican strategists and a former aide to Jimmy Carter, and will air in several Florida markets for $500,000. The Israeli government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve its message. The use of Netanyahu's clip and the swipe at Obama's alleged apologies are attempts to create anxiety and influence voters' perceptions of the president's foreign policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
