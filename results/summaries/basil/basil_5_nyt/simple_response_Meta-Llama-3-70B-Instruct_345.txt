SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that this is not a blanket accusation of racism against the entire Tea Party movement, but rather a demand for accountability and responsibility. He urged Tea Party groups to distance themselves from known hate groups and to make it clear that there is no place for bigotry within their movement. The resolution was met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog." The NAACP's move comes amidst allegations of racism within the Tea Party movement, which its leaders deny. The moral imperative is clear: with increased power and influence comes the responsibility to act responsibly and to reject bigotry and hate.
