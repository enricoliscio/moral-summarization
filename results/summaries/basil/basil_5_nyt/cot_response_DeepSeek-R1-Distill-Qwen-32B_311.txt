Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand what the user is asking for. They provided an article about the NAACP passing a resolution regarding the Tea Party groups. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary using those words as much as possible.

Alright, starting with the first step: identifying morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "racist," "hate," "silence," "violence," "bigots," "partisan," "attack dog," "exempt," "allegations," "spitting," and "racism" come to mind. These words are used to convey judgment or moral evaluation in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the NAACP's resolution, the call for Tea Party groups to address racist elements, and the president's statement about not labeling the entire movement as racist but urging responsibility. Then, I'll note the backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, including Sarah Palin's response and the St. Louis Tea Party's resolution accusing the NAACP. I'll also include the allegations of racism against the Tea Party movement and their denial of such claims.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too lengthy. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the original article's tone and framing. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each point is clear and concise.

**STEP 1:**  
* racist  
* hate  
* silence  
* violence  
* bigots  
* partisan  
* attack dog  
* exempt  
* allegations  
* spitting  
* racism  

**SUMMARY:**  
The NAACP passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks, emphasizing the need for the movement to distance itself from hate groups. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous clarified that the resolution was not to label the entire Tea Party as racist but to urge responsibility, as increased public attention and power bring accountability. He stressed the importance of rejecting bigots within the movement. However, Tea Party groups and supporters strongly opposed the resolution. Sarah Palin defended the Tea Party, urging the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP, while the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition accused the NAACP of acting as a "partisan political attack dog" and called for a review of its tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced allegations of racism, including incidents of racial epithets and spitting directed at black congress members. The movement denies these claims, insisting there is no racism within its ranks.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
