SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but to encourage them to distance themselves from known hate groups. NAACP president Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that the Tea Party movement has a responsibility to act responsibly and make clear that there is no place for bigotry within their ranks. The resolution was not well-received by Tea Party groups and their supporters, who denied any racism within the movement. Sarah Palin defended the Tea Party and called on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued a resolution against the NAACP, accusing them of partisanship and calling for a review of their tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced allegations of racism, particularly during protests against health care legislation, but has denied any presence of racism within the movement. END OF SUMMARY.
