Alright, so the user has provided a query where they want me to summarize a news article. The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution regarding the Tea Party groups. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

First, the NAACP, being a significant civil rights organization, has called on Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. This happened at their annual convention in Kansas City. The president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, clarified that the resolution isn't labeling the entire Tea Party as racist but wants them to distance themselves from hate groups. He emphasizes responsibility due to their increased influence and mentions that silence can lead to violence.

On the flip side, Tea Party groups and supporters aren't happy. Sarah Palin stepped in to defend them, asking the Obamas to address the issue. Another Tea Party group accused the NAACP of being partisan and even suggested reviewing their tax status. There have been past allegations of racism in the Tea Party, like racial slurs and spitting incidents during protests.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: NAACP's resolution, Jealous's clarification, the reaction from Tea Party supporters, Palin's involvement, the counter-resolution, and the context of past racism allegations.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the NAACP's action, then their stance, followed by the reactions, and end with the broader context. Keeping it concise but informative is key. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me make sure I cover all these points without exceeding the word limit. I'll need to be precise and avoid any unnecessary details. Maybe start with the resolution, mention Jealous's points, then the reactions, and wrap up with the history of allegations. That should cover everything succinctly.
