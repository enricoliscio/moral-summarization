SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest civil rights groups in the US, has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was approved by delegates at the NAACP's annual convention, with president Benjamin Todd Jealous stating that it was not an attempt to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but rather to encourage them to distance themselves from known hate groups. Jealous emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party movement to act responsibly and condemn bigotry within their ranks. The resolution has sparked backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued a resolution against the NAACP, accusing them of partisanship and calling for a review of their tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced persistent allegations of racism, particularly after incidents of racial epithets and physical assaults directed at black members of Congress during a health care legislation vote. Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within the movement.
