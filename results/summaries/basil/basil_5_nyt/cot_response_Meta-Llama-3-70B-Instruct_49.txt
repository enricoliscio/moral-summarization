SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that the resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as "racist", but rather to urge them to take "responsibility" and distance themselves from known hate groups. Jealous warned that "silence" in the face of racism can lead to "violence", and that it's time for the Tea Party to say "enough is enough" and make it clear that there's no place for "bigots" in their movement. The resolution was met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the Tea Party and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog".
