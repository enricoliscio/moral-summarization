SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) has called on Tea Party groups to take a stand against racism within their ranks, demanding that they act responsibly and make it clear that there is no place for bigotry in their movement. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., emphasized the need for the Tea Party to distance itself from known hate groups that encourage their members to join, stating that the consequence of silence is violence. The resolution has sparked controversy, with Tea Party groups denying any racism within their movement and accusing the N.A.A.C.P. of partisan politics. This comes in the wake of allegations of racism against Tea Party protesters, including the hurling of racial epithets and spitting on a congressman. The N.A.A.C.P. is standing firm in its call for the Tea Party to weed out racist elements and for its leaders to set the record straight.
