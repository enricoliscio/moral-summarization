SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that this is not a blanket label of racism, but rather a demand for Tea Party groups to distance themselves from known "hate groups" that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. Jealous urged the Tea Party to act "responsibly" and reject "bigots", warning that "silence" can lead to "violence". The resolution was met with opposition from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the Tea Party movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog". The NAACP's move comes amidst allegations of racism within the Tea Party, which the movement denies. END OF SUMMARY.
