Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution urging Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They're concerned that some Tea Party groups are associated with hate groups. The NAACP's president, Benjamin Jealous, clarifies that they're not labeling the entire Tea Party as racist but wants them to distance themselves from these groups. He mentions that with more attention and power, comes responsibility. He also warns that silence can lead to violence, so they need to take a stand against bigots in the movement.

On the other side, Tea Party supporters like Sarah Palin are defending the movement, calling on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. Some Tea Party groups have accused the NAACP of being partisan and even suggested reviewing their tax-exempt status. There have been allegations of racism in the Tea Party, like racial epithets and spitting incidents during protests.

So, the moral framing here is about responsibility and accountability. The NAACP is emphasizing that groups with influence must take action against hate, while the Tea Party is countering by accusing the NAACP of bias and defending their own stance against racism.

I need to capture both perspectives and the moral implications. The summary should mention the resolution, the NAACP's stance, the response from Tea Party supporters, and the allegations of racism. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspects are clear.

Let me structure this: start with the NAACP's action, their reasoning, the response from Tea Party and Palin, the counter-accusations, and the context of racism allegations. Make sure to highlight the moral arguments on both sides.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
