SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. While the N.A.A.C.P. president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, maintains that they are not labeling the entire Tea Party movement as racist, he asserts that the groups must do more to distance themselves from known hate groups that encourage members to join. The resolution has sparked backlash from Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the N.A.A.C.P. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even issued a resolution against the N.A.A.C.P., accusing them of partisanship and suggesting a review of their tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced persistent accusations of racism, particularly after black members of Congress reported racial epithets and physical assaults during health care legislation protests. Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within their movement. The N.A.A.C.P.'s resolution aims to hold the movement accountable for its association with hate groups and to encourage them to take a stand against bigotry and violence. END OF SUMMARY.
