SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest and largest civil rights groups in the nation, passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to take a stand against racist elements within their ranks. The resolution was not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but to encourage them to distance themselves from hate groups that encourage their members to join. Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party movement to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. He stated that silence can lead to violence and that it is crucial to make it clear that there is no place for racism in the movement. The resolution was met with criticism from Tea Party groups and their supporters, who denied the presence of racism within the movement. Accusations of racism have been directed at the Tea Party movement in the past, particularly during the health care legislation protests when black members of Congress reported being subjected to racial epithets and spitting. The NAACP's resolution aims to hold the Tea Party movement accountable and encourage them to actively reject racist and violent elements.
