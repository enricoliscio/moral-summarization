SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was prompted by concerns over the presence of known hate groups within the Tea Party movement and the need for them to distance themselves from such associations. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., emphasized that the resolution was not a blanket accusation of racism against the entire Tea Party but a call for responsibility and denouncement of bigotry. However, the resolution faced strong backlash from Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the N.A.A.C.P. The Tea Party has faced persistent accusations of racism, particularly after incidents where black members of Congress were subjected to racial slurs and spitting during health care legislation protests. Tea Party groups vehemently deny the presence of racism within their movement.
