SUMMARY: In an effort to uphold moral standards and promote racial equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) took a stand against racist elements within the Tea Party movement. The N.A.A.C.P. passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel racist individuals and hate groups from their ranks. Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P., emphasized that the resolution was not meant to label all Tea Party members as racist, but to hold the movement accountable for its association with known hate groups. He argued that silence in the face of bigotry can lead to violence and that it is the responsibility of the Tea Party to clearly denounce racism. However, the resolution was met with backlash from Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, who accused the N.A.A.C.P. of partisanship. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even went as far as to call for the N.A.A.C.P.'s tax-exempt status to be reviewed. This incident highlights the ongoing struggle between upholding moral values and the complex dynamics of political movements in the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
