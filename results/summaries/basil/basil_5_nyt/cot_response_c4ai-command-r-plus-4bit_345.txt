SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was prompted by concerns over the presence of known hate groups within the Tea Party movement and the need for the groups to distance themselves from such associations. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the NAACP, emphasized that the resolution was not a blanket accusation of racism towards the entire Tea Party movement but a call for increased responsibility and denouncement of bigotry. The resolution faced backlash from Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even went as far as to accuse the NAACP of partisan politics and suggested reviewing the group's tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced persistent allegations of racism, particularly in relation to the experiences of black members of Congress who faced racial epithets and physical assaults during a health care vote. While Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within their movement, the NAACP's resolution highlights the importance of actively condemning bigotry and promoting inclusivity. END OF SUMMARY.
