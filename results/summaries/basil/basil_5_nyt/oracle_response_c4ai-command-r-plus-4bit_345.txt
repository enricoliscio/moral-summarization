SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was not an attempt to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but it highlighted the need for these groups to distance themselves from known hate groups. Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party movement to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. He stated that silence in the face of racism can lead to violence. The resolution faced backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, who denied the presence of racism within the movement. Accusations of racism have been leveled against the Tea Party in the past, with black members of Congress alleging that protesters hurled racial epithets and even spat on a congressman. Tea Party groups have refuted these claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
