SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution, approved at the NAACP's annual convention, does not label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but urges them to distance themselves from known hate groups. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that the Tea Party must take responsibility for their actions and make it clear that there is no place for bigots in their movement. The resolution was met with opposition from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the Tea Party movement and called on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even issued a counter-resolution, accusing the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog" and calling for a review of their tax-exempt status.

END OF SUMMARY.
