SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks, sparking controversy and backlash from Tea Party supporters. N.A.A.C.P. president Benjamin Todd Jealous clarified that the resolution was not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist but to hold them accountable for the presence of known hate groups within their ranks. Jealous emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party to denounce bigotry and distance themselves from these hate groups. The resolution was met with criticism from Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the N.A.A.C.P. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even issued a resolution against the N.A.A.C.P., accusing them of partisanship and questioning their tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced persistent allegations of racism, particularly after incidents of racial epithets and violence directed at black members of Congress. Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within the movement. END OF SUMMARY.
