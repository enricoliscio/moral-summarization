SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution comes in response to allegations of racism within the Tea Party movement, including accusations of racial epithets and spitting directed at black members of Congress. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., emphasized that the resolution is not a condemnation of the entire Tea Party but a call for responsibility and a stand against hate groups. He stated that silence in the face of bigotry can lead to violence. However, the resolution has been met with backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, who deny the presence of racism within their movement. Sarah Palin defended the Tea Party and called for the Obamas to rebuke the N.A.A.C.P., while the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition accused the civil rights group of partisanship and suggested a review of their tax-exempt status. The N.A.A.C.P.'s resolution highlights the ongoing debate over the presence of racist elements within the Tea Party and the need for a clear stance against bigotry and hate. END OF SUMMARY.
