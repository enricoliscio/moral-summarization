SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to "weed out" racist elements from their ranks. The resolution is not intended to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but rather to urge them to take responsibility and distance themselves from known hate groups. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that with increased power comes the responsibility to act responsibly and stand up against bigotry. He warned that silence in the face of racism can lead to violence. The resolution has been met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog." The Tea Party movement has faced allegations of racism, including reports of racial epithets and spitting on a congressman. The NAACP is calling on the Tea Party to make it clear that there is no place for bigots in their movement. END OF SUMMARY.
