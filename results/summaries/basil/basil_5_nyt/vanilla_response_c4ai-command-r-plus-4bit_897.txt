SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest and largest civil rights groups in the US, passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was not intended to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but to encourage them to distance themselves from known hate groups. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party movement to act responsibly and condemn bigotry within their ranks. However, the resolution was met with backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, who denied the presence of racism within the movement. Sarah Palin defended the Tea Party and called on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even issued a resolution against the NAACP, accusing them of partisan politics and questioning their tax-exempt status. The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between civil rights groups and the Tea Party movement, with allegations of racism persisting despite denials from Tea Party groups. END OF SUMMARY.
