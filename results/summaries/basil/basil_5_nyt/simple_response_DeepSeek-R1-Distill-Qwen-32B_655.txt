Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the NAACP passing a resolution urging Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They did this at their annual convention. The president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, clarified that they don't consider the entire Tea Party racist, but they need to distance themselves from hate groups. He emphasized responsibility because of the increased attention and power the Tea Party has. He also mentioned that silence could lead to violence, so they need to take a stand.

On the other side, Tea Party groups and supporters are not happy. Sarah Palin defended them, asking the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. Another Tea Party group accused the NAACP of being partisan and even suggested reviewing their tax-exempt status. There have been allegations of racism against the Tea Party, like racial epithets and spitting incidents during protests. The Tea Party denies any racism within their movement.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. So I need to highlight the NAACP's call for accountability, the Tea Party's response, and the context of racism allegations. I should make sure to include both perspectives without taking sides, just presenting the facts as they are framed in the article.

I should structure the summary by starting with the NAACP's action, then Jealous's clarifications, followed by the Tea Party's reactions, and end with the context of the allegations. Keeping it concise but covering all key points.
