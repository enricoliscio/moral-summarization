SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but rather to urge them to distance themselves from known hate groups that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that with increased power comes the responsibility to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. The resolution has been met with opposition from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has also issued a resolution against the NAACP, accusing them of being a "partisan political attack dog" and calling for a review of their tax-exempt status.

END OF SUMMARY.
