Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP passed a resolution asking Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They emphasized that the resolution isn't labeling the entire Tea Party as racist but urged them to distance from hate groups. The president, Benjamin Jealous, stressed responsibility and the consequences of silence leading to violence. 

Tea Party groups and supporters reacted negatively. Sarah Palin defended them, and a Tea Party coalition accused the NAACP of being partisan and suggested reviewing their tax status. The article also mentions past allegations of racism against Tea Party members, like hurling epithets and spitting. The Tea Party denies any racism.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: responsibly, violence, stand, clear, acting, review, racism, hurling, spitting. I'll structure the summary to highlight the NAACP's call for responsibility, the consequences of inaction, the reactions from Tea Party supporters, and the accusations of racism. I'll make sure to use the specified words where appropriate without making the summary too long. Let me draft it concisely, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.
