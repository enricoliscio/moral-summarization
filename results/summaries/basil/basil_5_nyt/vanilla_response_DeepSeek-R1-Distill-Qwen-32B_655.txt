Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They approved this at their annual convention in Kansas City. The NAACP's president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, clarifies that they're not labeling the entire Tea Party as racist, but they need to distance themselves from hate groups. He mentions that with more attention and power, there's a responsibility to act responsibly, and silence could lead to violence.

The Tea Party response is negative. Sarah Palin defended them, calling on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. A Tea Party group in St. Louis issued their own resolution accusing the NAACP of being partisan and even suggesting an IRS review of their tax status. The article also mentions past allegations of racism against the Tea Party, including racial epithets and spitting incidents, which the Tea Party denies.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, their stance, Jealous's clarifications, the Tea Party's response, and the context of past allegations. I'll make sure to keep it concise and include all key points without getting too detailed. Also, I'll structure it to flow logically from the NAACP's resolution to the reactions and background. I'll end with the fact that the Tea Party denies racism. That should cover everything succinctly.
