SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) has called on Tea Party groups to take a stand against racism within their ranks, demanding that they act responsibly and make it clear that there is no place for bigotry in their movement. The resolution, passed on Tuesday, comes in response to allegations of racism that have plagued the Tea Party movement, including reports of racial epithets and even spitting directed at black members of Congress. While Tea Party groups deny any racism within their ranks, the N.A.A.C.P. asserts that known hate groups are actively encouraging their members to join the Tea Party, and that the movement has a responsibility to distance itself from these elements. The resolution has sparked backlash from Tea Party supporters, who accuse the N.A.A.C.P. of partisan politics and even call for a review of their tax-exempt status. The N.A.A.C.P.'s president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasizes that the resolution is not a condemnation of the entire Tea Party movement, but a call for increased responsibility to prevent the silence that can lead to violence.
