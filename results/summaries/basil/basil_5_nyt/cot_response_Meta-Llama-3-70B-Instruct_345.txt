SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as "racist," but rather to urge them to distance themselves from known "hate groups" that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. Jealous stressed that with increased power comes the "responsibility to act responsibly" and to condemn "bigots" within their ranks. The resolution was met with opposition from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the Tea Party movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog." The controversy highlights ongoing allegations of "racism" within the Tea Party movement, which its supporters deny. END OF SUMMARY.
