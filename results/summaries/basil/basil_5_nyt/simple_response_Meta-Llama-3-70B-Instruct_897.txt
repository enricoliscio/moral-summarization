SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but rather to urge them to take responsibility for distancing themselves from known hate groups that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that with increased power comes the responsibility to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. The resolution has been met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The Tea Party has been accused of racism since allegations of racial epithets and spitting on a congressman during a health care protest. The NAACP's resolution is a moral imperative, urging the Tea Party to take a stand against hate and bigotry.
