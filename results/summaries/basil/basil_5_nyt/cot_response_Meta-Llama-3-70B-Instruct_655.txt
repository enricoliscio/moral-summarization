SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to distance themselves from known "racist elements" and "hate groups" that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as "racist", but rather to urge them to take responsibility and act responsibly by condemning "bigots" within their ranks. The NAACP argues that "silence" in the face of racism can lead to "violence", and it's time for the Tea Party to say "enough is enough" and make it clear that there is no place for "racist" ideologies within their movement. The resolution has been met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, who deny allegations of racism within their movement. END OF SUMMARY.
