Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution targeting Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. I should start by identifying the main points: the NAACP's action, their stance, Benjamin Jealous's comments, the reaction from Tea Party groups and supporters like Sarah Palin, and the accusations of racism within the Tea Party.

I should make sure to highlight the NAACP's concern about the Tea Party distancing themselves from hate groups, not labeling the entire movement as racist. Jealous's emphasis on responsibility and the consequences of silence is important. Also, the Tea Party's response, including the St. Louis resolution and Palin's defense, shows the opposing viewpoint.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral implications on both sides. The NAACP is calling for accountability, while the Tea Party denies racism and accuses the NAACP of partisanship. I'll structure the summary to reflect this back-and-forth, maintaining the original moral framing without taking sides.

NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous clarified that the resolution does not label the entire Tea Party as racist but urged the groups to distance themselves from known hate organizations. He stressed that with increased public attention and power comes the responsibility to act responsibly, warning that silence could lead to violence. The resolution sparked strong reactions, with Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, defending the movement and accusing the NAACP of partisan bias. The Tea Party has faced allegations of racism, particularly after incidents involving racial epithets and spitting during protests. Tea Party groups deny racism and have accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog." END OF SUMMARY.
