SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest and largest civil rights groups in the US, has taken a stand against racism within the Tea Party movement by passing a resolution calling for the weeding out of "racist elements". The resolution was not intended to label the entire Tea Party as racist, but rather to encourage them to distance themselves from known hate groups that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. The NAACP's president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party to act responsibly and condemn bigotry within their ranks. However, the resolution was not well-received by Tea Party groups and their supporters, who denied any racism within the movement and accused the NAACP of being partisan. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions between civil rights groups and the Tea Party movement, with the latter facing allegations of racism and hate speech. 
END OF SUMMARY.
