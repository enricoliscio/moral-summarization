Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution regarding the Tea Party groups. Let me read through it again to understand the key points.

The NAACP, a major civil rights group, passed a resolution urging Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They don't want to label the entire movement as racist, but they want them to distance themselves from hate groups. Benjamin Todd Jealous, their president, mentions that with more attention and power, comes responsibility. He emphasizes the need to stand against bigotry.

On the flip side, Tea Party supporters are upset. Sarah Palin called on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP, and a Tea Party coalition accused the NAACP of being partisan and even suggested reviewing their tax status. There have been allegations of racism in the Tea Party, like racial slurs and spitting incidents during protests. The Tea Party denies any racism within their movement.

So, the summary needs to capture both sides: the NAACP's call for accountability and the Tea Party's pushback. I should mention the resolution, the NAACP's stance, the response from Tea Party supporters, and the context of racism allegations. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral aspects are clear, like the responsibility to act against hate and the accusations of partisanship.

Let me structure it: start with the NAACP's action, their reasoning, the president's statement, then the Tea Party's reactions, and the context of racism allegations. Make sure it's balanced and includes both perspectives.

I should avoid any markdown and just write a straightforward summary. Let me check the word count to stay within limits. Also, ensure that the moral framing is preserved, highlighting the call for responsibility and the accusations against the NAACP.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and concise.
