SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was prompted by concerns over the presence of known hate groups within the Tea Party movement and the need for the groups to distance themselves from such associations. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the NAACP, emphasized that the resolution was not a blanket accusation of racism against the entire Tea Party movement but a call for responsibility and denouncement of bigotry. However, the resolution was met with backlash from Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and criticized the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition went as far as accusing the NAACP of partisan politics and calling for a review of its tax-exempt status. The controversy surrounding the Tea Party movement and racism came to a head when black members of Congress alleged that they were subjected to racial epithets and even physical assault during a health care legislation vote. While Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within their movement, the NAACP resolution underscores the importance of addressing these issues to prevent further incidents of racial discrimination and violence.
