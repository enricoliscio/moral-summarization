SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest and largest civil rights groups in the US, passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was not intended to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but to encourage them to distance themselves from hate groups that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. However, the resolution was not well-received by Tea Party groups and their supporters, who denied the presence of racism within the movement and accused the NAACP of political partisanship. This controversy highlights the ongoing debate over racism within the Tea Party, with incidents of racial epithets and violence reported by black members of Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
