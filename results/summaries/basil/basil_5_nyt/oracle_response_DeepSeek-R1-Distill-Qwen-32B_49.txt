Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the NAACP passing a resolution urging Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They mention that the resolution isn't labeling the entire Tea Party as racist but wants them to distance from hate groups. The president of NAACP, Benjamin Jealous, emphasizes responsibility and the consequence of silence leading to violence. The Tea Party groups and supporters, like Sarah Palin and the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition, are reacting negatively, accusing the NAACP of being partisan and even suggesting a tax review. There are allegations of racism within the Tea Party, including racial slurs and spitting incidents.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words are: responsibly, violence, stand, clear, acting, review, racism, hurling, spitting. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I should start by stating the NAACP's action, using "responsibly" and "racism." Then, mention Jealous's points about responsibility and the consequence of silence leading to violence. Include the Tea Party's reactions, using "review" and "racism." Also, note the allegations of "hurling" and "spitting."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: introduce the resolution, Jealous's stance, Tea Party's response, and the allegations. Make sure each moral word is contextually placed.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points and moral words are included without exceeding the word limit.

He urged the movement to stand clear and reject bigots. Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, have criticized the NAACP, accusing it of acting as a partisan political attack dog and calling for a review of its tax-exempt status.
