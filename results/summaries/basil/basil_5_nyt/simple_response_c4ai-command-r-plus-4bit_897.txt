SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest and largest civil rights groups in the US, has taken a stand against racism within the Tea Party movement. The NAACP passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks, not intending to brand the entire movement as racist but sending a clear message that hate groups and bigotry have no place within it. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the NAACP, emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party to act against racism, especially with the increased attention and power it has gained. However, the resolution was not well-received by Tea Party groups and their supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and criticized the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even went as far as to accuse the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog." This incident highlights the ongoing struggle against racism in American politics and the need for all groups to actively promote inclusivity and respect. END OF SUMMARY.
