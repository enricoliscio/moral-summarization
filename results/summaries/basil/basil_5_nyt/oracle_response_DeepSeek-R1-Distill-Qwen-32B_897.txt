Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words to include are: responsibly, violence, stand, clear, acting, review, racism, hurling, spitting.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP passed a resolution urging Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They emphasized responsibility and avoiding violence. The Tea Party responded by accusing the NAACP of partisanship and suggesting a tax review. There are allegations of racism within the Tea Party, including hurling epithets and spitting.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start with the NAACP's action, mention the resolution, and their stance on responsibility and violence. Then, include the Tea Party's response, using words like 'acting' and'review.' Finally, note the allegations of racism, using 'hurling' and'spitting.'

I should make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring clarity and conciseness without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP has called on Tea Party groups to "weed out racist elements" and act responsibly, emphasizing that their increased public attention and power come with the responsibility to distance themselves from hate groups. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that silence could lead to violence, urging the Tea Party to "stand up and say enough is enough" and make it clear that there is no place for bigots in their movement. However, Tea Party groups and supporters strongly反对, with Sarah Palin accusing the NAACP of partisanship and calling for the Obamas to rebuke them. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued a resolution accusing the NAACP of acting as a "partisan political attack dog" and called for a review of the group’s tax-exempt status. The Tea Party has faced allegations of racism, including accusations of members hurling racial epithets and spitting on a congressman. The movement denies any racism within its ranks.  
END OF SUMMARY.
