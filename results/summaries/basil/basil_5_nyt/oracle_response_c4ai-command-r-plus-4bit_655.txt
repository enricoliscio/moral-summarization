SUMMARY: One of the most prominent civil rights groups in the United States, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.), has taken a stand against racism within the Tea Party movement by passing a resolution calling for the weeding out of "racist elements." Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., emphasized that the resolution was not a blanket accusation of the entire Tea Party but a demand for increased responsibility and action against known hate groups. He highlighted the consequences of silence, stating that inaction can lead to violence. The resolution has sparked a backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, who deny any presence of racism within their movement. This issue gained prominence after allegations of racism were made by black members of Congress, who reported being subjected to racial epithets and even spitting during health care legislation protests. The N.A.A.C.P.'s call for action underscores the importance of standing against racism and promoting clear and responsible behavior within political movements.
