Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to summarize the article while preserving those moral terms.

Looking at the article, I see several terms that carry moral weight. Words like "racist," "hate groups," "bigots," "violence," "silence," "responsibility," "partisan," "attack dog," "racism," and "spitting" stand out. These words are used to convey judgment or moral evaluation, so I'll list them under STEP 1.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The user wants the summary to include as many of these moral terms as possible. I should ensure that the summary captures the main points: the NAACP's resolution, the reaction from Tea Party groups, and the context of racism allegations. I'll structure the summary to include the key players, their actions, and the moral framing without exceeding 200 words.

I should start by stating the NAACP's action, then mention Jealous's clarification, the resolution's call for responsibility, the consequences of silence, and the Tea Party's response. Including Palin's defense and the St. Louis Tea Party's resolution adds depth. Finally, I'll note the ongoing allegations and the Tea Party's denial of racism. I'll make sure to use the identified moral terms where appropriate to preserve the author's framing.

I need to be careful to keep the summary clear and within the word limit. Also, I should maintain a neutral tone while including the moral language. Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all essential points.

**STEP 1:**  
* racist  
* hate groups  
* bigots  
* violence  
* silence  
* responsibility  
* partisan  
* attack dog  
* racism  
* spitting  

**SUMMARY:**  
The NAACP passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to purge "racist elements" from their ranks, citing the need for them to distance themselves from hate groups. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the resolution was not to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist but to hold them accountable for their associations. He stressed that increased public attention and power require responsibility, stating that silence could lead to violence. Tea Party groups and supporters strongly opposed the resolution, with Sarah Palin urging the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition accused the NAACP of acting as a "partisan political attack dog" and called for an IRS review of its tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced allegations of racism, including instances of racial epithets and spitting, though they deny any racism within their ranks. END OF SUMMARY.
