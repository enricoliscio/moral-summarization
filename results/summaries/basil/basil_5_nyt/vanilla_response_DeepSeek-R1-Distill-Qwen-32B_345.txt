Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution regarding the Tea Party groups. They want the Tea Party to remove racist elements. The NAACP's president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, clarifies that they're not labeling the entire Tea Party as racist, but they need to distance themselves from hate groups. He mentions that with more attention and power, the Tea Party should act responsibly. He also says that silence can lead to violence, so they need to stand up against bigots.

On the flip side, the Tea Party isn't happy. Sarah Palin defended them, calling on the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. A Tea Party group in St. Louis even issued their own resolution, accusing the NAACP of being partisan and suggesting an IRS review of their tax status. The Tea Party denies any racism, despite past incidents where protesters used racial slurs and spit at a congressman.

So, the key points are: NAACP's resolution, Jealous's clarification, the Tea Party's response, Palin's involvement, the counter-resolution, and the ongoing allegations of racism in the Tea Party.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, then Jealous's points, followed by the Tea Party's reactions, and end with the context of the allegations.

I should ensure clarity and keep it concise, avoiding unnecessary details. Let me structure it step by step to cover all main points without exceeding the word limit.
