Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP's resolution regarding the Tea Party. Let me read through the article first.

The article says that the NAACP, a major civil rights group, passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove racist elements. They did this at their annual convention in Kansas City. The president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, clarified that they're not labeling the entire Tea Party as racist, but they need to distance themselves from hate groups that encourage members to join. He mentions that with more attention and power, comes responsibility, and silence could lead to violence.

The Tea Party response was negative. Sarah Palin defended the movement, asking the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. Another Tea Party group accused the NAACP of being a partisan tool and suggested reviewing their tax status. The article also mentions past allegations of racism against the Tea Party, including racial slurs and spitting incidents during protests.

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: NAACP's resolution, Jealous's stance, Tea Party's reactions, and the context of past racism allegations. I should keep it under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by first stating the resolution, then Jealous's comments, followed by the Tea Party's responses, and mention the historical context of racism allegations. Make sure it's concise and covers all key elements without getting too detailed.
