SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the oldest and largest civil rights groups in the US, passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but to encourage them to distance themselves from known hate groups. NAACP president Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the need for the Tea Party to act responsibly and make it clear that there is no place for bigotry within the movement. The resolution sparked backlash from Tea Party groups and their supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition even issued a resolution against the NAACP, accusing them of partisanship and calling for a review of their tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced persistent allegations of racism, particularly after incidents involving black members of Congress during the healthcare legislation vote. Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within the movement.
END OF SUMMARY.
