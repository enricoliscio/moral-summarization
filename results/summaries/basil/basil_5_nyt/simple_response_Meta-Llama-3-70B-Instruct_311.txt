SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that this is not a blanket accusation of racism against the entire Tea Party movement, but rather a demand for accountability to distance themselves from known hate groups that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. Jealous argued that with increased power comes the responsibility to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. The resolution has been met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog." The Tea Party has faced allegations of racism since protests against healthcare legislation, which they deny. The NAACP's resolution is a moral imperative to stand against racism and hate groups.
