Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article about the NAACP calling out the Tea Party for racism. They also listed specific morally framed words that I need to include in the summary.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The NAACP passed a resolution urging the Tea Party to remove racist elements. They don't want to label the entire movement as racist but point out that they should distance themselves from hate groups. The president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasizes responsibility and the consequence of silence leading to violence. The Tea Party and supporters like Sarah Palin are reacting negatively, accusing the NAACP of partisanship and even suggesting a tax review. There are allegations of racism within the Tea Party, including racial slurs and spitting.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing intact. I should use the listed words: responsibly, violence, stand, clear, acting, review, racism, hurling, spitting. I'll structure the summary to include these words where appropriate.

I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, then mention the president's points about responsibility and violence. Then, I'll note the Tea Party's reaction and the accusations of racism. I'll make sure to include all the key points concisely, under 200 words.

I should also ensure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has called on Tea Party groups to "weed out racist elements" from their ranks, emphasizing the need for them to act responsibly and distance themselves from hate groups. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stressed that silence in the face of bigotry could lead to violence, urging the Tea Party to "stand up and say enough is enough." The resolution, passed at the NAACP's annual convention, does not label the entire Tea Party movement as racist but highlights the responsibility that comes with increased public attention and power. Tea Party groups and their supporters, including Sarah Palin, have strongly opposed the resolution, accusing the NAACP of acting as a "partisan political attack dog" and calling for a review of its tax-exempt status. The Tea Party has been accused of racism, with allegations of members hurling racial epithets and spitting on black members of Congress during protests. Tea Party leaders, however, deny any racism within their movement. END OF SUMMARY.
