SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as "racist", but rather to urge them to distance themselves from known "hate groups" that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. Jealous stressed that with increased power comes the "responsibility to act responsibly" and to stand up against "bigots" and "racism". The resolution has been met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the Tea Party movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog". The NAACP's move comes amidst allegations of "racism" within the Tea Party movement, which its groups deny. The organization is urging the Tea Party to take a stand against "silence" and "violence" and to make it clear that there is no place for "bigots" in their movement.
