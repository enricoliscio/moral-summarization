SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for Tea Party groups to expel "racist elements" from their ranks. The resolution was not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but to encourage them to distance themselves from known hate groups. NAACP president Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the responsibility of the Tea Party movement to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. The resolution faced criticism from Tea Party groups and their supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and called for the Obamas to rebuke the NAACP. The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued a counter-resolution, accusing the NAACP of partisanship and requesting a review of their tax-exempt status. The Tea Party movement has faced persistent allegations of racism, particularly during protests against health care legislation when black members of Congress reported racial epithets and physical assaults. Tea Party groups deny the presence of racism within the movement.
END OF SUMMARY.
