SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to "weed out" racist elements from their ranks. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that the resolution is not meant to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist, but rather to urge them to take responsibility and distance themselves from known hate groups. He stressed that with increased power comes the responsibility to act responsibly, and that silence can lead to violence. The resolution has been met with resistance from Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, who defended the movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog". The NAACP's move comes amidst allegations of racism within the Tea Party, including reports of racial epithets and spitting on a congressman. The NAACP is calling on the Tea Party to stand up and make it clear that there is no place for bigots in their movement.
