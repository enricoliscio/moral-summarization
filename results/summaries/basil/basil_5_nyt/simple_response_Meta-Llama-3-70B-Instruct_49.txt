SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution calling on Tea Party groups to remove "racist elements" from their ranks. The NAACP president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that this is not a blanket accusation of racism against the entire Tea Party movement, but rather a call to action to distance themselves from known hate groups that encourage their members to join the Tea Party. The resolution comes amidst allegations of racism within the Tea Party movement, including reports of racial epithets and spitting on a congressman. The NAACP argues that with increased power and public attention comes the responsibility to act responsibly and condemn bigotry. In response, Tea Party groups and supporters, including Sarah Palin, have defended the movement and accused the NAACP of being a "partisan political attack dog."
