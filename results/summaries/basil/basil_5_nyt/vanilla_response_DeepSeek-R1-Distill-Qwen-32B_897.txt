Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the NAACP passing a resolution regarding the Tea Party. They want the Tea Party to remove racist elements. The NAACP's president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, clarifies that they're not labeling the entire Tea Party as racist, but they need to distance themselves from hate groups. He mentions that with more attention and power comes responsibility, and silence can lead to violence.

On the other side, Tea Party supporters like Sarah Palin are defending the movement. They're accusing the NAACP of being partisan and even suggesting a review of their tax-exempt status. There's a history of racism allegations against the Tea Party, like protesters using racial slurs and spitting on a congressman. The Tea Party denies any racism within their ranks.

So, the key points are: NAACP's resolution, Jealous's clarification, the reaction from Tea Party supporters, the history of racism allegations, and the Tea Party's denial. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include all main points concisely. Maybe start with the NAACP's action, then Jealous's statements, followed by the reactions and the context of the allegations. Keep it clear and straightforward without getting too detailed.
