SUMMARY: In a recent Facebook post, Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, criticized her sister, Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. She disagreed with Elizabeth Cheney's position that the matter of same-sex marriage should be left to the states and the people to decide. Mary Cheney's post reflected her belief in the inherent equality of all families and their entitlement to the same opportunities. Former Vice President Cheney has publicly voiced his support for same-sex marriage, aligning with his daughter Mary's perspective while still advocating for state-level decision-making. This intra-family dispute highlights the ongoing debate surrounding same-sex marriage and the differing perspectives within the Republican Party.
