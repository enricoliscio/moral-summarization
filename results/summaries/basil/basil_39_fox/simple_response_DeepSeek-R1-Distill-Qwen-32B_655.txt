Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters and their differing views on same-sex marriage. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney, the daughter of Dick Cheney, is openly lesbian and married. She's criticizing her sister Elizabeth, who is running for the Wyoming Senate. Elizabeth's stance is that same-sex marriage should be decided by each state, not by judges or legislators. Mary, on the other hand, believes it's a matter of freedom and equal rights for all families, regardless of how they're formed.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect, so highlighting their differing views on equality and state rights is important. Also, noting that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage but agrees with Elizabeth on the state-level decision is a key point. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I'll start by introducing the sisters and their conflict. Then, outline each sister's position, including Mary's emphasis on equality and Elizabeth's stance on state decisions. I'll also mention Dick Cheney's support but his agreement on the state-level approach. Finally, I'll note the upcoming election in 2014.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary straightforward, making sure it's clear and captures the moral debate between the sisters. Let me piece this together step by step to ensure all important points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth, a Republican Senate candidate in Wyoming, over their differing views on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, condemned Elizabeth's stance, arguing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights. Elizabeth, however, has maintained that the issue should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis, not by judges or legislators. Mary sharply disagreed, stating that such decisions should not be left to a "show of hands." The sisters' conflict highlights a moral divide within their family, as their father, Dick Cheney, has also supported same-sex marriage but agreed with Elizabeth's stance on state-level decision-making. The debate underscores the ongoing tension between individual rights and state sovereignty in the context of same-sex marriage. Elizabeth is running against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary. END OF SUMMARY.
