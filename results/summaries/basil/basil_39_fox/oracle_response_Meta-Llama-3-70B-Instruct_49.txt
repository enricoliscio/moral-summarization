SUMMARY:

In a public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, took to Facebook to express her love for her sister, Elizabeth, while strongly disagreeing with her stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve the same rights and protections. She urged her followers to "like and share" if they agree with her. Notably, their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and also believes the issue should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The disagreement highlights the complex and often personal nature of the debate around same-sex marriage.
