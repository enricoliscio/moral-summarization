SUMMARY:
In a rare public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, blasted her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, on Facebook over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." She deemed her sister's stance "dead wrong," saying it's not something to be decided by a show of hands. Elizabeth Cheney believes the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage, mirroring Elizabeth's stance. The debate has sparked a moral discussion on the importance of freedom, rights, and protections for all families. END OF SUMMARY.
