SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted her older sister, Wyoming Senate candidate Elizabeth Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney took to Facebook to express her disagreement with her sister's position, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that "all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Elizabeth Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary, has articulated her belief that the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. She stated, "I am not pro-gay marriage." Mary Cheney responded, arguing that the issue is not something to be decided by a show of hands. The sisters' public disagreement highlights the differing views within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President himself having voiced support for same-sex marriage while also supporting state-by-state decision-making. Elizabeth Cheney's declaration to challenge the incumbent senator and her stance on same-sex marriage have sparked an internecine conflict within the family, with Mary Cheney taking a public stand for equal rights.
