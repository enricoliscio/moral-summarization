Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters and their differing views on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article is about Mary Cheney, who is one of Dick Cheney's daughters, criticizing her sister Elizabeth on Facebook. Mary is openly lesbian and married, so she's taking a strong stance on the issue. She says that all families should have the same rights, regardless of how they're made, which I think means she supports same-sex marriage. 

On the other hand, Elizabeth Cheney, who's running for the Senate in Wyoming, says she's not pro-gay marriage and believes it should be decided by the states, not judges or legislators. That's interesting because Dick Cheney, their father, has also supported same-sex marriage but agrees with the state-by-state approach.

Mary's response was pretty direct, saying it's not a matter for a show of hands and asking people to like and share her post if they agree. Elizabeth is challenging Mike Enzi in the Republican primary for the Senate, and the election is in 2014.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely. I should mention the sisters' names, their positions, their stances on same-sex marriage, and the family context with their father's support. Also, note the upcoming election.

Let me structure it: start with the conflict between Mary and Elizabeth Cheney, their positions, the family's stance, and the political implications. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details and focus on the main conflict and their arguments. Make sure to include that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage but also takes the state-by-state approach, which is similar to Elizabeth's stance but different from Mary's.

Also, mention that the election is in 2014 and that Elizabeth is challenging a Republican incumbent. That adds context about why this is a significant issue for her campaign.

Alright, putting it all together, making sure each sentence flows and covers all the necessary points without being too wordy.
