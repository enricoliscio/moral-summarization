SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted her sister, Wyoming Senate candidate Elizabeth Cheney, for her opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney took to Facebook to express her stance, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that "all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." She criticized her sister's position that the matter should be decided by the states and the people, arguing that it is not something to be put to a vote. Elizabeth Cheney, who has declared her intention to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary, reportedly opposes same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided by the states and not by judges or legislators. Meanwhile, their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage, mirroring his daughter Elizabeth's stance that it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. Mary Cheney's public statement highlights a family divide over same-sex marriage, with her taking a firm moral stand against her sister's position.
