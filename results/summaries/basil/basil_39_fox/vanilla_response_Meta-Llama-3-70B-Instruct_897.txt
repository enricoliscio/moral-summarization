SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth Cheney believes the issue should be decided by the states and their voters, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married, responded on Facebook, saying that freedom means freedom for everyone, and all families deserve the same rights and protections. She disagreed with her sister's stance, saying it's not something to be decided by a show of hands. The public disagreement is notable, as their father, Dick Cheney, has also voiced support for same-sex marriage and believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The controversy comes as Elizabeth Cheney prepares to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary.
