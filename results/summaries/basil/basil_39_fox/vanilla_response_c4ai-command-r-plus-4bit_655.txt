SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her sister, Liz Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Liz Cheney, a Republican candidate for the Wyoming Senate, has stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. In response, Mary Cheney posted on Facebook that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their makeup, should be entitled to the same rights and protections. She also disagreed with her sister's belief that the issue should be put to a vote, stating that it is not something to be decided by a show of hands. The public disagreement between the sisters highlights the differing views within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President himself having voiced support for same-sex marriage while also believing it should be decided on a state-by-state basis.
END OF SUMMARY.
