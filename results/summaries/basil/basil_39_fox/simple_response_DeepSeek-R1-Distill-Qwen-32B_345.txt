Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Elizabeth over their differing views on same-sex marriage. Mary is openly lesbian and supports same-sex marriage, while Elizabeth, who's running for the Senate, believes it should be decided by the states. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage but also thinks it's a state issue.

I should make sure the summary captures the conflict between the sisters, their stances, and the moral implications. The moral framing is important here, so I need to highlight how Mary argues for equality and freedom, while Elizabeth's stance is more about states' rights. Also, mentioning their father's support adds context about the family's perspective.

I'll structure the summary to include both sisters' positions, the family dynamic, and the broader moral debate. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft it out: Start with the sisters' conflict, their positions, the moral arguments, and their father's stance. Make sure to keep the language clear and preserve the moral elements each side presents.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a concise summary.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth, a Republican Senate candidate in Wyoming, over their differing views on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, posted on Facebook, stating that all families deserve equal rights and that freedom means inclusion for everyone. She directly opposed Elizabeth's stance, which favors letting states decide the issue rather than federal judges or legislators. Elizabeth, who declared her candidacy in July, has argued that same-sex marriage should not be a federal matter but a decision left to the states and their voters. Mary countered, asserting that the issue is not a matter for public vote but a question of equality. Dick Cheney, their father, has publicly supported same-sex marriage while also advocating for a state-by-state approach, mirroring Elizabeth's stance. The sisters' conflict highlights a moral divide over equality versus states' rights in the debate over marriage equality. END OF SUMMARY.
