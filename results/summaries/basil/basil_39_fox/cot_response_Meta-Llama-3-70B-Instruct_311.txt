SUMMARY:
In a rare public disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted her sister Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, on Facebook for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." She countered Elizabeth's view that same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, saying it's not something to be decided by a "show of hands." Mary Cheney's post was a passionate defense of her own marriage and family, emphasizing that all families deserve the same "rights, privileges and protections." The disagreement highlights the complexity of the issue, with even family members holding differing views. END OF SUMMARY.
