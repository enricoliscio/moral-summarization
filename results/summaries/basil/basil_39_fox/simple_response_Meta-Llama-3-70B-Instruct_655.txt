SUMMARY:

In a rare public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her sister Elizabeth's stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, believes that same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary, who has been married to her wife Heather Poe since 2012, passionately disagreed, arguing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Mary's post was a heartfelt plea for equality, urging her followers to "like and share" if they agree. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of standing up for what is right, even if it means disagreeing with those closest to us. It also underscores the significance of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

END OF SUMMARY.
