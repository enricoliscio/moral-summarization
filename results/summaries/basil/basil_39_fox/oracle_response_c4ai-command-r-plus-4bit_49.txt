SUMMARY: In a recent Facebook post, Mary Cheney, the lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted her sister, Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, for her opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators. This disagreement highlights a divide within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President publicly supporting same-sex marriage while his daughter runs on an anti-LGBT platform. Mary Cheney's public stance against her sister's views showcases her love and support for the LGBT community, demonstrating her belief in the importance of equal rights for all families.
