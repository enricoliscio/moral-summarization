SUMMARY:
In a recent Facebook post, Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted her older sister, Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of their makeup, are entitled to the same rights and protections. She opposed her sister's position that the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Elizabeth Cheney's stance sparked controversy as she stated she is "not pro-gay marriage." Meanwhile, their father, former Vice President Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage, echoing Elizabeth's belief that the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The intra-family dispute highlights the ongoing debate surrounding same-sex marriage and the differing views on how the issue should be addressed. Mary Cheney's stance underscores the importance of equality and freedom for all families, while Elizabeth Cheney's position reflects a more conservative approach that emphasizes state and popular sovereignty. The Cheney sisters' disagreement showcases a divide in both personal and political beliefs, demonstrating that even within families, views on social issues can vary significantly.
