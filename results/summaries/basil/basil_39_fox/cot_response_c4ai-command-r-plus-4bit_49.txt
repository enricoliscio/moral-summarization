SUMMARY: 
In a recent Facebook post, Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted her sister, Wyoming Senate candidate Elizabeth Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their makeup, are entitled to the same rights and protections. She took issue with her sister's belief that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney's post came in response to Elizabeth Cheney's recent statement that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and that the issue should be left to the states and the people to decide. The intra-family dispute highlights a disagreement over the role of government and individual rights, with Mary Cheney advocating for equal rights and protections for all families, and her sister, Elizabeth Cheney, taking a more states' rights approach. The moral framing of the issue, with words like "wrong," "entitled," and "rights," underscores the importance of fairness and equality in the debate over same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
