Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters and their differing views on same-sex marriage. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

Mary Cheney is the openly lesbian daughter of Dick Cheney and is married to Heather Poe. She's on Facebook criticizing her sister Elizabeth, who is running for the Wyoming Senate. Mary is upset because Elizabeth doesn't support same-sex marriage and thinks it should be decided by each state. Mary argues that freedom means equal rights for everyone, regardless of their family structure. She's pretty direct in her criticism, even asking people to like and share her post.

On the other hand, Elizabeth Cheney says she's not pro-gay marriage and believes it's up to the states and their people to decide, not judges or legislators. She's running against Mike Enzi, a Republican, in the primary for 2014. Their dad, Dick Cheney, has also supported same-sex marriage but shares Elizabeth's stance on it being a state issue.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: who Mary and Elizabeth are, their positions on same-sex marriage, their family relationship, and Dick Cheney's stance. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight the tension between individual rights and state-level decisions.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with Mary's criticism, then Elizabeth's stance, and then mention Dick Cheney's support and stance. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure it's in the third person and objective, but includes the moral aspects each sister represents.

Let me draft that. Start with Mary's criticism, her support for equality, then Elizabeth's stance on states' rights, and the family context. Also, mention Dick Cheney's position to show the family's divided views on the issue. Keep it all within the word limit, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is evident.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, posted on Facebook that all families deserve equal rights, regardless of their composition. She blasted Elizabeth for opposing same-sex marriage and arguing that the issue should be decided by states rather than judges or legislators. Elizabeth, who is running as a Republican in Wyoming's 2014 primary, has stated she is not "pro-gay marriage" and believes it should be a matter for state voters. Mary countered, asserting that such decisions should not be left to a "show of hands." Dick Cheney, their father, has supported same-sex marriage but has also advocated for a state-by-state approach. The sisters' differing views highlight a family divide over LGBTQ+ rights and the role of states versus individual freedoms. END OF SUMMARY.
