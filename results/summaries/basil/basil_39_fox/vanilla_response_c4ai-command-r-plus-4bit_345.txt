SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her older sister, Liz Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, expressed her disagreement with Liz's position that same-sex marriage should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis. Mary asserted that freedom means equality for all families, regardless of their makeup. She argued that it should not be a matter decided by a show of hands. Liz Cheney, a Republican candidate for the Wyoming Senate, first articulated her position on Friday, stating that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be left to the states and their people to decide. The former Vice President has publicly supported same-sex marriage but agrees with Liz that it should be a state decision. The sisters' disagreement highlights a divide within the Cheney family on the issue of same-sex marriage rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
