SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth Cheney believes that same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who has been married to her wife since 2012, responded on Facebook, saying that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. She argued that the issue should not be decided by a "show of hands," implying that it is a fundamental right that should be protected. The public disagreement between the two sisters is notable, especially given that their father, Dick Cheney, has also expressed support for same-sex marriage.

END OF SUMMARY.
