SUMMARY:
In a rare public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, blasted her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, on Facebook over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is married to Heather Poe, argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." She labeled her sister's view as "dead wrong," saying that the issue of marriage should not be decided by a "show of hands." Elizabeth Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and agrees with Elizabeth's stance. The disagreement has sparked a heated debate on the moral implications of same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
