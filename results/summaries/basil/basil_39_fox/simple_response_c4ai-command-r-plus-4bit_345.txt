SUMMARY: A moral clash between two sisters, Mary and Elizabeth Cheney, has surfaced over Facebook regarding their opposing views on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married to her wife, Heather Poe, since 2012, took to Facebook to criticize her older sister, Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance against same-sex marriage. Mary firmly stated that freedom entails equality for all families, regardless of their composition. She argued that same-sex couples deserve the same rights, privileges, and protections as heterosexual couples. On the other hand, Elizabeth Cheney, mirroring their father's stance, believes the matter should be left to the states and decided by the people, not judges or legislators. She stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage." Mary Cheney strongly disagreed, asserting that the matter is about fundamental rights and should not be left to a majority vote. The moral debate between the two sisters has sparked attention, with Mary advocating for equal rights and freedom for all, while Elizabeth upholds a more conservative view, prioritizing state-level decision-making.

END OF SUMMARY.
