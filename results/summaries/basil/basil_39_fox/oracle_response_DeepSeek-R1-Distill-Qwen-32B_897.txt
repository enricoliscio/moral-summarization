Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally framed words like "love" and "support." 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Elizabeth over same-sex marriage. Mary is openly lesbian and married, so her stance is personal. She uses strong language on Facebook, calling her sister "dead wrong" and emphasizing love and freedom for all families. 

Elizabeth, on the other hand, takes a more cautious approach, saying it's up to the states. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage but also thinks it's a state issue. 

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "love" and "support." I'll structure it to highlight Mary's passionate stance and Elizabeth's stance, then mention Dick's support. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure it's concise but covers all key points.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her older sister Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, posted on Facebook, "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone." She argued that all families, regardless of how they are made, deserve equal rights and protections. Elizabeth, however, has stated that the issue of marriage should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators. Mary sharply disagreed, writing, "It’s not something to be decided by a show of hands." Elizabeth is running in the Republican primary against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, with the election set for 2014. Their father, Dick Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage but echoed Elizabeth’s view that the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis. END OF SUMMARY.
