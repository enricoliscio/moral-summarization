SUMMARY:

In a rare display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is openly lesbian and married, took to Facebook to express her disagreement, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Elizabeth, on the other hand, believes that same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary argued that this is not a matter to be decided by a "show of hands," implying that her sister's stance is unjust and discriminatory. The disagreement highlights the complexities of family dynamics and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, even when they differ from those of loved ones.

END OF SUMMARY.
