Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters' disagreement on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article again to get all the details.

So, Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married, is criticizing her sister Elizabeth on Facebook. Elizabeth is running for the Wyoming Senate and has taken a stance that same-sex marriage should be decided by the states, not judges or legislators. Mary is opposing this, saying it's a matter of freedom for everyone and shouldn't be left to a vote.

I should note the key points: Mary's support for same-sex marriage, Elizabeth's stance on state-level decisions, their family ties, and their father's similar position. Also, the article mentions the upcoming primary election in 2014.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of their disagreement. I'll structure it to mention both sisters, their positions, and the context of their political and personal relationship. 

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I'll start with the main conflict, then explain each sister's position, and wrap up with the political context and their father's stance. That should cover all necessary points without being too lengthy.
