SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth Cheney believes that the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney responded on Facebook, saying that her sister is "dead wrong" and that "freedom means freedom for everyone," including the right to marry regardless of sexual orientation. Mary Cheney also encouraged her Facebook friends to "like and share" if they agree with her. The public disagreement comes as Elizabeth Cheney prepares to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary in 2014. Notably, their father, Dick Cheney, has also expressed support for same-sex marriage and believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis.

END OF SUMMARY.
