Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used words like "love" and "support," so I should make sure those are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Mary Cheney is criticizing her sister Elizabeth over same-sex marriage. Mary is openly lesbian and supports equal rights, while Elizabeth wants states to decide. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage but also favors state-level decisions.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Mary's use of "love" for her sister despite disagreement is key. Also, both sisters' stances on support for marriage equality or state decisions are important.

I should structure the summary to show the family conflict, their positions, and the moral language used. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure to include "love" and "support" where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary flows well.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, posted on Facebook, expressing her "love" for her sister while stating that Elizabeth is "dead wrong" on the issue. She argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone," emphasizing that all families deserve equal rights. Elizabeth, however, believes the issue should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators, and has declared she is "not pro-gay marriage." Mary countered, asserting that the matter should not be subject to a "show of hands." The sisters' disagreement highlights a family divide on the issue, with their father, Dick Cheney, also supporting same-sex marriage but agreeing that it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. END OF SUMMARY.
