Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Elizabeth over same-sex marriage. The author used words like "love" and "support," so I need to keep those in the summary.

First, I'll read the article to understand the key points. Mary Cheney is openly lesbian and married, so her stance is clear. She's criticizing Elizabeth, who is running for Senate, for opposing same-sex marriage. Elizabeth thinks it should be decided by states, not judges or legislators. Mary argues that it's not a matter for popular vote.

I need to include the moral words. So, Mary "loves" her sister but disagrees. Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage, mirroring Elizabeth's stance on state decisions. I should mention that both Cheney sisters have different views despite their father's support.

I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. Make sure to highlight the moral terms and the conflict between the sisters. Also, note the election timeline and the broader context of family support versus policy differences.

Alright, putting it all together now.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over Elizabeth's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, expressed her love for her sister but strongly disagreed with Elizabeth's position, arguing that all families deserve equal rights regardless of their composition. Elizabeth, who opposes same-sex marriage, believes the issue should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis, not by judges or legislators. Mary countered, stating that the matter should not be subject to a popular vote. Dick Cheney, their father, has publicly supported same-sex marriage while echoing Elizabeth's belief that the issue should be decided at the state level. The sisters' disagreement highlights a divide within their family, even as they share a commitment to certain principles. The election, in which Elizabeth is challenging incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, is set for 2014. END OF SUMMARY.
