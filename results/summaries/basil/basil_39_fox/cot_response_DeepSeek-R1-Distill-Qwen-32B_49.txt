Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Elizabeth over same-sex marriage. Mary is openly lesbian and married, so her stance is clear. She's on Facebook saying that all families should have equal rights. On the other hand, Elizabeth, who's running for Senate, believes it's up to the states to decide, not judges or legislators. She's against gay marriage. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage but also thinks it's a state issue.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again. Words like "blast," "dead wrong," "freedom," "rights," "pro-gay marriage," "show of hands," "support," "oppose." These terms carry moral weight because they express strong opinions and values.

Now, for the summary, I have to keep it under 200 words and include as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll start by introducing the sisters and their conflict. Mention Mary's support for same-sex marriage and her criticism of Elizabeth. Then, explain Elizabeth's stance and the state-by-state approach. Also, include Dick Cheney's support but his similar stance on state decisions. Conclude with the implications for the election and the family's reputation.

I should make sure the summary flows well and captures the moral debate without being too detailed. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included and the moral framing is preserved.

Mary supports equal rights for all families, including same-sex couples, while Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, believes the issue should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis, not by judges or legislators. Mary called her sister's position "dead wrong," emphasizing that freedom means rights for everyone. Elizabeth has declared her opposition to same-sex marriage, arguing it should be a matter of popular vote. Dick Cheney, though supporting same-sex marriage, has also advocated for state-level decisions. The sisters' debate highlights the ongoing moral and political divide over this issue, with implications for the 2014 Republican primary election.
