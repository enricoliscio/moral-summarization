SUMMARY: A public moral dispute has arisen between Mary Cheney, the lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, and her older sister, Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, regarding same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney took to Facebook to express her support for same-sex marriage and criticize her sister's stance. She asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the people in each state rather than by judges or legislators. She stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage." The dispute highlights the differing views on same-sex marriage within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President himself supporting same-sex marriage but agreeing with Elizabeth that it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. Mary Cheney's public stance showcases her love and support for her own family and her belief in equal rights for all.
END OF SUMMARY.
