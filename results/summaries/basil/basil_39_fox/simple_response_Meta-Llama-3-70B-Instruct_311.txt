SUMMARY:

In a rare public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has taken to Facebook to criticize her sister Elizabeth's stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, believes the issue should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis, whereas Mary, an openly lesbian woman, argues that all families deserve equal rights and protections regardless of their composition. Mary's post emphasizes that freedom means freedom for everyone, and that the issue should not be decided by a "show of hands.‚Äù The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of upholding equality and human rights, even within one's own family. It also underscores the need for elected officials to take a stand on issues of social justice, rather than deferring to popular opinion.
