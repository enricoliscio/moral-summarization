Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Elizabeth over same-sex marriage. Mary is openly lesbian and married, while Elizabeth is running for Senate and has a different stance.

First, I should identify the key points. Mary is blasting Elizabeth on Facebook. She supports same-sex marriage rights, while Elizabeth believes it's a state decision. The article mentions their father, Dick Cheney, also supports same-sex marriage but shares Elizabeth's view on state-level decisions.

I need to make sure the summary includes who the sisters are, their positions, and the context of Elizabeth's Senate campaign. Also, note that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage but agrees with state-level decisions.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the conflict between the sisters, their stances, mention the family support, and the election context.

I should avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main points. Make sure to include that Mary is married to Heather Poe and the year of the election, 2014.

Let me draft it: Mary Cheney criticizes her sister Elizabeth for opposing same-sex marriage, stating it's a fundamental right. Elizabeth believes it's a state issue. Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage but also thinks states should decide. The summary should capture the family's divided stance and the political implications.

I think that's all the essential info. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.
