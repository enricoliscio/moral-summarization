SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married, posted on Facebook that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney had stated that same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney responded that the issue should not be decided by a "show of hands" and encouraged her followers to like and share her post if they agree. The disagreement has sparked a public debate within the Cheney family, with former Vice President Dick Cheney having previously voiced support for same-sex marriage and also advocating for a state-by-state approach.
