SUMMARY:

In a rare display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Elizabeth Cheney believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators, and has stated she is not pro-gay marriage. Mary Cheney countered on Facebook, arguing that freedom means equal rights for all families, regardless of their composition. She emphasized that the issue shouldn't be decided by a show of hands, implying that it's a matter of fundamental human rights, not a popularity contest. The disagreement is particularly noteworthy given their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage and also believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of standing up for equal rights and challenging discriminatory views, even within one's own family.
