SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her sister, Liz Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, posted that she loves her sister but disagrees with her position, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families should have the same rights and protections. Liz Cheney, a Republican candidate for the Wyoming Senate, had previously stated that she believes the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and not by judges or legislators. She clarified that she is "not pro-gay marriage." In response, Mary Cheney countered that the matter should not be decided by a show of hands. The exchange highlights a divide within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President himself publicly supporting same-sex marriage while also believing it should be a state-level decision. The sisters' disagreement has attracted attention due to their differing public stances and the political implications of Liz Cheney's Senate bid.
END OF SUMMARY.
