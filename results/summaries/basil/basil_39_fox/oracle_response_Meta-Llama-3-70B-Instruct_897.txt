SUMMARY:

In a rare display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe, took to Facebook to criticize her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney expressed her love for her sister while strongly disagreeing with her position, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney had said that same-sex marriage should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that it's not a matter to be decided by a "show of hands." Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage, also advocating for a state-by-state decision. The family's differing views on the issue have sparked a heated debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
