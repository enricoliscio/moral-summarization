Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters and their differing views on same-sex marriage. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

Mary Cheney is openly lesbian and married, and she's criticizing her sister Elizabeth, who is running for the Senate. Mary is upset because Elizabeth doesn't support same-sex marriage and thinks it should be decided by the states. Mary argues that freedom means equal rights for everyone, regardless of their family structure. She's using Facebook to voice her disagreement, asking people to like and share her post.

On the other hand, Elizabeth Cheney is taking a stance that it's up to the states to decide, not judges or legislators. She's against same-sex marriage, which contrasts with her father, Dick Cheney, who supports it and also believes it's a state issue. The article mentions that Elizabeth is challenging Mike Enzi in the Republican primary for the Senate in 2014.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral conflict here. Mary is emphasizing equality and the rights of all families, while Elizabeth is arguing for state-level decision-making, which Mary sees as problematic. The father's stance is similar to Elizabeth's but supports same-sex marriage, adding another layer to the family's internal debate.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main points: who the sisters are, their opposing views, the platforms they're using, and the context of the election. Also, highlighting the moral aspect of equal rights versus state decision-making is crucial.

Let me structure this: start with the sisters' names and their positions, then outline their opposing views, mention the father's stance, and end with the election context. Make sure it flows naturally and stays within the word limit.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary, making sure to preserve the moral framing by emphasizing the clash between equal rights and state-level decision-making.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth, a Republican Senate candidate in Wyoming, for opposing same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, posted on Facebook that all families deserve equal rights and protections, regardless of their makeup. Elizabeth, however, argues that the issue of marriage should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators. She explicitly stated she is not "pro-gay marriage," a stance that contrasts with her sister's advocacy for equality. Dick Cheney, meanwhile, has supported same-sex marriage but also believes the issue should be decided on a state-by-state basis. Elizabeth is running in the 2014 Republican primary against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi. The sisters' differing views highlight a family divide over the moral and legal implications of same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
