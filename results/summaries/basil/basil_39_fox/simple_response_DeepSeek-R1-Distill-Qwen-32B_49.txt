Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Mary Cheney, the daughter of Dick Cheney, is criticizing her sister Elizabeth on Facebook because of Elizabeth's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is openly lesbian and married, so she's taking a strong position here. She argues that everyone should have the same rights, regardless of their family structure. 

Elizabeth, on the other hand, is running for the Senate in Wyoming and says she's not pro-gay marriage. She believes the issue should be decided by each state's voters, not judges or legislators. That's interesting because Dick Cheney, their father, supports same-sex marriage but also thinks it's a state issue.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect. Mary is emphasizing equality and freedom for all families, while Elizabeth is about states' rights. The father's stance adds another layer, showing a family divide on the issue.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the sisters, their positions, and the context of their father's support. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's clear and concise. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft that. Make sure to include the key points: Mary's criticism, her support for equality, Elizabeth's stance on state decisions, and Dick Cheney's position. Also, note that Elizabeth is running for Senate and the election is in 2014.

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary, ensuring the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth on Facebook for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, argued that all families deserve equal rights, regardless of their composition, while Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, stated she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis. Mary emphasized that freedom means rights for everyone, while Elizabeth advocated for states' rights over the matter. Dick Cheney has also supported same-sex marriage but echoed Elizabeth's belief in state-level decisions. The sisters' differing views highlight a family divide on the issue as Elizabeth prepares to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary. END OF SUMMARY.
