SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has taken to Facebook to criticize her sister, Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, for her opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney posted a message on her personal Facebook page expressing her disagreement with her sister's stance, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their makeup, should be entitled to the same rights and protections. Liz Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary, has articulated her position that the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and "by the people themselves." In response, Mary Cheney countered that the matter is not something to be decided by a show of hands. The public disagreement between the two sisters has brought attention to the differing views within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President himself having previously expressed support for same-sex marriage while also stating that it should be decided on a state-by-state basis.
END OF SUMMARY.
