SUMMARY: A public Facebook clash between sisters Mary and Elizabeth Cheney has brought to light the moral question of same-sex marriage rights in the United States. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married to her wife Heather Poe, criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance against same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney asserted that freedom means equality for all families, regardless of their makeup, and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney, on the other hand, stated that the issue of marriage should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators. This stance was met with strong opposition from her sister, who argued that equal rights should not be left to a majority vote. The debate highlights the moral dilemma between individual freedom and equal rights for all versus the belief that the majority should decide on moral issues that affect minorities. The clash also brings to light the differing views within the Republican Party, with Mary Cheney's wife, Heather Poe, pointing out that the party claims to support freedom and limited government while wanting to dictate people's personal lives. The Cheney sisters' disagreement reflects a larger national debate on the moral and legal status of same-sex marriage.
END OF SUMMARY.
