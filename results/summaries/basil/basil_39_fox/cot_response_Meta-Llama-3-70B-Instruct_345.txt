SUMMARY:
In a rare public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, took to Facebook to blast her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney wrote that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Elizabeth Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that it's not something to be decided by a "show of hands." The sisters' disagreement highlights the complex and contentious nature of the same-sex marriage debate.
