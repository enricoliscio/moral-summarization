SUMMARY:

In a rare display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, has taken to Facebook to criticize her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who has been married to her wife Heather Poe since 2012, expressed her love for her sister while strongly disagreeing with her views. Elizabeth Cheney believes that same-sex marriage should be decided on a state-by-state basis, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that freedom means freedom for everyone, and all families deserve the same rights and protections. She urged her followers to "like and share" if they agree. Interestingly, their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage, mirroring Elizabeth's stance. The family's differing opinions on this controversial issue have sparked a heated debate.
