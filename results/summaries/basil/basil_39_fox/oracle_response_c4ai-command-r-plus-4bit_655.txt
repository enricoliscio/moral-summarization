SUMMARY: Love and support for same-sex marriage is at the heart of a dispute between sisters Mary and Elizabeth Cheney, daughters of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married to her wife, Heather Poe, since 2012, took to Facebook to criticize her older sister, Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on the issue. Mary Cheney asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their form, deserve equal rights and protections. She disagreed with Elizabeth Cheney's position that the matter should be left to voters on a state-by-state basis, arguing that it is not an issue to be decided by a majority rule. The dispute highlights a contrast in views within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President himself having publicly voiced his support for same-sex marriage while also advocating for state-level decision-making on the matter.

END OF SUMMARY.
