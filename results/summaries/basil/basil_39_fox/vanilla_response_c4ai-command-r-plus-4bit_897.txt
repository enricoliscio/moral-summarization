SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her sister, Liz Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, wrote that she loves her sister but disagrees with her position that same-sex marriage should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis. She argued that freedom means equality for all families, regardless of their makeup. Liz Cheney, a Republican candidate for the Wyoming Senate, stated her opposition to same-sex marriage, saying that it should not be decided by judges or legislators but by the people in each state. Mary Cheney countered that it should not be decided by a show of hands. The sisters' public disagreement highlights a divide within the Cheney family, with the former Vice President also supporting same-sex marriage but agreeing with Liz Cheney that it should be decided by the states.
