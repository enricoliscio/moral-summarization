SUMMARY: Former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter Mary Cheney took to Facebook to criticize her older sister, Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is openly lesbian and married to her wife, Heather Poe, since 2012, expressed her support for marriage equality and her disagreement with her sister's position. She stated that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their form, should be entitled to the same rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators. She stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage." The dispute between the sisters highlights their differing views on the matter, with Mary advocating for equal rights and Elizabeth favoring state-level decision-making. Former Vice President Cheney has publicly voiced his support for same-sex marriage as well, mirroring Elizabeth's stance that the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis.
END OF SUMMARY.
