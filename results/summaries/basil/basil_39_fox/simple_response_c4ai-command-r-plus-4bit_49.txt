SUMMARY: A family feud has erupted between the daughters of former Vice President Dick Cheney over the issue of same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married to her wife Heather Poe, took to Facebook to criticize her older sister, Elizabeth Cheney, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. She strongly disagreed with her sister's position that the matter should be left to voters on a state-by-state basis, arguing that it is not an issue to be decided by a majority rule. Elizabeth Cheney, who has announced her plans to challenge Wyoming's incumbent Senator in the 2014 Republican primary, stated her opposition to same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided by "the people themselves." Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage, aligning with Elizabeth's stance that the decision should be made at the state level. This family dispute highlights a larger moral debate on the balance between individual freedom, equality, and the role of democracy in determining the rights of minorities.
END OF SUMMARY.
