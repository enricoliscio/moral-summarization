Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters' disagreement on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney is one of Dick Cheney's daughters and is openly lesbian, married since 2012. She's criticizing her sister Elizabeth, who is running for the Wyoming Senate. Elizabeth's stance is that same-sex marriage should be decided by each state, not by judges or legislators. She's explicitly saying she's not pro-gay marriage.

Mary responded on Facebook, saying that freedom means everyone should have the same rights, regardless of family makeup. She opposes the idea of letting voters decide through a state-by-state approach, calling it a "show of hands" approach. She's asking people to like and share her post.

The article also mentions that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage but shares Elizabeth's view on state-level decisions. Elizabeth is challenging Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, with the election in 2014.

So, the main points are:
- Mary and Elizabeth Cheney's disagreement on same-sex marriage.
- Elizabeth's stance on state-level decisions vs. Mary's support for universal rights.
- Dick Cheney's support for same-sex marriage but agreeing with Elizabeth on state-level decisions.
- Elizabeth's political bid in Wyoming's Senate race.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I should make sure to include both sisters' positions, their relationship, and the political context.

I should start by introducing the sisters and their disagreement. Then explain each sister's stance, mention their father's position, and note Elizabeth's political campaign.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Make sure the summary flows logically, covering all key points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft it:

"Mary Cheney, one of Dick Cheney's daughters, has criticized her sister Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary, who is openly lesbian and married, argues that all families deserve equal rights, while Elizabeth believes the issue should be decided by states, not judges or legislators. Mary opposes a state-by-state approach, stating it shouldn't be a matter of public vote. Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage but agrees with Elizabeth on state-level decisions. Elizabeth is challenging Senator Mike Enzi in the 2014 Republican primary."

That's concise, covers all points, and is under 200 words. I think this effectively summarizes the article.
