SUMMARY:

In a rare display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, has publicly criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney took to Facebook to express her disagreement, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that it's not something to be decided by a "show of hands." The disagreement is particularly notable given that their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and also believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of standing up for what is right, even if it means disagreeing with family members.
