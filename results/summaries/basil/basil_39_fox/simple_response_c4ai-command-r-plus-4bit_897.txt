SUMMARY: A heated debate on same-sex marriage has erupted within the Cheney family, with Mary Cheney, the openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, taking to Facebook to criticize her sister, Liz Cheney, for her stance on the issue. Mary Cheney and her wife, Heather Poe, have been married since 2012, and Mary strongly advocates for equal rights and freedom for all families, regardless of their composition. Liz Cheney, a Republican candidate for the Wyoming Senate, has stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes that the matter should be decided by the people in each state, not by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that the matter is not something to be decided by a majority vote, and that all families deserve equal rights and protections. The dispute highlights a divide not only between the sisters but also between Liz Cheney and her father, who has publicly supported same-sex marriage, albeit with the caveat that it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The moral dilemma here is between individual freedom and equality, and the belief in traditional values and states' rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
