Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the Cheney sisters' conflict over same-sex marriage. My task is to first identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a concise summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment or imply a value judgment. So I'll go through the article and pick out words that express approval, disapproval, or relate to ethical issues.

Looking at the article, I see words like "blast," "wrong," "freedom," "entitled," "pro-gay marriage," "show of hands," "challenge," "support," and "controversial." Each of these seems to carry some moral weight. For example, "blast" shows disapproval, "wrong" indicates a moral judgment, "freedom" is a positive value, etc.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be under 200 words and should clearly present the conflict between the sisters, their positions, and the broader implications.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the conflict, then outline each sister's stance, mention their father's support, and note the political implications. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to preserve the author's framing.

I also need to ensure that the summary is clear and concise, capturing all essential points without unnecessary details. I'll start with the main conflict, then each sister's argument, and conclude with the significance of their father's stance and the upcoming election.

Alright, I think I've got a good plan. I'll list the morally framed words first and then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has criticized her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary blasted Elizabeth on Facebook, stating that her position was "dead wrong" and arguing that freedom means equal rights for all families, regardless of their composition. Elizabeth, however, believes the issue should be decided on a state-by-state basis, not by judges or legislators, and has declared she is not "pro-gay marriage." Mary strongly disagrees, asserting that such decisions should not be left to a "show of hands." Elizabeth is challenging incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, while their father, Dick Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage and echoed Elizabeth's stance on state-level decision-making. The debate highlights the ongoing controversy over marriage equality and the role of states versus individuals in shaping such policies.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
