SUMMARY: 
A public moral dispute between sisters Mary and Elizabeth Cheney, daughters of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has surfaced. Mary Cheney, who is openly lesbian and married to her wife Heather Poe, took to Facebook to blast her older sister Elizabeth for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney advocated for freedom and equal rights for all families, regardless of their composition, stating that "all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." She criticized her sister's position that the matter should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis, arguing that it is not something to be decided by a show of hands. Elizabeth Cheney, who has announced her plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in Wyoming's Republican primary in 2014, has articulated her opposition to same-sex marriage, preferring the issue to be decided by the people in each state rather than by judges or legislators. Their father, former Vice President Cheney, has publicly supported same-sex marriage but agrees with Elizabeth that the decision should be left to the states. Mary Cheney's Facebook post highlights the moral dilemma within the family, demonstrating a clash of values and beliefs surrounding the issue of same-sex marriage.
