SUMMARY:
A family feud has erupted between Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, and her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney blasted her sister on Facebook, saying she is "dead wrong" on the issue of marriage, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families are "entitled" to the same rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney believes the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by "judges" or "legislators", and has stated she is not "pro-gay marriage". Mary Cheney countered that it's not something to be decided by a "show of hands", and that all families deserve equal rights. The sisters' father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and also believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. END OF SUMMARY.
