SUMMARY:

In a public display of sibling disagreement, Mary Cheney, an openly lesbian woman, took to Facebook to criticize her sister Elizabeth Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, over her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney expressed her love for her sister while strongly disagreeing with her views, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Elizabeth Cheney believes that same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that it's not something to be decided by a show of hands, implying that it's a matter of fundamental human rights. Notably, their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and also believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. The sisters' disagreement highlights the ongoing debate over this contentious issue.
