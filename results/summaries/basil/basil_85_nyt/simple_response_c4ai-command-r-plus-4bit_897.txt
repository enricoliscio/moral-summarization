SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices", and hinted at possible intervention if the censorship continues. He positioned himself as a defender of free speech, arguing that social media platforms should "let everybody participate, good & bad". Mr. Trump's comments come amidst increasing scrutiny and enforcement of guidelines by social media companies to combat misinformation and partisan division, particularly ahead of the midterm elections. Several platforms have banned pages and accounts involved in disruptive activities, and have taken action against far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for hateful and violent speech. Mr. Jones had previously appealed to Mr. Trump to block the censorship and highlight alleged Chinese infiltration of American election systems. The President's tweets also touched on his affinity for conspiracy theories and his criticism of traditional press freedoms, including his desire to "open up" libel laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
