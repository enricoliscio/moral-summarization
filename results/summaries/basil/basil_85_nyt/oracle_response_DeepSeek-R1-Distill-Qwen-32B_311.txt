Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump accusing social media of discriminating against conservatives and hinting at intervention. Social media companies are facing pressure for their role in misinformation and partisan division. They've banned some accounts, including Alex Jones, for hateful and violent speech. Trump supports Jones and accuses China of infiltrating elections, while also attacking the media as fake news. He wants everyone to participate, even if they're bad, and has shown hostility towards press freedoms.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: discriminating, censorship, dangerous, let, division, disrupt, hateful, violent, come, point, penetrated, infiltrated, smart, tough, prepared, speech, violating, inciting, violence, participate, fake, attacks, hostility. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by stating Trump's accusation of discrimination and censorship. Then mention the social media companies' actions against misinformation and division. Include the removal of Jones's content and his plea to Trump. Highlight Trump's support for Jones and the shift to China, using terms like penetrated and infiltrated. Mention his stance on letting everyone participate, including bad actors, and his criticism of the media as fake. Finally, note his hostility towards press freedoms and desire to open libel laws.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral terms are preserved. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, covering each main point with the appropriate moral language.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media platforms of discriminating against conservative voices, calling censorship "dangerous" and vowing to prevent it. Social media companies, facing criticism for their role in spreading misinformation and partisan division, have banned accounts linked to election disruption, including those tied to Alex Jones, who was removed for hateful and violent speech. Jones urged Trump to block censorship and highlight Chinese infiltration of elections, a claim Trump echoed. Trump also criticized social media for unfairly targeting Republicans, while insisting they should "let everybody participate, good & bad." Despite this, Trump has attacked traditional media as "fake news" and shown hostility toward press freedoms, even suggesting changes to libel laws. His comments reflect a broader tension over free speech, censorship, and the role of social media in shaping public discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
