SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He claimed that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." Trump's tweets came after social media companies banned several pages and accounts, including those of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for promoting hateful and violent speech. Jones had pleaded with Trump to block the companies' actions and make censorship a major issue before the midterms. Trump's affinity for conspiracy theories was on full display as he appeared to take Jones' side, accusing social media companies of discriminating against Republicans. Trump's attacks on news coverage he doesn't like and his hostility towards traditional press freedoms have raised concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
