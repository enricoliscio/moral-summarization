SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of "totally discriminating" against conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." This comes after social media companies removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, citing "hateful and violent speech." Jones pleaded with Trump to block the companies' actions, claiming that the "communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated" the American election system. Trump appeared to take Jones' cue, tweeting that people should look into China's involvement in the election system. The president's tweets sparked concerns about his affinity for conspiracy theories and hostility towards traditional press freedoms. Trump's attacks on social media companies and news outlets have been relentless, with him vowing to "open up" libel laws. The controversy highlights the dangers of censorship and the importance of free speech in a democratic society.
