Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article starts with President Trump accusing social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting at possible intervention. He mentions that social media is discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, and he's against censorship. Then, it talks about social media companies facing pressure from lawmakers and users over misinformation and partisan division, so they've stepped up enforcement, banning some accounts involved in disrupting the midterms, including Alex Jones' content for hate speech.

Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, urged Trump to block the companies' actions and make censorship an issue before midterms, also mentioning Chinese influence on elections. Trump responded by suggesting looking at China as well as Russia for election interference. The article also mentions that Trump has accused social media of bias before, and conservatives argue that platforms are shadow-banning them. Twitter denies shadow banning but has had issues defining their hate speech policies. They initially didn't remove Jones' content but later took minor actions. Other platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Spotify have more severely restricted Jones.

In his tweets, Trump wants everyone to participate on social media, even if they're "good & bad," but he's been attacking unfavorable news coverage and opposing press freedoms. He wants to change libel laws, though they're state laws.

Now, the moral framing: The author seems critical of Trump's stance, suggesting he's using censorship as a political tool. The author points out contradictions in Trump's argumentsâ€”wanting free speech but attacking media he dislikes. Also, the author implies that Trump's focus on China might be a distraction from real issues, and that his claims about censorship are part of a broader pattern of attacking the media and promoting conspiracy theories.

So, the summary needs to capture these points: Trump's accusation of censorship, social media's response, Alex Jones' role, Trump's mention of China, the issue of shadow banning, the author's critical view of Trump's arguments, and the implication that Trump is using this issue politically.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral perspective that the author presents, which is that Trump is using the issue to his political advantage and that his arguments are inconsistent.
