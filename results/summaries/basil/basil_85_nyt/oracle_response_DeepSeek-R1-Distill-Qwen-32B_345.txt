Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, around 200 words, that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is accusing social media of discriminating against conservatives, using terms like censorship and dangerous. He's hinting at intervention. Social media companies are facing pressure and have banned some accounts, including Alex Jones, for hateful and violent speech. Trump also mentions China's influence, which ties into the idea of being penetrated and infiltrated. He wants everyone to participate, even if they're bad, and criticizes fake news, showing hostility towards traditional press.

Now, I need to extract the key points and incorporate the moral words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's claims about discrimination and censorship. Then, note the companies' actions against misinformation and division. Include the removal of Jones' content and his plea to Trump. Then, Trump's mention of China and his stance on letting everyone participate. Also, highlight his criticism of fake news and his hostility towards press freedoms.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each sentence includes relevant moral terms without making it sound forced. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, making sure the summary is under 200 words. Let me piece it together, checking each point and the use of the moral words.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media platforms of discriminating against conservative voices, warning that censorship is dangerous and vowing not to let it happen. He criticized the platforms for their role in spreading misinformation and deepening partisan division, particularly targeting accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections. Major platforms have banned far-right figures like Alex Jones for hateful and violent speech, but Trump urged them to "let everybody participate, good & bad," even as he criticized news outlets like CNN and MSNBC as "fake news." Trump also hinted at China's potential infiltration of the U.S. election system, echoing Jones' claims. The president's comments reflect his long-standing hostility toward press freedoms and his desire to "open up" libel laws. Social media companies, meanwhile, have struggled to enforce their policies consistently, with some platforms taking stronger action against Jones than others. Trump's stance on free speech and his criticism of censorship highlight his broader conflict with social media and traditional media. END OF SUMMARY.
