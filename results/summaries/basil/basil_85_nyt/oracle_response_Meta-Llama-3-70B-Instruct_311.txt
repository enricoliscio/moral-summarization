SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of "totally discriminating" against conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged social media companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." This comes after several conservative accounts, including Alex Jones', were banned for promoting "hateful and violent speech" and attempting to "disrupt" the midterm elections. Trump's tweets echoed Jones' plea to block social media companies' actions and "come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue." Trump also accused China of "penetrating and infiltrating" the American election system, saying that the US should be "smart, tough, and well prepared" to get along with everyone. The president's comments have sparked concerns about his hostility towards traditional press freedoms and his attacks on news coverage he doesn't like.

END OF SUMMARY.
