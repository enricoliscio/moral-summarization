SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, suggesting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He claimed that censorship is dangerous and vowed that his administration would not allow it. Social media platforms have recently increased their enforcement of guidelines, banning accounts involved in disruptive activities and removing content from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Mr. Trump's comments align with concerns raised by other conservatives about alleged shadow banning on Twitter. Twitter has denied shadow banning but has taken limited action against Jones. Mr. Trump urged platforms to allow everyone to participate while also attacking news outlets like CNN and MSNBC as fake news. The president has a history of hostile comments toward traditional press freedoms and has threatened to change libel laws. His tweets on Saturday also included a suggestion that China, not just Russia, should be scrutinized for election interference.
END OF SUMMARY.
