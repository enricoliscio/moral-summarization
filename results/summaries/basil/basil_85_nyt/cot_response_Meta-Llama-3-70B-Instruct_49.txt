SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, claiming that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." He hinted that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. Trump's comments came after several social media platforms removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, citing hateful and violent speech. Jones had urged Trump to block the companies' actions and "come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue." Trump appeared to take Jones' cue, accusing social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He tweeted that "all of the fools" should look at China's alleged interference in the US election system, rather than just focusing on Russia. Trump's comments have sparked concerns about his views on press freedoms, as he has previously vowed to "open up" the nation's libel laws. END OF SUMMARY.
