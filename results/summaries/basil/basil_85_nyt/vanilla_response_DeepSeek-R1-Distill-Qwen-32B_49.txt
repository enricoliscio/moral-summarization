Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Trump accusing social media companies of censoring conservative voices. He's hinting at possible intervention if accounts of his allies get shut down. He mentions that social media is discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, and he's against censorship.

Social media companies are under pressure from lawmakers and users because of their role in spreading misinformation and causing partisan divisions. They've been enforcing their policies more strictly, banning pages and accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections. They also removed content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, for hate speech.

Alex Jones asked Trump to block these actions and make censorship a big issue before the midterms. Trump responded by suggesting that the focus on Russia should also include China, hinting at their involvement in election interference. He also criticized social media companies for not letting everyone participate, even though he's been attacking the media himself.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start with Trump's accusations, mention the companies' actions against misinformation, Alex Jones's plea, Trump's response about China, and his stance on social media's role. I'll also note his criticism of the media despite his own attacks on them.

Let me structure it: Trump accuses social media of bias, companies have been enforcing policies, removed Alex Jones, Jones asked Trump for help, Trump mentions China, and criticizes social media's censorship while attacking the media.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Also, need to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media platforms of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting at potential intervention if Republican accounts continue to be banned. He criticized the platforms for discriminating against Republicans and warned against censorship, stating it is "very dangerous." Social media companies have faced pressure over their role in spreading misinformation and have taken action by banning accounts linked to election interference and removing content from far-right figures like Alex Jones. Jones, whose content was restricted by major platforms, urged Trump to address censorship before the midterms and accused China of infiltrating U.S. elections. Trump responded by suggesting the focus on Russia should also include China. Despite his criticism of social media's enforcement, Trump has consistently attacked traditional media, even vowing to reform libel laws. END OF SUMMARY.
