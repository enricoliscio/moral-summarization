SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he may intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that social media companies are "totally discriminating" against Republican and conservative voices, calling censorship a "very dangerous thing." Trump's comments come after social media companies have banned several pages and accounts, including those of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for promoting misinformation and hateful speech. Jones had appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions and make censorship a major issue before the midterm elections. Trump appeared to take up Jones' cause, tweeting that social media companies should "let everybody participate, good & bad" and accusing them of biased attacks on conservative views.

END OF SUMMARY.
