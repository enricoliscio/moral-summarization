Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about President Trump's claims that social media is unfairly targeting conservative voices, specifically mentioning Republican accounts being censored. He hints at possibly intervening if this continues. The article also talks about social media companies taking action against misinformation and partisan content, like banning Alex Jones and his website Infowars for hate speech. Trump supports this but also accuses the companies of bias against Republicans, especially on Twitter. He also brings up China's role in election interference, comparing it to Russia. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, within 200 words, and maintain the original moral perspective, which seems to be critical of social media's actions and Trump's response. I should structure it to highlight Trump's accusations, the companies' enforcement, the impact on Alex Jones, and Trump's broader concerns about censorship and China. I need to make sure it's clear and sticks to the key points without getting too detailed.

Trump urged social media to allow all voices, including "good & bad," while also raising concerns about Chinese interference in elections, comparing it to Russian efforts. The article highlights Trump's ongoing criticism of social media's policies and his broader skepticism toward press freedoms, despite his claims to oppose censorship. END OF SUMMARY.
