SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged social media companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." Trump's comments came after several conservative accounts, including Alex Jones', were banned or restricted for promoting hateful and violent speech. Trump has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans. He has also waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he doesn't like, and has expressed hostility towards traditional press freedoms. Trump's tweets sparked concerns about his willingness to intervene in the regulation of social media companies. END OF SUMMARY.
