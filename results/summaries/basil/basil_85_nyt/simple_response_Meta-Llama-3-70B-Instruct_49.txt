SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He claimed that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that social media companies are discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. Trump's comments came after several social media platforms removed content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, for hateful and violent speech. Trump echoed Jones' plea to block the companies' actions and make censorship a major issue before the midterm elections. Trump also accused social media companies of being biased against Republicans, citing the removal of Jones' content as evidence. He urged social media companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad," but his own history of attacking news coverage and press freedoms raises concerns about his true intentions.
