SUMMARY:
President Trump has accused social media companies of *censorship* and *discrimination* against conservative voices, suggesting he may intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. Trump's comments come amid increased enforcement by social media platforms to tackle misinformation and partisan division, particularly in the context of the upcoming midterm elections. Several pages and accounts have been banned for their involvement in disruptive activities, including Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, who was removed from multiple platforms for spreading *hateful* and *violent* speech. Jones has appealed to Trump to block these actions and to expose alleged Chinese infiltration of the US election system. Trump has echoed Jones' claims, suggesting that focus should also be directed towards China. This is not the first time Trump has alleged *discrimination* by social media companies against Republicans, and he has previously criticized Twitter's alleged practice of *shadow banning*. While Trump advocates for free speech online, his stance contradicts his own *attacks* on news coverage he disagrees with and his hostility towards traditional press freedoms, including his desire to "open up" libel laws.
