Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want a summary that includes the morally charged words from the original text. 

Looking at the article, it's about President Trump accusing social media of censoring conservatives. He mentions things like "discriminating," "censorship," and "dangerous." These words carry strong moral implications, so I should make sure to include them in the summary.

Next, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "discriminating," "censorship," "dangerous," "unfairly," "hateful," "violent," "penetrated," "infiltrated," "biased," "sick," "hostility," "freedoms," "injustices," and "oppressed." These words are key to the moral arguments presented.

Now, for the summary. I have to condense the article into under 200 words, making sure to include those moral terms. I'll start by stating Trump's main complaint about social media discrimination. Then, mention the companies' actions against misinformation and Alex Jones. Highlight Trump's call for intervention and his conspiracy theory about China. Also, include his stance on media freedom and attacks on news outlets. Finally, note the broader implications of his rhetoric on free speech and bias.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all the main points without losing the moral framing. I'll check the word count to make sure it's concise. Let me put it all together now.

**STEP 1:**

* Discriminating  
* Censorship  
* Dangerous  
* Unfairly  
* Hateful  
* Violent  
* Penetrated  
* Infiltrated  
* Biased  
* Sick  
* Hostility  
* Freedoms  
* Injustices  
* Oppressed  

**SUMMARY:**  

President Trump accused social media platforms of unfairly discriminating against conservative voices, calling censorship "dangerous" and vowing to prevent it. Social media companies, under pressure for spreading misinformation and partisan division, have banned accounts linked to disruptive activity, including those tied to far-right figures like Alex Jones. Jones urged Trump to block these actions and highlight Chinese infiltration of elections, a claim Trump echoed, warning to also focus on China. Trump criticized social media for "shadow banning" conservatives, though platforms deny bias. He also defended media participation, even for "bad" actors, while attacking traditional press freedoms. His rhetoric reflects broader concerns about free speech and perceived bias in digital spaces.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
