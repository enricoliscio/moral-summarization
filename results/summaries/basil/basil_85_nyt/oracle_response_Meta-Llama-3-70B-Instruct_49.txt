SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He tweeted that censorship is a "very dangerous thing" and that social media companies should "let everybody participate, good & bad." This comes after several pages and accounts were banned for being involved in activity intended to disrupt the midterm elections and for promoting hateful and violent speech. Trump's ally, Alex Jones, was also banned for his far-right conspiracy theories and violent speech. Jones urged Trump to block the companies' actions and "come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue." Trump appeared to do just that, accusing social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and promoting division. He also expressed hostility towards traditional press freedoms, vowing to "open up" the nation's libel laws. Trump's tweets sparked concerns about his administration's stance on free speech and censorship. END OF SUMMARY.
