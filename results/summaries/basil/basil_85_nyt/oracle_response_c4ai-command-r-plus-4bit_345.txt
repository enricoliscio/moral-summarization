SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly discriminating against conservative voices, hinting at intervention if the censorship continues. He claims that social media platforms are "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices," and that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." This comes as social media companies have promised to enforce their guidelines more strictly, banning pages and accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections and spreading hateful and violent speech. Mr. Trump urges these companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad," while also waging attacks on news coverage he disagrees with and expressing hostility towards traditional press freedoms. He also suggests that China, not just Russia, may have infiltrated the American election system. Mr. Trump's comments reflect a larger concern among conservatives about biased attacks on their views and the concept of shadow banning. While Twitter denies shadow banning users, it has struggled to define its policies on hate speech, and its actions against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones have been relatively minor compared to other platforms. Mr. Jones has had his content severely restricted or removed by Apple, Facebook, Google, and Spotify, but Twitter's initial response was more lenient.
END OF SUMMARY.
