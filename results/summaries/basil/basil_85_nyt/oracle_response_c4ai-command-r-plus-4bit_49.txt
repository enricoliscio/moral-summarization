SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly discriminating against conservative voices, suggesting that such censorship is dangerous and hinting at possible intervention. Social media platforms have recently taken action against accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections and spreading hateful and violent content, including that of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Trump's comments align with Jones's plea for the President to block these actions and highlight alleged Chinese infiltration of the American election system. This follows previous accusations by Trump of social media bias against Republicans and shadow banning, despite Twitter's denials. While Trump advocates for free participation, his criticism of fake news and traditional press freedoms indicates hostility towards the press. His threat to "open up" libel laws also raises concerns about free speech and the role of social media in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
