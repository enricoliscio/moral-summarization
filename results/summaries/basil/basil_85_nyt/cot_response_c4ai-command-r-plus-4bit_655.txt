SUMMARY:
President Trump has accused social media platforms of "discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices," suggesting that their actions amount to *censorship*. In a series of tweets, he warned that censorship is a "dangerous" practice and asserted that his administration will not tolerate it. This follows recent moves by social media companies to enforce their guidelines more strictly, banning accounts and pages spreading misinformation and engaging in disruptive activities ahead of the midterm elections. Notably, far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars have been subject to content removals and restrictions by major platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Spotify, and Twitter. Jones had pleaded with Trump to intervene and make censorship a central issue in the midterms, even suggesting that "communist Chinese" election infiltration be highlighted over Russian interference. Trump's tweets echo concerns raised by other conservatives about alleged *shadow banning* and biased attacks on their views. While Trump claims to support free expression, even for "*fake news*" networks like CNN and MSNBC, his administration has been criticized for its *relentless* attacks on unfavorable news coverage and *hostile* stance towards traditional press freedoms, including threats to "open up" libel laws. Trump's stance on social media censorship raises questions about the balance between free speech and the need to combat misinformation and harmful content online.
