SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that "Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices" and that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." Trump's comments come after social media companies removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and other accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections. Jones had appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions, and Trump appeared to respond by accusing China of penetrating and infiltrating the American election system. Trump also urged social media companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad," despite his own history of attacking news coverage he dislikes. The president's comments have sparked concerns about his views on press freedoms and the role of social media in promoting misinformation.
