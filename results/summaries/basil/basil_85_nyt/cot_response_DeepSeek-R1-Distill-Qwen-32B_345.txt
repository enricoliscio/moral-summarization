Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. The first step is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I need to summarize the article while preserving those moral terms. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about President Trump's accusations against social media companies for censoring conservative voices, specifically mentioning Republican/Conservative voices being discriminated against. He talks about censorship, which he sees as dangerous. He also mentions the role of social media in misinformation and partisan division, and the companies' enforcement practices. 

I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a judgment or imply a value. Let me go through the article again:

- "discriminating" against Republicans: that's a moral term because it's about unfair treatment.
- "censorship" is dangerous: censorship itself is a moral issue as it relates to free speech.
- "bias" is mentioned in the context of enforcement practices, implying unfairness.
- "hateful" and "violent" speech: these are clearly moral terms.
- "penetrated" and "infiltrated" by China: these imply a threat, which is a moral concern.
- "sick behavior": refers to something wrong or bad.
- "hostility" towards press freedoms: shows opposition to something seen as negative.
- "fake news": a term used to discredit media, implying they're deceptive.
- "open up" libel laws: suggesting a need for change, which is a moral stance.

I think I have all the moral words now. Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these terms. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the key points: Trump's accusations, the companies' actions against conservative voices, the mention of China, and the broader implications on free speech and bias.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's main claim, then the companies' responses, the role of Alex Jones, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to include the moral terms to preserve the framing as per the user's request.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and captures all the essential points without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words. Also, I should end with the specified tokens as instructed.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing by including the identified terms.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discriminating  
* Censorship  
* Dangerous  
* Republican/Conservative  
* Biased  
* Hateful  
* Violent  
* Penetrated  
* Infiltrated  
* Sick  
* Hostility  
* Fake  
* Open up  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump accused social media platforms of unfairly discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, claiming censorship is dangerous. He hinted at potential intervention to prevent such bias, particularly as major platforms have banned accounts linked to misinformation and partisan division, including those of far-right figures like Alex Jones. Jones, whose content was removed for hateful and violent speech, urged Trump to block these actions and highlight Chinese interference in elections, which Trump partially echoed. Trump also criticized social media for shadow banning and urged platforms to allow all voices, including "good & bad," while expressing hostility toward traditional press freedoms. Despite his claims of protecting free speech, Trump has repeatedly attacked unfavorable news coverage and even suggested loosening libel laws. END OF SUMMARY.
