SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He claimed that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that social media companies are discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. Trump's tweets came after far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' content was removed from major platforms for promoting hateful and violent speech. Jones had appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions and make censorship a major issue. Trump appeared to take Jones' side, accusing social media companies of biased attacks on conservative views. He urged them to "let everybody participate, good & bad," but his own history of attacking news coverage he dislikes and expressing hostility towards traditional press freedoms raises concerns about his true intentions.

END OF SUMMARY.
