Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's comments regarding social media censorship. He claims that conservative voices, especially his allies, are being unfairly censored. He mentions that social media companies are discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, and he's hinting at possible intervention if this continues.

The social media companies have been under pressure to enforce their policies more strictly, especially regarding misinformation and partisan content. They've banned several accounts linked to disrupting the midterm elections and removed content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, due to hate speech.

Alex Jones asked Trump to block these actions and make censorship a big issue before the midterms. Trump responded by suggesting that people should look at China's influence, not just Russia, and criticized the companies for their actions.

The article also mentions that Trump has accused social media of bias before, and while some platforms like Twitter have taken minor actions against Jones, others like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Spotify have more severely restricted his content.

Trump wants social media to let everyone participate, even if they're not good, and he's against removing "fake news" from networks like CNN and MSNBC, though he's been critical of the media himself.

So, the key points are:
- Trump accuses social media of censoring conservatives.
- Companies have banned accounts and removed Jones' content.
- Trump supports free participation on social media, despite his criticism of the media.
- He also brings up China's influence, similar to what Jones suggested.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include these main points clearly and concisely.
