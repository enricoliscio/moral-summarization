SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that social media is "totally discriminating" against Republican and conservative voices, calling censorship "a very dangerous thing." This comes after several social media companies banned accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections, including far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones had appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions, and Trump appeared to respond by tweeting that people should look into China's alleged interference in the US election system, rather than just focusing on Russia. Trump has previously accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and has waged attacks on news coverage he doesn't like.

END OF SUMMARY.
