Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump accusing social media platforms of unfair censorship against conservatives. He mentioned that social media is discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, and he's hinting at possible intervention if accounts keep getting shut down. 

The article also talks about social media companies facing pressure over misinformation and partisanship. They've banned some accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections and removed content from Alex Jones. Trump responded to Jones' plea by suggesting looking into China's influence, not just Russia. 

I should include the key points: Trump's accusation, the companies' actions against misinformation, Alex Jones' situation, and Trump's mention of China. Also, note his stance on social media letting everyone participate, despite his criticism of news outlets. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Trump's statement, mention the companies' actions, reference Alex Jones, Trump's response, and his stance on social media. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going into too much detail.
