SUMMARY: President Trump has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices, claiming that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." He hinted that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down, stating that his administration won't allow such discrimination to happen. Social media companies have recently banned several pages and accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections and have removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for hateful and violent speech. Jones appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions and to highlight alleged Chinese infiltration of the American election system. Trump's tweets also accused China of election interference and vowed to "get along with everyone" if the US is smart, tough, and well-prepared. Twitter has denied shadow banning users but has taken minor steps against Jones, whose content has been severely restricted by other major platforms. Trump urged social media companies to allow everyone to participate, but his own attacks on news coverage and traditional press freedoms raise questions about his commitment to free speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
