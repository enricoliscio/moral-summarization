Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump criticizing social media for unfair censorship against conservative voices. He mentioned that social media is discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He's hinting at possible intervention if his allies' accounts keep getting shut down. 

Social media companies have been under pressure from lawmakers and users because of their role in spreading misinformation and increasing partisan divisions. They've stepped up their enforcement by banning some pages and accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections. Most platforms removed content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, for hateful speech.

Alex Jones asked Trump to block these actions and make censorship a big issue before the midterms. He also urged Trump to point out Chinese infiltration into the election system, which is worse than the Russians. Trump responded by suggesting people look at China as well, not just Russia.

This isn't the first time Trump has accused social media of bias against Republicans. He's been critical of platforms' enforcement and shadow banning, where posts become invisible except to the poster. Twitter denied shadow banning but struggled to define their hate speech policies. They initially didn't remove Jones's content but later suspended his accounts for inciting violence.

Trump wants social media to let everyone participate, good or bad, and doesn't want "fake news" networks like CNN and MSNBC removed. However, he's been attacking unfavorable news coverage and is hostile to press freedoms, even talking about changing libel laws.

So, the summary should cover Trump's criticism of social media censorship, the companies' actions against misinformation, Alex Jones's appeal, Trump's response about China, his past criticisms, the platforms' enforcement against Jones, and his stance on free participation versus press freedom.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the main actors, their actions, and the implications.
