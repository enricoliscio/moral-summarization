Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump accusing social media of censoring conservative voices, specifically mentioning Republicans and conservatives being discriminated against. He talks about censorship being dangerous and not letting that happen. 

Next, the article mentions social media companies banning pages and accounts involved in disrupting midterm elections, and removing content from Alex Jones for hateful speech. Trump seems to support Jones and suggests that the issue should be made bigger before the midterms. He also brings up China's role in election interference, which is another conspiracy angle.

I need to identify the morally framed words. From the article, words like "censored," "discriminating," "Republican/Conservative," "censorship," "dangerous," "won't let that happen," "ban," "disrupt," "hateful," "violent," "infiltrated," "penetrated," "unfairly," "shadow banning," "bias," "sick behavior," "hostility," "press freedoms," "libel laws." These words carry moral implications and are used to frame the issue as a problem of fairness and bias.

Now, for the summary, I have to condense the article into 200 words, keeping these moral terms. I'll start by stating Trump's accusation, mention the companies' actions against misinformation, highlight the targeting of conservative voices, and Trump's support for Jones. I'll also include his comments about China and the broader context of his criticism of media and press freedoms. I'll make sure to include the key moral words to preserve the author's framing.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: Trump's accusation, the companies' actions, the impact on conservatives, Trump's support and additional conspiracy points, and the broader implications of his stance on media and press. Keeping it concise but covering all main points while preserving the moral language is key.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump accused social media platforms of unfairly censoring conservative voices, claiming they discriminate against Republicans and conservatives. He warned that censorship is dangerous and vowed not to allow it. Social media companies, under pressure over misinformation and partisan division, have banned accounts linked to election disruption and removed content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, for hateful speech. Trump echoed Jones’ call to make censorship a major issue before the midterms and hinted at Chinese interference in elections, tying it to the broader narrative of bias. Trump also criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, calling them “fake news,” while opposing the removal of their content. Despite his claims of supporting free speech, Trump has consistently attacked unfavorable news coverage and expressed hostility toward press freedoms, even suggesting changes to libel laws.
