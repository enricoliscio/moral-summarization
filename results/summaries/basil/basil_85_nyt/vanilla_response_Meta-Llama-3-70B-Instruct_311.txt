SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that "Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices" and that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." Trump's comments come after social media companies removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and other accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections. Jones had urged Trump to block the companies' actions and make censorship a major issue. Trump also appeared to echo Jones' conspiracy theory that China has infiltrated the American election system. Trump has previously accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and has waged attacks on news coverage he doesn't like.

END OF SUMMARY.
