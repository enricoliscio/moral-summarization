SUMMARY: 
President Trump accused social media platforms of "discriminating" against Republican/Conservative voices, claiming that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." He hinted at possible intervention if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down, stating that social media companies should "let everybody participate, good & bad." This comes amid heightened enforcement of guidelines by social media companies, who have banned pages and accounts involved in disrupting the midterm elections and removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for hateful and violent speech. Jones had previously appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions and to expose alleged Chinese infiltration of American election systems. Trump's tweets also reflected his long-standing "hostility" towards traditional press freedoms and his affinity for conspiracy theories. He has previously threatened to "open up" libel laws, despite them being state laws. Trump's accusations of "discrimination" against Republicans are not new; he joined conservatives in criticizing Twitter's alleged "shadow banning" of users, though Twitter denies the practice. The platform initially resisted removing Jones's content but later suspended his accounts for inciting violence. Trump's stance on free speech, however, seems selective as he tolerates "fake news" networks like CNN and MSNBC despite his frequent attacks on their coverage.
END OF SUMMARY.
