SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media platforms of discriminating against conservative voices, suggesting that he may intervene if the censorship continues. He claimed that social media companies are "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices," and that "censorship is a very dangerous thing." This comes amid increased enforcement by social media companies to combat misinformation and partisan division, including the banning of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from multiple platforms. Trump's comments echo those of other conservatives who believe their views are being unfairly targeted. Twitter has denied claims of "shadow banning" users, but has struggled to define its policies on hate speech. Trump urged social media companies to allow everyone to participate, even those with "sick behavior," while also condemning mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC as "fake news." Trump's comments reflect his longstanding affinity for conspiracy theories and hostility towards press freedoms, including his desire to "open up" libel laws.
END OF SUMMARY.
