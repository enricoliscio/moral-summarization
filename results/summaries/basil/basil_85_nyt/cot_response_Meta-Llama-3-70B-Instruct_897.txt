SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly discriminating against conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged social media companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." Trump's comments came after several platforms removed content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, for hateful and violent speech. Jones had pleaded with Trump to block the companies' actions and "come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue." Trump has long had an affinity for conspiracy theories and has waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he does not like, expressing hostility toward traditional press freedoms. END OF SUMMARY.
