SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He tweeted that social media is "totally discriminating" against Republican and conservative voices, and that censorship is a "very dangerous thing." Trump's comments come after social media companies banned several pages and accounts, including those of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for promoting hateful and violent speech. Jones had appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions and make censorship a major issue before the midterm elections. Trump also appeared to take up Jones' cause, tweeting that China, not Russia, should be the focus of election interference concerns. The president has long accused social media companies of biased attacks on conservative views, despite Twitter's denial of "shadow banning" users.
