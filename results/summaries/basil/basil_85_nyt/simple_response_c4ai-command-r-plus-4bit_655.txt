SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices", hinting at possible intervention if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. This comes amid increased enforcement by social media platforms against misinformation, partisan division, and hate speech, which has resulted in the banning of several pages and accounts, including that of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Mr. Trump's comments align with those of other conservatives who believe their views are being unfairly targeted through shadow banning and other tactics. Twitter has denied shadow banning users but has struggled to define its policies on hate speech. While Mr. Trump advocates for free speech on social media, his own attacks on the press and threats to libel laws raise questions about his commitment to the First Amendment. The President's tweets also reflect his affinity for conspiracy theories, as he suggests that China, not Russia, may have interfered in American elections. Mr. Trump's stance on social media censorship highlights a complex moral dilemma between preserving free speech and addressing harmful content online.
END OF SUMMARY.
