SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media companies of "totally discriminating" against conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." This comes after social media companies removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for "hateful and violent speech." Trump appeared to take Jones' plea, accusing China of "penetrating and infiltrating" the American election system, and saying that the US should be "smart, tough, and well prepared" to get along with everyone. Trump has a history of accusing social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and has waged relentless attacks on news coverage he doesn't like, expressing hostility towards traditional press freedoms. His tweets sparked concerns about the spread of misinformation and partisan division. END OF SUMMARY.
