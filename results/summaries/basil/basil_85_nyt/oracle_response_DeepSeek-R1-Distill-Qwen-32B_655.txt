Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I have to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about President Trump accusing social media of discriminating against conservative voices, hinting at intervention. He mentions censorship and the danger of it. Social media companies have been taking down accounts involved in disrupting elections, especially Alex Jones. Trump wants them to let everyone participate, even if they're bad. He also brings up China's role in elections, similar to Russia. The article also touches on Trump's history of attacking news coverage and his stance on press freedom.

Now, I need to structure this into a concise summary. I should start with Trump's accusation of discrimination and censorship. Then mention the companies' actions against disruptive content. Include Trump's call for letting everyone participate and his mention of China. Finally, note his attacks on news and hostility towards press freedom.

I should use the morally framed words from the list: discriminating, censorship, dangerous, let, division, disrupt, hateful, violent, come, point, penetrated, infiltrated, smart, tough, prepared, speech, violating, inciting, violence, participate, fake, attacks, hostility.

I need to make sure each of these words is included where appropriate without making the summary too long. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.
