SUMMARY:
President Trump accused social media companies of unfairly censoring conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that social media companies should "let everybody participate, good & bad." This comes after several platforms removed content from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for hateful and violent speech. Trump has long had an affinity for conspiracy theories and has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans. He has also waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he does not like, and has expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms. Trump's tweets sparked concerns about biased attacks on conservative views and the spread of misinformation. END OF SUMMARY.
