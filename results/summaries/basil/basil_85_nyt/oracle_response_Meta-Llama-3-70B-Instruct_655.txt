SUMMARY:

President Trump accused social media companies of "totally discriminating" against conservative voices, hinting that he might intervene if his allies' accounts continued to be shut down. He tweeted that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and urged companies to "let everybody participate, good & bad." Trump's comments come as social media companies face pressure to step up their enforcement practices, having banned several pages and accounts involved in activity intended to disrupt the midterm elections. Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, was recently removed from several platforms for hateful and violent speech. Jones appealed to Trump to block the companies' actions, claiming communist China has "penetrated and infiltrated" the American election system. Trump echoed Jones' sentiments, accusing social media companies of biased attacks on conservative views. Twitter has denied "shadow banning" users, but has struggled to define its policies against hate speech. Trump's tweets sparked concerns over his hostility towards traditional press freedoms and his vow to "open up" the nation's libel laws. END OF SUMMARY.
