SUMMARY: President Trump has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices, suggesting that he may intervene if his allies' accounts continue to be shut down. He claims that social media censorship is dangerous and that his administration will not tolerate it. Social media companies have recently increased their enforcement against accounts spreading misinformation and divisive content, particularly ahead of the midterm elections. This has resulted in bans and content removals for several far-right figures, including Alex Jones. Trump's comments echo those of other conservatives who believe their views are being unfairly targeted. Twitter, in particular, has been accused of shadow banning users, though it denies the practice. Trump has also used his tweets to divert attention to China, suggesting that the country poses a greater threat to elections than Russia. Despite his defense of free speech on social media, Trump has a history of attacking news coverage he dislikes and threatening libel law changes.
END OF SUMMARY.
