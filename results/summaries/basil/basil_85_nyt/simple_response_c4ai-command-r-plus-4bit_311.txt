SUMMARY: President Trump accused social media platforms of discriminating against conservative voices and hinted at possible intervention if the censorship continued. He asserted that social media companies should allow everyone to participate and not suppress certain viewpoints, despite his own attacks on the press and news coverage he dislikes. Mr. Trump's comments came amid increased enforcement by social media companies against misinformation, hate speech, and election disruption, which has resulted in the banning of several pages and accounts, including those of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones had previously appealed to the President to block the companies' actions and make censorship a key issue in the midterm elections, linking it to alleged election interference by China. The President's tweets also reflected his ongoing criticism of social media bias against Republicans and his administration's stance against such discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
