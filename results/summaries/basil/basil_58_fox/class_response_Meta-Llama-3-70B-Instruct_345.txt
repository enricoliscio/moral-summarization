SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing significant obstacles. Christie's popularity has plummeted in his home state, and he has been "dogged by scandals" that have led to a decline in his fundraising efforts. As a result, his status as the establishment favorite for the GOP nomination has vanished. Many of his former mega-donors have shifted their support to his rivals, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality may still be an asset in the race. He has become skilled at hosting town hall meetings, where he takes questions from residents and leaves a lasting impression, often evoking strong emotions. Despite his challenges, Christie's announcement is not to be written off just yet.
