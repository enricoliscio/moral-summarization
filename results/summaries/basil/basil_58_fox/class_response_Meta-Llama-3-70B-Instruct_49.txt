SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been marred by scandals, which have led to a decline in his popularity in his home state. As a result, many mega-donors have shifted their support to his rivals, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality may still be an asset in his campaign, as he has become skilled at connecting with voters through town hall meetings. His ability to leave a lasting impression on voters, whether it be through laughter, tears, or hope, may help him stay in the running. Despite his challenges, Christie's announcement is not one to be written off just yet.
