Despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges, Christie is known for his brash and combative personality, which could set him apart from other candidates. However, he has been dogged by scandals and his popularity has plummeted in his home state, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. Christie's strength lies in his ability to connect with people during town hall meetings, leaving a lasting impression with his straightforward and often emotional approach.
