Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally framed words, particularly "scandals." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Chris Christie announcing his candidacy for the 2016 Republican nomination. He's facing challenges like low poll numbers, fundraising issues, and scandals. The author mentions that his status as the establishment favorite has faded due to these scandals and his declining popularity in New Jersey. Mega-donors are moving to other candidates like Jeb Bush. However, the article also notes that Christie has a strong personality and is effective in town hall meetings, which might help him despite his challenges.

Now, I need to create a concise summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Christie's announcement, his uphill battle, the scandals, the loss of donor support, and his personality as an asset. I must make sure to use "scandals" as it's a morally framed word. 

I should structure the summary to highlight both the challenges and his potential strengths. Start with the announcement, mention the uphill climb, the reasons (scandals, low polls, fundraising), the loss of donors to Bush, and then his strong personality and town hall effectiveness. 

Let me draft this, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today. Despite facing significant challenges, including low poll numbers, a fundraising deficit, and scandals that have eroded his popularity, Christie remains a contender. His status as the establishment favorite has faded, with mega-donors shifting their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality, honed through his town hall performances, could be his key asset. His ability to engage with constituents, even as he polarizes opinions, may help him stand out in the crowded field. END OF SUMMARY.
