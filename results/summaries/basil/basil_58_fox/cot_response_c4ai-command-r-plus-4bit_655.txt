SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House race, despite facing an *uphill* battle with low poll numbers and a fundraising *deficit*. Once considered the establishment favorite for the GOP nomination, Christie's status has now *vanished*, *dogged* by *scandals* and *plummeting* approval ratings in his home state. While some mega-donors have *drifted* towards his rivals, Christie's unique *asset*—his brash and combative personality—could still prove advantageous. Known for his town hall meetings, Christie has mastered the art of engaging with residents, leaving some *enraged* but many more *laughing*, *weeping*, or *hoping* for a personal connection. Despite the challenges, Christie remains a contender, refusing to be *written off*.
END OF SUMMARY.
