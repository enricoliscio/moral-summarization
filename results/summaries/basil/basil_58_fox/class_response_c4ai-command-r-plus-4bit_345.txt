SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing an uphill battle. Christie's popularity has waned due to scandals and low poll numbers, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. However, his mastery of the town hall meeting and his charismatic, brash personality could still make him a formidable candidate. Haberman notes that Christie has a unique ability to connect with people, often leaving them "enraged but many more laughing, weeping or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand." Christie's announcement will come from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey, as he attempts to revive his once-promising campaign.
