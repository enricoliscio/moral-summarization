Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for the White House. They mentioned I should preserve the moral framing from the original text. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture both the challenges he's facing and the positive aspects of his campaign style.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Christie is entering the race, despite low poll numbers and fundraising issues. He's facing scandals and losing support from donors, who are moving to Jeb Bush instead. But the article also highlights his strong personality and ability to connect with people in town hall meetings. 

I should balance these elements in the summary. Maybe start with his announcement and the uphill battle, then mention the scandals and fundraising deficit. Then contrast that with his strengths: his personality, the town hall performances, and how he connects with the audience, even if it's polarizing.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include both the challenges and his potential strengths. Also, make sure to include the sources mentioned, like Robert Costa and Maggie Haberman, to maintain the original framing.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first state the announcement, then the challenges, followed by his strengths, ending with the mixed reactions. That should give a balanced view as per the original article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the 2016 Republican nomination today, despite facing significant challenges. His once-promising campaign has been derailed by scandals, declining popularity, and a loss of support from major donors, who are now backing rivals like Jeb Bush. Christie’s uphill battle is further complicated by low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. However, as Maggie Haberman of the New York Times notes, Christie’s brash, combative personality and his ability to connect with voters in town hall settings could be his strongest assets. His performances, often leaving audiences laughing, crying, or even enraged, reflect a unique approach to campaigning. Despite his struggles, Christie’s magnetic presence and ability to engage with constituents may yet give him a chance in the crowded Republican field. END OF SUMMARY.
