SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges. While his popularity has waned, with mega-donors shifting their support to rivals like Jeb Bush, Christie's unique selling point is his brash and combative personality, which he will use to his advantage in the campaign. Christie is a master of town hall meetings, engaging with residents and leaving a lasting impression, be it positive or negative. His ability to connect with people on an individual level cannot be overlooked, and he remains a formidable contender despite the challenges ahead. Christie's announcement will be a bold move, and his personality-driven campaign strategy may just be what is needed to shake up the race.
