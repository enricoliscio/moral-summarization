SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing ethical challenges and an uphill battle for the nomination. While Christie's popularity and fundraising abilities have diminished, his unique selling point remains his brash and combative personality, which he will use to his advantage in the campaign. Christie's skill in connecting with people during town hall meetings, as described by Maggie Haberman, cannot be overlooked, and he has the potential to surprise his rivals and captivate voters. However, ethical concerns surround Christie, as highlighted by Robert Costa, who mentions scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, causing mega-donors to shift their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. Christie's announcement, made from his hometown of Livingston, marks the beginning of a challenging journey for the Republican nomination.
