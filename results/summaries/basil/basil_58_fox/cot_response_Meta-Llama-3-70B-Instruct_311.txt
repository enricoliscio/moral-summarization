SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been marred by scandals, which have led to a plummeting popularity in his home state. However, he remains a strong contender, poised to run a race that sells his brash and combative personality as his main asset. Christie has mastered the town hall meeting, leaving some people enraged, but many more laughing, weeping, or hoping he would connect with them on a personal level. While his status as the establishment favorite has vanished, Christie's ability to connect with people on a personal level may just give him the edge he needs to succeed. END OF SUMMARY.
