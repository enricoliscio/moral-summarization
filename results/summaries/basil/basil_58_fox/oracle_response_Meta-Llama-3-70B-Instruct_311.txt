SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an "uphill climb" due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's "status as the establishment favorite" has "vanished" amidst scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state. Many mega-donors have "drifted toward his rivals", including Jeb Bush. However, Christie's "brash, challenging, and often combative" personality may be his main asset in the race. He has mastered the town hall meeting, leaving some people "enraged" but many more "laughing, weeping, or hoping" for a personal connection. Christie's ability to connect with people on a personal level may be his ticket to success.

END OF SUMMARY.
