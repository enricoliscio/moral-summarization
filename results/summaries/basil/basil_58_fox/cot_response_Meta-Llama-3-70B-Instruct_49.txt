SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been dogged by scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals, including Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash, challenging, and often combative personality may be his main asset in the race. He has mastered the town hall meeting, leaving some people enraged, but many more laughing, weeping, or hoping he would connect with them. Christie's announcement today will mark a significant moment in the 2016 Republican nomination race. END OF SUMMARY.
