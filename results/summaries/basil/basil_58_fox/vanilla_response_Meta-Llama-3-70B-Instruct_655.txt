SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today. Despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit, Christie remains a contender. His popularity in his home state has plummeted, and many mega-donors have shifted their support to rivals, including Jeb Bush. However, Christie's strong personality, which is often described as brash, challenging, and combative, could be a major asset in his campaign. He has mastered the town hall meeting format, taking questions from residents and leaving a lasting impression. While his chances may seem slim, Christie's ability to connect with voters on a personal level could make him a dark horse in the race.
