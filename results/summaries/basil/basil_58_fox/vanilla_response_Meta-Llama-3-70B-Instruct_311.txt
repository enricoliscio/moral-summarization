SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today. Despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit, Christie's personality-driven campaign may still be a viable option. Christie's strengths lie in his ability to connect with voters through town hall meetings, where he takes questions from residents and showcases his brash, challenging, and often combative personality. This approach has left some people enraged, but many more laughing, weeping, or hoping to meet him. Christie's establishment favorite status has vanished due to scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals, including Jeb Bush. However, his unique campaign style may still make him a contender.
