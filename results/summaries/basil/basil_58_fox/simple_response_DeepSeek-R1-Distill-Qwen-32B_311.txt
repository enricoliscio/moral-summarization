Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his candidacy. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions Christie is announcing his run for the White House, despite low poll numbers and fundraising issues. It also talks about scandals and his diminished support from donors, who are now backing Jeb Bush instead. However, it contrasts this with his strong personality and town hall performances, which might be his main asset.

I need to make sure the summary includes both the challenges and his potential strengths. The moral framing here seems to highlight the contrast between his personal appeal and his political struggles. So, I should emphasize that while he's facing uphill battles, his brash and engaging style could be his saving grace.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating his announcement, mention the challenges, then pivot to his strengths. I'll end by noting the potential impact of his personality-driven campaign.

Let me structure it: Introduction of the announcement, mention the low polls and fundraising issues, reference the loss of donors, then shift to his town hall skills and personality. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today in Livingston, New Jersey. Despite facing significant challenges, including low poll numbers, a fundraising deficit, and dwindling support from major donors due to scandals and declining popularity, Christie remains a formidable contender. His status as the GOP establishment's favorite has diminished, with donors shifting toward rivals like Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality, honed through his town hall performances, could be his key asset. His ability to engage with constituents, even if it leaves some enraged, has earned him a loyal following. While his path to the nomination is steep, his campaign may hinge on leveraging his unique style to connect with voters.
