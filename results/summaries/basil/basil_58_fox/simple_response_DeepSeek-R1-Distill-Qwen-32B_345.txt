Alright, so I need to help the user summarize a news article about Chris Christie announcing his candidacy for the 2016 White House run. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the original author used. 

First, I should read the article carefully. It mentions Christie's uphill climb due to low poll numbers and fundraising issues. There's a contrast between his past as an establishment favorite and his current struggles with scandals and losing donors to Jeb Bush. But the article also highlights his strong personality and town hall skills, making him a formidable candidate despite the challenges.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the challenges and his strengths. The moral framing here is about Christie's resilience and his use of personality as a campaign tool, despite his setbacks. I should balance the negative aspects with the positive traits to reflect the author's perspective accurately.

I'll start by mentioning his announcement and the uphill battle. Then, I'll note the loss of establishment backing and donor support. Next, I'll highlight his strengths: his personality, town hall effectiveness, and the mixed reactions he gets. Finally, I'll conclude that he's a serious contender despite the obstacles.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without being too verbose.

However, Christieâ€™s brash and combative personality, honed through his town hall performances, remains a key asset. While some find him polarizing, his ability to engage and inspire supporters could make him a formidable contender. Despite the uphill battle, his campaign hinges on leveraging his unique style to connect with voters. END OF SUMMARY.
