SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing significant challenges. His popularity has plummeted in his home state, and he's been dogged by scandals, causing many mega-donors to shift their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. However, Christie's strong personality, which is often described as brash, challenging, and combative, could be a major asset in his campaign. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving a lasting impression on voters. While his poll numbers are low, and fundraising is a concern, Christie's ability to connect with people on a personal level could help him overcome these obstacles.

Moral framing: Christie's announcement is a testament to his perseverance and determination in the face of adversity. His willingness to run a campaign that focuses on his personality and connection with voters suggests that he values authenticity and transparency. Despite his flaws, Christie's commitment to engaging with citizens and listening to their concerns is a commendable quality in a political leader.
