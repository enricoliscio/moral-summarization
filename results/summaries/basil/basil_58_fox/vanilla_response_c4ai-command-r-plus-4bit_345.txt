SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, joining a crowded field of contenders. Despite facing challenges such as low poll numbers, fundraising deficits, and scandals, Christie is known for his brash and combative personality, and is a skilled town hall meeting performer. His ability to connect with people and his establishment credentials are seen as potential assets in the race. However, his popularity has waned, and many mega-donors have shifted their support to rival candidates like Jeb Bush. The announcement is set to take place in his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey, and Christie is expected to emphasize his personality and record as his main strengths in the campaign.
