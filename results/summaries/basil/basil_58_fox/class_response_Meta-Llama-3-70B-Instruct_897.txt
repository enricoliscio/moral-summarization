SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been marred by scandals, which have led to a decline in his popularity in his home state. As a result, many mega-donors have shifted their support to his rivals, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality may still be an asset in his campaign. He has honed his skills in town hall meetings, where he takes questions from residents and leaves a lasting impression, often evoking strong emotions. While his chances may seem slim, Christie's ability to connect with people on a personal level could make him a contender in the GOP nomination.
