SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House race, despite facing an *uphill* battle. Governor Christie's popularity has been on a downward spiral, with low poll numbers and a fundraising *deficit*. Once the establishment favorite, his status has now *vanished*. *Dogged* by *scandals* and decreasing popularity in his home state, he has lost the support of many mega-donors who have drifted towards his rivals. However, Christie's brash, challenging, and often *combative* personality remains a strong asset. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, engaging with New Jersey residents and leaving a lasting impression. While some may be enraged by his style, many others are won over by his charisma. Despite the challenges, don't *write* him off just yet.
END OF SUMMARY.
