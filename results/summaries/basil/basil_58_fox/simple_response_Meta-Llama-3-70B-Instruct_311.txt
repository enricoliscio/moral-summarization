SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing significant challenges. His popularity has plummeted in his home state, and he's been dogged by scandals, causing many of his former mega-donor supporters to shift their allegiance to rivals, such as Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash, challenging, and combative personality could be his greatest asset. He's mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving a lasting impression on attendees, who often leave laughing, weeping, or hoping for a personal connection. Christie's announcement today will mark a crucial moment in his campaign, as he attempts to overcome his low poll numbers and fundraising deficit.
