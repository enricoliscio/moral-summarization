SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House race, joining a crowded Republican field. Despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges, Christie is known for his brash and combative personality, which could be his main asset in the race. However, he has been dogged by scandals and his popularity in his home state has plummeted, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. Nevertheless, Christie's skill at connecting with people during town hall meetings cannot be overlooked, and he has a talent for leaving a lasting impression.
