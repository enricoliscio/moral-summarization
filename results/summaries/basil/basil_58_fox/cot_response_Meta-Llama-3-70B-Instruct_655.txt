SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House run, despite facing an uphill climb for the nomination. His popularity has been plummeting in his home state, and he has been dogged by scandals, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. However, Christie's brash, challenging, and often combative personality may be his main asset in the race. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving some people enraged, but many more laughing, weeping, or hoping he would connect with them on a personal level. Christie's announcement will be made in his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey, at 11am today. END OF SUMMARY.
