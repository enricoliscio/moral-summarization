SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been marred by scandals, which have led to a decline in his popularity in his home state. As a result, many mega-donors who once supported him have shifted their allegiance to his rivals, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality may prove to be an asset in his campaign, as he has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving a lasting impression on many New Jersey residents. Despite the challenges ahead, Christie's announcement is not to be written off just yet.
