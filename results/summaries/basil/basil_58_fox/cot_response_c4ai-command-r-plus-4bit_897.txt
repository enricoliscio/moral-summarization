SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House race, despite facing an *uphill* battle. With low poll numbers and a fundraising *deficit*, Christie's status as the GOP establishment favorite has faded. He has been plagued by *scandals* and his popularity has plummeted, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. However, Christie's *maestro* of the town hall meeting and his brash, challenging, and often *combative* personality could be his *saving grace*. He has mastered the art of taking questions from New Jersey residents, leaving some *enraged* but many more *weeping* or *hoping* to shake his hand. Only time will tell if Christie's late entry into the race and *hats* in the ring will be enough to secure the nomination.
END OF SUMMARY.
