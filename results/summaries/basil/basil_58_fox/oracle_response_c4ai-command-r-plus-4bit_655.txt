SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is about to throw his hat into the ring for the White House race, despite an ethical quagmire of scandals and a deficit in fundraising. While his popularity and support from mega-donors have diminished, some still believe in his chances due to his unique selling point: his brash and challenging personality. Christie is a maestro of the town hall meeting, unafraid to face his constituents and leave them enraged, laughing, weeping, or hopeful. This ability to stir emotion and connect with people may be his secret weapon in the race for the Republican nomination. However, with low poll numbers and an uphill battle ahead, only time will tell if his strategy will pay off. Christie's announcement is expected to be made today at 11 am from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.
