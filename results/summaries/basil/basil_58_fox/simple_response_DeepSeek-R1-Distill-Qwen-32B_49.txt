Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Chris Christie announcing his candidacy. They mentioned I should preserve the moral framing. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the positive and negative aspects as presented.

First, I'll read through the article again. It talks about Christie's uphill battle due to low polls and fundraising issues. That's the negative part. But then there's the positive spin about his personality and town hall skills. I need to balance both without adding my own opinions.

I should start by stating the announcement and the challenges. Then, mention the scandals and donor shift to Jeb Bush. After that, highlight his strengths like his personality and town hall effectiveness. Make sure to include both Robert Costa's and Maggie Haberman's points.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: announcement, challenges, scandals, donor shift, then his strengths, and conclude with the mixed outlook. That should cover the moral framing without bias.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the 2016 presidency, though he faces significant challenges. Despite being once seen as the GOP establishment's favorite, Christie's popularity has declined due to scandals and low poll numbers, leading major donors to shift their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality, honed through his town hall meetings, could be his key asset. While his fundraising and public image are struggles, his ability to connect with voters through direct, often confrontational interactions may help him stand out in the crowded Republican field. END OF SUMMARY.
