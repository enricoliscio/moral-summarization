SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is bravely stepping into the ring and announcing his candidacy for the 2016 White House race. His odds for the Republican nomination appear to be unjustly diminishing, as he faces an uphill battle with low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. The once-favored Christie has seen his popularity plummet in his home state, causing mega-donors to shift their support to rival candidates such as Jeb Bush. However, Christie's strongest asset—his brash, challenging, and often combative personality—should not be underestimated. He has mastered the art of the town hall meeting, engaging New Jersey residents in a suit, taking questions, and leaving a lasting impression, be it laughter, tears, or the hope that he might grasp their hand. Christie's campaign strategy will undoubtedly revolve around his unique persona, and it may just be the ace up his sleeve that helps him defy the odds.
