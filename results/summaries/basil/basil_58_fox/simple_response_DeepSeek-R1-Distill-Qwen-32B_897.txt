Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I'm both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on capturing the essence of the article, including the challenges and strengths of Chris Christie's campaign.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about NJ Governor Chris Christie announcing his candidacy for the 2016 White House run. The article mentions his uphill battle due to low poll numbers and fundraising issues. There's a reference to Robert Costa from The Washington Post noting that Christie's status as the establishment favorite has faded because of scandals and loss of support from donors, who are now backing Jeb Bush instead.

On the flip side, Maggie Haberman from The New York Times highlights Christie's strong personality and his effectiveness in town hall meetings, where he connects with people despite some backlash. So, the article presents both the challenges and the unique strengths Christie brings to his campaign.

Now, I need to summarize this in under 200 words, keeping the moral framing. That means I should present both the negative aspects (scandals, low polls, fundraising issues) and the positive traits (charismatic, strong personality, town hall skills) to give a balanced view.

I'll start by stating Christie's announcement, then mention his challenges, followed by his strengths. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll also make sure to include key details like the location of the announcement and the sources cited.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and captures all necessary points. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Once done, I'll format it with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the 2016 presidency, despite facing significant challenges. His campaign is hampered by low poll numbers, a fundraising deficit, and a diminished status as the GOP establishment favorite, as noted by *The Washington Post*. Scandals and declining popularity in New Jersey have led major donors to shift their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. However, *The New York Times* highlights Christie's potential as a candidate who leverages his brash and combative personality, excelling in town hall settings where he connects with voters, even if it polarizes them. Despite the obstacles, Christie's unique appeal could make him a formidable contender. END OF SUMMARY.
