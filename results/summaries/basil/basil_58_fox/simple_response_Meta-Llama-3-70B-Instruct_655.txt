SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing significant challenges. His popularity has plummeted in his home state, and he has been dogged by scandals, causing many of his former mega-donor supporters to drift towards his rivals, including Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality, which has been honed through his town hall meetings, may yet prove to be his greatest asset. His ability to connect with people on a personal level, leaving them laughing, weeping, or hoping for a handshake, may help him overcome his low poll numbers and fundraising deficit. While the road ahead will be tough, it would be premature to write Christie off just yet.

END OF SUMMARY.
