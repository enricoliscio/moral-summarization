SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today. Despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit, Christie's brash and combative personality may be his strongest asset. According to the New York Times, Christie has mastered the town hall meeting format, taking questions from residents and leaving a lasting impression. However, scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state have led many mega-donors to shift their support to rivals, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Christie's announcement will take place at 11am in his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.
