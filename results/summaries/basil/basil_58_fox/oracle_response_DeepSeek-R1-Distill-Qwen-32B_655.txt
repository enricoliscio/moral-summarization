Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for the presidency. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article mentions that Christie is expected to announce his candidacy, which is an important point. It also talks about his uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. That's a negative point, indicating challenges. The author uses terms like "scandals" and "plummeting popularity," which are strong moral words showing Christie's downfall.

There's a quote from Robert Costa about Christie losing his status as the establishment favorite and donors moving to Jeb Bush. That highlights Christie's struggle and the shift in support, which is another negative aspect. 

On the other hand, the article also mentions Christie's personality as an assetâ€”brash, challenging, combative. Maggie Haberman's quote describes his town hall performances, which leave people with strong reactions, some enraged, others moved. This shows his ability to connect with people despite his style, which could be a positive or negative depending on the audience.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral elements: uphill climb, low poll numbers, fundraising deficit, scandals, plummeting popularity, establishment favorite, mega-donors drifting, and his personality as an asset. Also, the contrast between his struggles and his potential appeal through his personality is important.

I should structure the summary to first state that Christie is announcing his candidacy, then mention the challenges he faces, followed by the reasons for his struggles, and finally touch on his potential strengths despite these issues. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while preserving the moral framing.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions or additional information not in the article. Just stick to the key points and the moral language used. Also, ensure the summary flows logically from his announcement to his challenges and then his potential appeal.

Let me draft it step by step: Start with the announcement, then the uphill climb and reasons (low polls, fundraising issues), mention the loss of establishment support and donor shift, and conclude with his personality as a strength despite the negatives.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral framing as per the user's request.
