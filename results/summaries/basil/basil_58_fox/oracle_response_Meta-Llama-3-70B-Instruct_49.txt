SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an "uphill climb" due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's "status as the establishment favorite for the GOP nomination has vanished" as he has been "dogged by scandals" and his popularity has plummeted in his home state. However, he still has a chance to win over voters with his "brash, challenging and often combative" personality, which has made him a "maestro of the town hall meeting". Christie's ability to connect with people, leaving them "laughing, weeping or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand", could be his main asset in the race. Despite his flaws, Christie's authenticity and charisma may still make him a contender.
