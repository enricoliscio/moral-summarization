SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been marred by scandals, which have led to a decline in his popularity in his home state. As a result, many of his former mega-donors have shifted their support to his rivals, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality may still be an asset in the race. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving a lasting impression on many New Jersey residents. While some may be enraged by his approach, many more are drawn to his charismatic style, which may help him stay in the running.

END OF SUMMARY.
