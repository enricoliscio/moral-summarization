SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the White House, despite facing significant challenges. His popularity has plummeted in his home state, and he trails behind in fundraising, leading many mega-donors to shift their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality could be his strongest asset in the race. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving a lasting impression on voters, who are often moved to laughter, tears, or even outrage. While his chances may seem slim, Christie's unique approach could still make him a contender.
