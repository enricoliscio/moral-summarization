SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an "uphill climb" due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been "dogged" by scandals, causing his popularity to plummet in his home state. As a result, many of his former mega-donor supporters have "drifted toward his rivals," including Jeb Bush. However, Christie's "brash, challenging, and often combative" personality may be his strongest asset, allowing him to connect with voters on a personal level. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving some people "enraged" but many more "laughing, weeping, or hoping" for his attention. Despite his struggles, Christie's announcement is not to be written off just yet.
