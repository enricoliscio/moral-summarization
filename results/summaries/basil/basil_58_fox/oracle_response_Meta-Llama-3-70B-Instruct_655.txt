SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an "uphill climb" due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit. Christie's reputation has been "dogged" by scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, causing many mega-donors to "drift toward his rivals". However, Christie's "brash, challenging, and often combative" personality may be his strongest asset. He has mastered the art of town hall meetings, leaving some people "enraged" but many more "laughing, weeping, or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand". Christie's announcement is a bold move, as he attempts to sell his personality as his main asset, despite being considered a less popular choice.
