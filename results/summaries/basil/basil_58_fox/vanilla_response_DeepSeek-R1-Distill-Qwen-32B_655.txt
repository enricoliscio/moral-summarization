Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for the presidency. Let me read through the article first.

The article says that NJ Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy today. He's making the announcement in his hometown of Livingston at 11 am. The article mentions that he faces an uphill battle because his poll numbers are low and he's struggling with fundraising. It also talks about how his status as the GOP establishment favorite has faded due to scandals and lower popularity in New Jersey. Mega-donors are moving to other candidates like Jeb Bush. 

But the article also points out that Christie has a strong personality, which he uses effectively in town hall meetings. He's good at engaging people, even if it makes some angry, but others are really moved by his style.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: his announcement, the challenges he's facing, his low poll numbers, fundraising issues, the loss of donor support, and his strong personality as a campaign asset. I should make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

I'll start by stating that Chris Christie is announcing his candidacy today. Then mention the challenges like low polls and fundraising. Then note the loss of donors and mention Jeb Bush. Finally, highlight his personality and town hall skills as his main assets.

I need to make sure it's concise and flows well. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, I should avoid any markdown and just present the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Alright, putting it all together now.
