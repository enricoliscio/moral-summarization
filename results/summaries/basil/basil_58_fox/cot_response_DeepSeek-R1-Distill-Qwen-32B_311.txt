Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his candidacy for the 2016 White House race. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article mentions that Christie is expected to announce his candidacy today. He's a Republican, so that's a political angle. The key points include his uphill climb for the nomination, low poll numbers, and fundraising deficit. These are all challenges he's facing, which might carry a negative moral tone, implying difficulty or unpopularity.

Then, it quotes Robert Costa from The Washington Post, saying that Christie's status as the establishment favorite has vanished. He's been dogged by scandals and has low popularity in his home state. Mega-donors are drifting to his rivals, like Jeb Bush. The word "dogged" here suggests he's been persistently troubled, which is a negative moral framing.

Maggie Haberman from The New York Times points out that Christie's main asset is his personality—brash, challenging, and combative. He's good at town hall meetings, engaging with people, which makes some enraged but others supportive. Words like "brash" and "combative" could be seen as morally charged, depending on context. They might imply a strong or confrontational approach, which could be viewed positively or negatively.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all single words that are morally framed. Let me go through the article again:

- "Throw his hat in the ring" is a metaphor, not a single word.
- "Expected" is neutral.
- "Up hill climb" is a phrase, but "climb" isn't morally framed.
- "Low poll numbers" and "fundraising deficit" are challenges, but not single moral words.
- "Status as establishment favorite" – "favorite" is neutral.
- "Vanished" is neutral.
- "Dogged by scandals" – "dogged" implies persistence, which is negative.
- "Plummeting popularity" – "plummeting" is negative.
- "Drift toward rivals" – "drift" is neutral.
- "Mega-donors" – neutral.
- "Toasted him" – metaphor, not a word.
- "Posed to run a race" – neutral.
- "Sell his personality" – "sell" is neutral.
- "Brash, challenging, combative" – these are descriptive but could carry moral connotations.
- "Maestro of town hall meetings" – "maestro" is positive.
- "Standing in a suit" – neutral.
- "Taking questions" – neutral.
- "Leaving some people enraged" – "enraged" is negative.
- "Many more laughing, weeping, hoping" – "laughing," "weeping," "hoping" are emotional but not necessarily moral.

So, the single morally framed words I can identify are: "dogged," "plummeting," "enraged." Maybe "challenging" and "combative" could also be considered as they describe his personality in a way that could be seen as confrontational, which might carry a moral judgment depending on context.

Wait, "challenging" and "combative" are more descriptive than morally framed. The main ones are "dogged," "plummeting," and "enraged." 

Now, for the summary, I need to include these morally framed words while keeping the summary under 200 words. I should also mention his uphill climb, low poll numbers, fundraising deficit, scandals, loss of donor support, and his personality as his main asset.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight his announcement, the challenges he faces, and his personality-driven campaign approach. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's tone.

His uphill climb for the Republican nomination is complicated by low poll numbers, a fundraising deficit, and scandals that have dogged him, leading to plummeting popularity in his home state. Mega-donors who once supported him have drifted toward rivals like Jeb Bush. However, Christie’s brash and combative personality, honed in town hall meetings, remains his key asset, leaving some enraged while resonating with many others.
