SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House race, joining a crowded Republican field. Despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges, Christie is known for his brash and combative personality, which could be his main asset in the race. However, he has been dogged by scandals and his popularity in his home state has plummeted, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. Christie's ability to connect with people at town hall meetings, leaving them laughing, weeping, or hoping to shake his hand, could be a game-changer. His challenge will be to translate that skill onto the national stage.
