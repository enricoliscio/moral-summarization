SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges. While his popularity and support from mega-donors have diminished due to scandals and low approval ratings in his home state, Christie's unique selling point is his brash and combative personality, which he effectively showcases during town hall meetings. His ability to connect with people and leave a lasting impression may be his secret weapon in the race for the White House. It remains to be seen whether Christie can overcome the obstacles and make a serious bid for the nomination. End of summary.
