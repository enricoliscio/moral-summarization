SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges. While some mega-donors have drifted towards his rivals, Christie's unique selling point is his brash and combative personality, which he uses to great effect in town hall meetings, engaging directly with the people of New Jersey. His ability to connect with people on an emotional level through his charismatic and unapologetic style should not be underestimated, and this may prove to be his secret weapon in the race for the White House. End of summary.
