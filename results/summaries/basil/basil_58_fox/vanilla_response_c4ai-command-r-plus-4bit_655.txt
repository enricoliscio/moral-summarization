SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Despite facing challenges such as low poll numbers, fundraising deficits, and scandals, Christie is known for his brash and combative personality, and is a maestro of town hall meetings, leaving many people laughing, weeping, or hopeful. His ability to connect with people and sell his personality as his main asset could be a strength in the race. However, his popularity has plummeted, and mega-donors have drifted towards his rivals. The announcement will be made at 11 am from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.
