SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, joining a crowded field of contenders. Despite facing challenges such as low poll numbers, fundraising deficits, and scandals, Christie is known for his brash and combative personality, and is a skilled town hall meeting performer. His ability to connect with people and his status as a straight-talker could be his main assets in the race. However, his popularity has waned, and many mega-donors have shifted their support to rivals like Jeb Bush. Christie's announcement will be made from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey, as he attempts to revive his fortunes and make a play for the White House.
