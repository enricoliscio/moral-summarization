SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing significant challenges. His popularity has plummeted in his home state, and he has been dogged by scandals, causing many of his former mega-donors to shift their support to rivals, such as Jeb Bush. However, Christie's brash and combative personality, as well as his ability to connect with voters through town hall meetings, may be his strongest assets. He has become skilled at taking questions from residents, often leaving a lasting impression, even if it's not always positive. While his chances may seem slim, it's too early to count him out. Christie's announcement will be made at 11am from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.
