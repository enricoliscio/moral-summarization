SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges. While his popularity and support from mega-donors have diminished due to scandals and low approval ratings in his home state, Christie's unique selling point is his brash and combative personality, which he leverages effectively in town hall meetings, engaging directly with New Jersey residents. This skill, along with his ability to connect with people on an emotional level, could be a game-changer in his campaign. Christie's announcement will take place in his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey, marking the beginning of what promises to be a challenging but potentially transformative campaign.
