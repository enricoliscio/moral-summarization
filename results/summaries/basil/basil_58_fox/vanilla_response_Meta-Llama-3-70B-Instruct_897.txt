SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today at 11am from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey. Despite facing low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit, Christie's personality-driven campaign may still pose a threat. Christie's town hall meetings, where he takes questions from residents and showcases his brash and combative personality, have left a lasting impression on many. While his establishment favorite status has vanished due to scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, Christie's campaign may still resonate with voters. Mega-donors who once supported him have drifted towards his rivals, including Jeb Bush, but Christie's unique approach to campaigning may help him stand out.
