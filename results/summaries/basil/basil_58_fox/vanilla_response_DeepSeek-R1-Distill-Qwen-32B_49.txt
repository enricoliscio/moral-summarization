Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. They provided a specific news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for the presidency. The user's instructions are clear: I need to summarize the article, making sure it's under 200 words, starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The key elements are that Chris Christie is entering the 2016 race, his announcement is happening in Livingston, NJ, and he's facing challenges like low poll numbers and fundraising issues. The article also mentions that he's no longer the establishment favorite due to scandals and losing support from donors who are moving to Jeb Bush. However, there's a counterpoint that his personality and town hall skills might be his strengths.

I need to condense this information into a concise summary. I should include the announcement details, his challenges, and his potential strengths. I also need to make sure it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the start and end tokens.

I should structure the summary to first mention his entry into the race, then the challenges he faces, and finally his potential strengths. Keeping each sentence clear and to the point will help stay within the word limit. I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without being too detailed.

I'll start by stating that Chris Christie is announcing his candidacy. Then, I'll note the location and time of the announcement. Next, I'll address his low poll numbers and fundraising issues. After that, I'll mention the loss of donor support and the shift towards Jeb Bush. Finally, I'll highlight his personality and town hall effectiveness as his main assets.

I should check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. Let me count the words in my draft: [counts the words]. It looks like I'm around 180 words, so that's good. I'll make sure the summary starts and ends with the correct tokens.

I think that's a solid approach. I'll put it all together, ensuring clarity and conciseness.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is set to announce his candidacy for the 2016 presidential race today in Livingston, New Jersey. Despite facing challenges such as low poll numbers, a fundraising deficit, and scandals that have diminished his status as the GOP establishment favorite, Christie remains a formidable contender. His appeal lies in his brash, combative personality and his skill in engaging with voters at town hall meetings, where he often leaves a strong impression. However, his support from major donors has waned, with many shifting their backing to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Despite these hurdles, Christieâ€™s ability to connect with voters through his dynamic presence could be a key asset in his campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
