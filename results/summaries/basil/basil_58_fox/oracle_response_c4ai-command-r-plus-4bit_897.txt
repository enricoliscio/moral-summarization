SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is about to throw his hat into the ring for the 2016 White House race, joining the crowded Republican field. Despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising deficits, Christie remains defiant and is expected to sell his brash and combative personality as his main asset. While some mega-donors have drifted towards his rivals, Christie's mastery of the town hall meeting, where he engages directly with New Jersey residents, often leaving them laughing, weeping, or hopeful, cannot be overlooked. The Governor's announcement, made from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey, adds another layer of intrigue to the already fascinating Republican nomination race.
