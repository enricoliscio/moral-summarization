SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb for the nomination. His campaign has been dogged by scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, causing many mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. However, Christie's brash, challenging, and often combative personality may be his main asset in the race. He has become a maestro of town hall meetings, leaving some people enraged but many more laughing, weeping, or hoping he would connect with them. While his poll numbers are low and fundraising is a deficit, Christie's ability to sell his personality may make him a contender. Don't write him off just yet.
END OF SUMMARY.
