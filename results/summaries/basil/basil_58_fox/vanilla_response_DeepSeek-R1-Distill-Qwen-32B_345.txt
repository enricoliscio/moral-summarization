Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for the presidency. Let me read through the article first.

The article says that NJ Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy today at 11 am in Livingston, NJ. He's the latest Republican to join the race for the 2016 White House. However, he's facing some challenges: low poll numbers and a lack of funds. Robert Costa from The Washington Post mentions that Christie's status as the GOP favorite has faded due to scandals and low popularity in his home state. Mega-donors are moving to other candidates like Jeb Bush.

But the article also points out that Christie isn't out yet. Maggie Haberman from the NYT explains that Christie's personality—brash, challenging, and combative—is his main asset. He's good at town hall meetings, engaging with people, which leaves some angry but others moved or hopeful.

So, the summary needs to capture that Christie is entering the race despite challenges, his low poll numbers and fundraising issues, the shift of donors to other candidates, and his unique approach to campaigning through his personality and town halls.

I should structure it to include all these points concisely, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll start by stating his announcement, mention the challenges, the loss of donors, and then his strengths in personality and town halls. I'll end with the fact that he's not to be underestimated yet.

Let me make sure to include key details: announcement time and place, challenges, donor shift, and his campaign style. Keep it clear and straightforward.
