SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 White House race, joining the crowded Republican field. Despite facing an uphill battle with low poll numbers and fundraising challenges, Christie remains confident in his ability to connect with voters. Robert Costa of The Washington Post acknowledges Christie's challenges, including scandals and declining popularity, which have caused some mega-donors to shift their support to rivals like Jeb Bush.

Christie's ability to engage directly with voters may prove to be his secret weapon in the race, as he seeks to climb his way to the top of the Republican field.
