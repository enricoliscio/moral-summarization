SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his bid for the White House today, despite facing an uphill climb for the Republican nomination. Christie's popularity has been plummeting in his home state, and he has been dogged by scandals, causing many of his mega-donors to drift towards his rivals. However, Christie's brash, challenging, and often combative personality may be his main asset in the race. He has become a master of the town hall meeting, leaving some people enraged, but many more laughing, weeping, or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand. Christie's announcement today will mark a new chapter in his campaign, one that will likely focus on selling his personality as his main strength. END OF SUMMARY.
