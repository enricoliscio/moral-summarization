SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today. Despite facing an uphill climb due to low poll numbers and a fundraising deficit, Christie's personality-driven campaign could still make him a contender. Christie's strengths lie in his ability to connect with voters through town hall meetings, where he takes questions from residents and showcases his brash, challenging, and combative personality. While scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state have led many mega-donors to drift towards rivals like Jeb Bush, Christie's campaign will focus on selling his personality as his main asset. With a strong performance in town hall meetings, Christie could still make a significant impact in the race.
