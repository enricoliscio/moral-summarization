SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person," argued former New York Mayor and business magnate Michael Bloomberg in a scathing speech at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg, a former Republican, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a terrible businessman whose election would be disastrous for the country. Bloomberg ridiculed Trump's claims of business prowess, pointing out his history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied customers and contractors who feel cheated and ripped off. The billionaire ex-mayor also highlighted Trump's hypocrisy in refusing to disclose his tax returns while boasting about his wealth. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would damage the economy, threaten retirement savings, increase debt and unemployment, and make our communities less safe. He urged Americans who want a businessperson in the White House to look elsewhere, as Trump is unqualified and unfit to lead the nation. Bloomberg's speech, characterized by its moral framing, underscored the dangers of a Trump presidency and encouraged voters to choose the sane, competent, and qualified candidate: Hillary Clinton.
