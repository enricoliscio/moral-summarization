SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person", argued former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg, a billionaire and former Republican, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president. Bloomberg highlighted Trump's bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. He mocked Trump's business prowess, ego, and intellect, contrasting them with his own achievements. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would damage America's economy, retirement savings, global influence, and community safety. He ridiculed Trump's statements on immigration, national security, and foreign trade, as well as his refusal to disclose his tax returns. Bloomberg concluded that Trump's business plan would hurt small businesses and lead to greater debt and unemployment. Voting for Clinton, a competent and sane leader, is the morally responsible choice for Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
