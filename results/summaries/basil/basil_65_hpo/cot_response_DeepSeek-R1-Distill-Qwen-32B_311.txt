Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the task. The user wants me to identify morally framed words and then create a concise summary using those words.

Looking at the article, Michael Bloomberg is speaking at the Democratic Convention, criticizing Trump and endorsing Clinton. He uses strong language to describe Trump, so I need to pick out words that carry moral judgment.

I'll go through the article and list words that have a moral connotation. Words like "sane," "competent," "dangerous," "demagogue," "bad," "disastrous," "con," "hypocrisy," "rip off," "defensively," "unwavering," "success," "disaster," "damage," "harder," "debt," "unemployment," "erode," "less safe." These words are used to convey judgment about Trump's character and policies.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms. I should mention Bloomberg's main points: Trump's business failures, hypocrisy, and the potential negative impact of his presidency. Also, highlight Bloomberg's contrast with Trump, his achievements, and his support for Clinton.

I'll structure the summary to include Bloomberg's criticism, the reasons behind it, and his endorsement of Clinton. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the tone of the original article.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll make each sentence concise, focusing on the key points: Bloomberg's speech, his critique of Trump, the comparison of their backgrounds, and the potential consequences of a Trump presidency.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it flows well and includes all the important moral elements from the article.
