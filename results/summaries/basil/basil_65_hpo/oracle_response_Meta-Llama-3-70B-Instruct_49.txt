SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, a "dangerous demagogue" and bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers who feel "ripped off" and "cheated". He accused Trump of "hypocrisy" for claiming great wealth without disclosing his net worth or releasing tax returns. Bloomberg warned that Trump's business plan would be a "disaster in the making", leading to "damage" to the economy, "threatening" retirement savings, and causing "unemployment". He also predicted that Trump would "erode" America's influence and make communities "less safe". Bloomberg favorably compared his own business and political achievements to Trump's, saying he built his business without a "million-dollar check from my father". He concluded that Trump's presidency would be a "disastrous" choice for America.
