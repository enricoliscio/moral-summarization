SUMMARY: At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, arguing that she is a "sane, competent person," unlike her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a billionaire and former Republican, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a failed businessman, highlighting his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied customers and contractors. He mocked Trump's claims of business prowess, noting that he himself built a successful business without starting with a million-dollar inheritance. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the country, damaging the economy, threatening retirement savings, increasing unemployment, and making the nation less safe. He also ridiculed Trump's positions on immigration, national security, and foreign trade while praising his own achievements in business and as mayor of New York City. Bloomberg's speech, which included unscripted jabs at Trump, emphasized the contrast between the two billionaires and underscored his support for Clinton.
