SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person," argued former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention. In an unscripted addition to his speech, Bloomberg labeled Donald Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a terrible businessman who would be disastrous as president. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican who has endorsed Clinton, criticized Trump's career, highlighting a history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. He mocked Trump's business prowess, ego, and intellect, accusing him of hypocrisy and refusing to disclose his true net worth or tax returns. Bloomberg argued that Trump's presidency would harm small businesses, the economy, retirement savings, national security, and American communities. He urged Americans who want a businessperson as president to look beyond Trump, stating that Trump's business plan would result in greater debt, unemployment, and erosion of America's global influence. Bloomberg's speech underscored the moral imperative to elect a competent and honest leader, framing the choice between Clinton and Trump in terms of sanity, competence, and integrity.
