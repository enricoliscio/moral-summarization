Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used. The article is about Michael Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic National Convention where he criticized Donald Trump and endorsed Hillary Clinton.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They listed words like "disastrous," "boasts," "cheated," "ripped," "run," "hypocrisy," "claims," "disclose," "refuses," "damage," "harder," "threaten," "lead," "debt," "unemployment," "erode," and "safe." I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The main points of Bloomberg's speech are:
1. Trump is a dangerous demagogue and bad businessman.
2. Trump's career is marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, angry stakeholders, and disappointed customers.
3. Trump's claims of wealth and success are hypocritical because he doesn't disclose his finances.
4. Bloomberg contrasts his own business success, which he built without a large inheritance.
5. He predicts Trump's presidency would damage the economy, increase debt and unemployment, and threaten safety.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton and his criticism of Trump as a dangerous demagogue. Then, mention Trump's record of bankruptcies and lawsuits, using "disastrous" and "cheated." Highlight Trump's hypocrisy regarding his wealth and refusal to disclose finances. Contrast with Bloomberg's achievements. Finally, outline the potential negative impacts of a Trump presidency using words like "damage," "threaten," "lead," "debt," "unemployment," and "erode."

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. Also, make sure to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and keep the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token.

Wait, I should also make sure that the summary is in my own words, not directly quoting the article, but preserving the moral framing. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely.
