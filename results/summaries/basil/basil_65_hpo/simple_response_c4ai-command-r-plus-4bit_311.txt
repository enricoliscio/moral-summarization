SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump because she is a "sane, competent person," argued former New York Mayor and business magnate Michael Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg, a former Republican who has endorsed Clinton, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a failed businessman whose election would be disastrous for the country. Bloomberg, a billionaire himself, mocked Trump's business acumen and questioned his claims of great wealth, pointing to his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied customers and contractors. Bloomberg argued that Trump's presidency would harm small businesses, the economy, retirement savings, and America's global influence, urging voters to choose Clinton as the morally responsible choice for the country's future. Bloomberg's speech highlighted the moral imperative to elect a sane and competent leader, framing the election as a choice between a responsible, experienced candidate and a dangerous, unqualified demagogue.
