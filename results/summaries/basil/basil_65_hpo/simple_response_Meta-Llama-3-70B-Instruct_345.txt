SUMMARY: 

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he labeled a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stakeholders, and mocked his boasts as not matching reality. He argued that Trump's business plan would be disastrous for the country, harming small businesses, the economy, and Americans' retirement savings, and eroding global influence and community safety. Bloomberg favorably compared his own business and political achievements to Trump's, highlighting his own success without inherited wealth. He warned that Trump's presidency would wreak havoc on American life, and urged voters to reject his candidacy.
