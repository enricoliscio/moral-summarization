SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a “sane, competent person,” argued former New York Mayor and business magnate Michael Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention. In a scathing critique of Republican nominee Donald Trump, Bloomberg portrayed him as a dangerous demagogue, a bad businessman, and a con artist. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican who has endorsed Clinton, highlighted Trump's bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. He mocked Trump's claims of business prowess, noting that he inherited his wealth and has refused to disclose his tax returns. Bloomberg also warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the country, harming small businesses, damaging the economy, and endangering national security. He urged Americans who want a business-savvy leader to look beyond Trump, emphasizing that he built his own business without the advantages Trump had. Bloomberg's speech, marked by moral indignation, underscored the imperative of choosing Clinton over the dangerous and unqualified Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
