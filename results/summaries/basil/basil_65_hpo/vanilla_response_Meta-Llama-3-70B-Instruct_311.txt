SUMMARY:

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke at the Democratic National Convention, endorsing Hillary Clinton and criticizing Donald Trump. Bloomberg called Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president. He highlighted Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry investors, and mocked his business prowess and ego. Bloomberg favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, noting that he built his business without a million-dollar check from his father. He warned that a Trump presidency would harm the economy, threaten retirement savings, and erode American influence around the world. Bloomberg urged Americans to vote for Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" who would make a better president.
