Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. Let me first read through the article to understand what it's about. The article is about Michael Bloomberg speaking at the Democratic National Convention, endorsing Hillary Clinton, and criticizing Donald Trump. 

I need to create a summary that's no longer than 200 words. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to capture the main points without getting too detailed.

First, I'll note that Bloomberg is a former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg L.P. He's endorsing Clinton, contrasting her with Trump. He calls Trump a dangerous demagogue and bad businessman. I should mention that Bloomberg criticized Trump's business record, pointing out bankruptcies and lawsuits. 

He also mocks Trump's claims about his wealth and the fact that he doesn't release tax returns. It's important to include that Bloomberg contrasts his own business success, which he built without a large inheritance, unlike Trump. 

Additionally, Bloomberg predicts negative impacts of a Trump presidency on the economy, retirement savings, debt, unemployment, and international influence. I should include that he's considering an independent run but ended up supporting Clinton.

I need to keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the key criticisms and endorsements. I'll structure it to first introduce Bloomberg and his endorsement, then detail his criticisms of Trump, and conclude with the potential consequences if Trump were elected. 

Let me make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and stick to the main points. Also, I'll ensure that the tone is neutral and factual, as it's a summary of the article.
