SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he deemed a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stakeholders, and mocked his boasts, saying they don't match reality. He argued that Trump's business plan would be disastrous for the economy, threatening retirement savings, leading to debt and unemployment, and eroding global influence. Bloomberg favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, highlighting his own success without inherited wealth. He warned that a Trump presidency would wreak havoc on American life, making communities less safe.
