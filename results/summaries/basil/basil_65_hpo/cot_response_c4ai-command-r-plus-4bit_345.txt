SUMMARY: 
At the Democratic National Convention, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, describing her as a "sane, competent person," in stark contrast to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, portrayed Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a terrible businessman whose election would be calamitous. Bloomberg's impromptu critique of Trump highlighted his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. He mocked Trump's business prowess, inheritance, and intellect, labeling him a "con" and pointing out his hypocrisy on wealth disclosure and defensive reactions to criticism. Bloomberg, a successful businessman and politician himself, emphasized the appeal of a business-savvy leader but warned that Trump's business plan would be a "disaster," harming small businesses, the economy, retirement savings, and America's global influence, while increasing debt, unemployment, and safety concerns. Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton underscores the grave moral and practical implications of the choice facing American voters. END OF SUMMARY.
