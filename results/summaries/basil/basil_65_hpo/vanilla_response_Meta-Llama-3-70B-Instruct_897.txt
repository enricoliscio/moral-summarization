SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, spoke at the Democratic National Convention, endorsing Hillary Clinton and criticizing Donald Trump. Bloomberg called Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president. He highlighted Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stakeholders, and mocked Trump's business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect. Bloomberg favorably compared his own business and political achievements to Trump's, noting that he built his business without a million-dollar check from his father. He warned that a Trump presidency would harm the economy, threaten retirement savings, increase debt and unemployment, erode global influence, and make communities less safe. Bloomberg urged Americans to vote for Clinton, a "sane, competent person" who would make a better president.
