Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Bloomberg is speaking at the Democratic National Convention, endorsing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. He criticizes Trump as a dangerous demagogue with a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg emphasizes Trump's lack of qualifications and the potential disasters of a Trump presidency, comparing his own achievements to Trump's failures. He also mentions his consideration for an independent bid but ended up supporting Clinton.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll focus on the key arguments Bloomberg made: Trump's incompetence, his business failures, and the negative impact of a Trump presidency. I should also highlight Bloomberg's comparison of his own success to Trump's shortcomings. The summary should be under 200 words and maintain the moral stance against Trump and in favor of Clinton.

I'll start by introducing Bloomberg and his endorsement. Then, outline his criticisms of Trump, including the bankruptcies, lawsuits, and the dangers of Trump's leadership. I'll mention the comparison between their business backgrounds and Bloomberg's warning about Trump's policies. Finally, I'll note his decision to support Clinton over an independent run.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly. I need to avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct, reflecting the moral judgment against Trump and support for Clinton as presented in the article.
