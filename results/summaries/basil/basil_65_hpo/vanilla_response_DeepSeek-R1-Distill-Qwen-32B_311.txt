Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Michael Bloomberg speaking at the Democratic National Convention. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Bloomberg is endorsing Hillary Clinton and criticizing Donald Trump. He calls Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. He mentions Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy stakeholders. Bloomberg also points out that Trump's claims of success don't match reality, and he mocks Trump's inheritance and business skills. He compares his own business success, which he built without a large inheritance, to Trump's. Bloomberg also predicts that a Trump presidency would harm the economy, retirement savings, and national influence.

I should make sure the summary includes these key points: Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, criticizing Trump's business record, the contrast between their backgrounds, and the potential negative impact of a Trump presidency. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and in a clear, formal tone.

Let me structure this: start with Bloomberg's endorsement, then his criticism of Trump's business practices, the comparison of their backgrounds, and the dire predictions about Trump's presidency. Make sure to include the main criticisms and the contrast between the two.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point to keep it within the word limit. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically from one point to the next without being too choppy.

Let me draft it: Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican and now endorsing Clinton, criticizes Trump as a dangerous demagogue with a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. He contrasts Trump's inherited wealth with his own self-made success, predicting Trump's presidency would harm the economy and national influence.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details without exceeding 200 words. Maybe add that Bloomberg mocked Trump's claims and business skills, and that Trump's policies would negatively impact various aspects of American life.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's clear and concise, and flows well.
