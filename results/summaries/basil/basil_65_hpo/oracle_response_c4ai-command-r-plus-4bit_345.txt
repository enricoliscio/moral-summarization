SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person", argued former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg, who has endorsed Clinton, delivered a scathing critique of Republican nominee Donald Trump, characterizing him as a "dangerous demagogue" and a terrible businessman whose election would be disastrous for the country. Bloomberg ridiculed Trump's business prowess, ego, and intellect, highlighting his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and history of cheating contractors and customers. He also criticized Trump's refusal to disclose his tax returns and net worth, calling it hypocrisy. According to Bloomberg, Trump's business plan would harm small businesses, damage the economy, threaten retirement savings, increase debt and unemployment, erode America's global influence, and make communities less safe. He urged Americans who want a businessperson in the White House to look beyond Trump, noting that unlike Trump, he built his own business without inheriting wealth from his father. Bloomberg's speech, which included unscripted jabs at Trump, emphasized the moral shortcomings of the Republican nominee and framed the election as a choice between competence and chaos.
