SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he labeled a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stockholders, and warned that his presidency would be a "disaster in the making". He ridiculed Trump's business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect, calling him a "con" and accusing him of "hypocrisy" for not disclosing his net worth and tax returns. Bloomberg favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, saying he built his business without a "million-dollar check from my father". He warned that a Trump presidency would lead to economic damage, unemployment, and a loss of American influence, making communities "less safe". END OF SUMMARY.
