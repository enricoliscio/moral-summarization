SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg, made a moral case for voting for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, argued that Clinton is a "sane, competent person," unlike Trump, whom he described as a "dangerous demagogue." Bloomberg criticized Trump's business record, characterizing it as a litany of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. He accused Trump of hypocrisy, citing his refusal to disclose his net worth and tax returns despite claiming great wealth. Bloomberg also highlighted the dangers of a Trump presidency, predicting it would cause great *damage* to the economy, retirement savings, national debt, unemployment, and national security. While acknowledging the *appeal* of a businessman president, Bloomberg warned that Trump's business plan would hurt small businesses and erode America's global influence. Bloomberg's speech, marked by moral framing, emphasized Clinton's competence and Trump's unsuitability, urging Americans to choose the *safest* candidate.
