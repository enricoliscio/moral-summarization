Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic National Convention. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I catch all the key points and the specific words to include.

Bloomberg is endorsing Hillary Clinton, criticizing Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. He mentions Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, angry stockholders, and disillusioned customers. He uses words like "disastrous," "boasts," "cheated," "ripped," "hypocrisy," "claims," "disclose," "refuses," "damage," "harder," "threaten," "lead," "debt," "unemployment," "erode," and "safe." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

He also contrasts his own business success without a large inheritance, which is a point to highlight. Bloomberg warns about Trump's impact on the economy, retirement savings, debt, unemployment, and national safety. I should structure the summary to first introduce Bloomberg's endorsement, then outline his criticisms of Trump, include the moral framing words, and conclude with the potential consequences of a Trump presidency.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure the summary flows well and includes all the required moral terms. Let me draft it now, ensuring I hit all the key points and include the specified words.

SUMMARY: Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and Democratic endorser, criticized Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "disastrous" president-elect. Bloomberg accused Trump of having a career marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stakeholders, arguing that Trump's boasts about his business success are hollow. He emphasized that Trump's claims of wealth are unverified, as he refuses to disclose his tax returns or net worth. Bloomberg mocked Trump's hypocrisy, noting that while Trump claims to be a great businessman, his record shows a history of cheating stockholders and customers. He warned that Trump's presidency would threaten American economic stability, lead to greater debt, unemployment, and erode national safety. Bloomberg contrasted his own business success, built without a million-dollar inheritance, to Trump's allegedly inflated claims. He urged voters to choose a competent leader, like Hillary Clinton, over Trump's disastrous vision. END OF SUMMARY.
