Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

Bloomberg is a former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg, a big financial news company. He's a billionaire and used to be a Republican, but now he's endorsing Hillary Clinton. In his speech, he criticized Donald Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. He said Trump's career has been full of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy customers. Bloomberg thinks Trump isn't a good choice for president because of his business failures and his claims don't match reality.

He also mocked Trump's wealth, saying Trump won't reveal his net worth or tax returns, and that his success is questioned. Bloomberg compared himself to Trump, mentioning he built his business without a million-dollar check from his dad and successfully ran New York City for 12 years. He also talked about how Trump's business plan would hurt the economy, increase debt, and make communities less safe. Bloomberg considered running as an independent but ended up supporting Clinton instead.

So, the key points are: Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, criticizing Trump's business record, questioning Trump's wealth and credibility, comparing his own achievements, and predicting negative impacts if Trump becomes president. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should make sure to include Bloomberg's main arguments against Trump and his reasoning for supporting Clinton. Also, highlight the contrast between their business backgrounds and the potential consequences of Trump's presidency. Keep it concise but cover all major points without getting too detailed.
