SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person," argued former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a terrible businessman who would be a disastrous president. Bloomberg, who founded the Bloomberg financial news empire, highlighted Trump's business failures, including bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied customers. He mocked Trump's claims of great wealth and his refusal to release tax returns. Bloomberg also contrasted his own achievements in business and politics, achieved without the advantages Trump had, and warned that a Trump presidency would damage America's economy, global influence, and community safety. Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton underscores the moral choice facing Americans: between a competent, experienced leader in Clinton, and a dangerous, hypocritical demagogue in Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
