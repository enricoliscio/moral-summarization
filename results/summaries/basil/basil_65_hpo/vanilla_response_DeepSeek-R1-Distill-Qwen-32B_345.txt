Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Michael Bloomberg speaking at the Democratic National Convention. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Bloomberg is endorsing Hillary Clinton and criticizing Donald Trump. He calls Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. He mentions Trump's bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy stakeholders. Bloomberg contrasts his own business success, noting he didn't start with a million-dollar check from his father. He also mocks Trump's refusal to release tax returns and his claims of wealth. Bloomberg predicts a Trump presidency would harm the economy and other areas.

I need to condense this into a few key points. Start with Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, then his criticisms of Trump's business record and character. Include the contrast between their business origins and Bloomberg's predictions about Trump's presidency. Keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise.

I'll structure it: Bloomberg at DNC, endorses Clinton, criticizes Trump's business failures, compares his own success, mocks Trump's wealth claims, and warns about Trump's impact on the country.

Let me make sure I cover all main points without going over the word limit. Maybe combine some sentences to save space. Avoid unnecessary details, focus on the key arguments Bloomberg made.

Alright, I think that's a solid plan. Now I'll draft the summary accordingly.
