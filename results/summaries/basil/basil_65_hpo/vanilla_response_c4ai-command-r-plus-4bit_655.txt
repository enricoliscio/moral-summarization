SUMMARY: At the Democratic National Convention, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, arguing that she is a "sane, competent person" and a better choice than Republican nominee Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a failed businessman, citing his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied customers. Bloomberg highlighted his own achievements in business and politics, contrasting them with Trump's inherited wealth and questionable business practices. He warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the country, damaging the economy, eroding America's global influence, and making communities less safe. Bloomberg's speech mocked Trump's ego and intellect while emphasizing the importance of electing a leader with genuine business acumen.
