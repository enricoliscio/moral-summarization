SUMMARY: 
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" in contrast to Donald Trump, who he deemed a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers who feel "cheated" and "ripped off". He mocked Trump's "boasts" and "hypocrisy", saying he won't "disclose" his real net worth and "refuses" to release his tax returns. Bloomberg warned that Trump's presidency would be "disastrous", leading to "damage" to the economy, "threatening" the retirement savings of millions, and causing "unemployment". He also predicted that Trump would "erode" America's influence worldwide and make communities "less safe". Bloomberg favorably compared his own business and political achievements to Trump's, saying he built his business without a "million-dollar check" from his father. END OF SUMMARY.
