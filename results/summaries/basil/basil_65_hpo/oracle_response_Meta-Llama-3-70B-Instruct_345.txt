SUMMARY: 
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he labeled a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by "bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." He mocked Trump's boasts, saying his business plan would be a "disaster in the making," leading to "greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence around the world and make our communities less safe." Bloomberg also accused Trump of "hypocrisy" for claiming great wealth without disclosing his real net worth and refusing to release his tax returns. He favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics with Trump's, saying he built a business without a "million-dollar check from my father." Bloomberg warned that Trump's presidency would "threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans" and make it "harder for small businesses to compete."
