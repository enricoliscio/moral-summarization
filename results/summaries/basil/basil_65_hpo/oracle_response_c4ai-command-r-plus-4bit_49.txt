SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person," argued former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican who has endorsed Clinton, delivered a scathing critique of Republican nominee Donald Trump, portraying him as a dangerous demagogue and a failed businessman. Bloomberg highlighted Trump's bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers, contrasting them with his own achievements as a self-made businessman and mayor. He accused Trump of hypocrisy, refusing to disclose his net worth and tax returns while claiming great wealth. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous, harming small businesses, the economy, retirement savings, and America's global influence, while increasing debt, unemployment, and insecurity. He urged Americans who want a businessperson in the White House to look beyond Trump, who inherited his wealth and lacks the competence and sanity to lead the nation effectively. Bloomberg's speech, marked by moral indignation, underscored the ethical implications of the choice between Clinton and Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
