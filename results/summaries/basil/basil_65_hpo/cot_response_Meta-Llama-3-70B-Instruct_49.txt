SUMMARY:
At the Democratic National Convention, Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person." In a scathing speech, Bloomberg criticized Donald Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman who would be a "disastrous" president. Bloomberg argued that Trump's career is marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stockholders, and that his boasts don't match reality. He ridiculed Trump's business prowess, inheritance, and ego, calling him a "hypocrite" who won't disclose his net worth or release his tax returns. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would wreak "dire" damage on the economy, small businesses, and American life, making it "harder for small businesses to compete" and leading to "greater debt and more unemployment."
