SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he deemed a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, citing bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers, and argued that Trump's boasts don't match reality. He also mocked Trump's business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect, calling him a hypocrite for claiming great wealth without disclosing his net worth or tax returns. Bloomberg favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, highlighting his own success without inherited wealth. He warned that a Trump presidency would wreak havoc on American life, threatening small businesses, the economy, retirement savings, and national security. Bloomberg's scathing speech made a strong case for Clinton as a competent leader.
