SUMMARY:
At the Democratic National Convention, Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" and labeling Donald Trump a "dangerous demagogue." Bloomberg, a billionaire and former New York mayor, criticized Trump's business career, highlighting a "litany of collapses and missteps." He argued that Trump's boasts don't match reality, citing "bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." Bloomberg mocked Trump's business prowess, ego, and intellect, calling him a "con" and accusing him of "hypocrisy" for not disclosing his net worth. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would be a "disaster in the making," leading to economic damage, unemployment, and a loss of global influence. END OF SUMMARY.
