Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic National Convention. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave, so I need to make sure I capture the essence of Bloomberg's arguments against Trump and his support for Clinton.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Bloomberg is criticizing Trump, calling him a dangerous demagogue and a bad businessman. He mentions Trump's bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy stakeholders. Bloomberg also mocks Trump's claims about his business success and his refusal to release tax returns. He compares himself to Trump, highlighting his own achievements without relying on his father's money. Bloomberg is endorsing Clinton, emphasizing her competence over Trump's instability.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton and his criticism of Trump as a dangerous leader. Then, mention Trump's business failures and the contrast with Bloomberg's own success. Highlight the moral points about Trump's hypocrisy and lack of transparency. Conclude with the potential negative impacts of a Trump presidency as per Bloomberg.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering Bloomberg's main arguments and the moral stance against Trump. Keeping it concise but comprehensive within the word limit is key. I'll make sure to include the key terms like "dangerous demagogue," "business failures," "hypocrisy," and the consequences of Trump's policies.

Alright, putting it all together now.
