SUMMARY:
At the Democratic National Convention, Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person." He criticized Donald Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman who would be a "disastrous" president. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, argued that Trump's career is marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stakeholders, making him unfit to run the nation. He mocked Trump's business prowess, ego, and intellect, calling him a "con" and accusing him of "hypocrisy" for refusing to disclose his net worth. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would wreak havoc on the economy, threaten retirement savings, and erode America's influence worldwide, making communities "less safe." He concluded that Trump's business plan is a "disaster in the making." END OF SUMMARY.
