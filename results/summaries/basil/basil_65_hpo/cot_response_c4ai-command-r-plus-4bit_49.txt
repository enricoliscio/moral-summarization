SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg, made an unscripted addition to his speech at the Democratic National Convention, urging Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton as a "sane, competent person" compared to her Republican rival, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman, highlighting his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. Bloomberg, a vocal critic of Trump, mocked the nominee's business prowess, inheritance, and intellect, labeling him a "con." He presented himself and Clinton as successful alternatives, emphasizing their competence and appealing to voters' desire for a leader who understands business. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous, threatening retirement savings, increasing debt and unemployment, and making our communities less safe. He urged Americans to choose Clinton as the sane, competent, and safe option over the dangerous and damaging prospect of a Trump presidency.
