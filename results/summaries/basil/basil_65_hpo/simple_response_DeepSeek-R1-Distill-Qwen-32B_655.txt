Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Bloomberg is speaking at the DNC, endorsing Hillary Clinton, and criticizing Trump. He's highlighting Trump's business failures, bankruptcies, and lawsuits, arguing that Trump isn't a competent leader. 

I should note that Bloomberg contrasts his own achievements, like building Bloomberg L.P. without a large inheritance, with Trump's claims. He also mocks Trump's policies and predicts negative impacts if Trump becomes president. The moral framing here is about competence, honesty, and the consequences of electing Trump. 

I need to make sure the summary captures Bloomberg's arguments against Trump's business acumen, his personal attacks, and the potential negative effects on the country. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the author's perspective that Trump is unfit and dangerous.
