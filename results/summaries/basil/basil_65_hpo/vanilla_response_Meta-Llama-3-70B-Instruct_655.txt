He argued that Trump's boasts don't match reality and that Americans who want a competent businessperson in the White House should look elsewhere. Bloomberg mocked Trump's business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect, saying his hypocrisy is his greatest wealth. He favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, highlighting his own success in building a business without a million-dollar check from his father.
