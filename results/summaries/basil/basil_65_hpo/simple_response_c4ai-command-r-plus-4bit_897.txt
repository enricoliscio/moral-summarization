SUMMARY: Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton, argues former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, because she is a "sane, competent person," in contrast to Republican nominee Donald Trump, whom Bloomberg characterizes as a "dangerous demagogue" and a failed businessman. Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic National Convention highlighted Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. He also criticized Trump's refusal to disclose his net worth and tax returns. Bloomberg, a former Republican himself, praised Clinton's qualifications while ridiculing Trump's statements on immigration, national security, and foreign trade. He warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the country, harming small businesses, the economy, and national security. Bloomberg's argument emphasizes the moral responsibility of voters to choose a competent and ethical leader over a dangerous and unqualified demagogue. END OF SUMMARY.
