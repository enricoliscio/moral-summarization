Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic National Convention. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave, so I have to make sure I capture the essence of Bloomberg's arguments against Trump and his endorsement of Clinton.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Bloomberg is criticizing Trump, calling him a dangerous demagogue and a bad businessman. He mentions Trump's bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy stakeholders. He also mocks Trump's claims about his business success, pointing out that he inherited money from his father and hasn't released his tax returns.

Bloomberg contrasts himself with Trump, saying he built his business without a million-dollar check from his dad. He emphasizes his experience in running New York City and argues that Trump's business plan would harm the economy, retirement savings, and national security. He supports Clinton as a competent alternative.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Bloomberg's key points: Trump's incompetence, his business failures, hypocrisy, and the contrast with Bloomberg's achievements. Also, the moral framing is about choosing a competent leader over a dangerous one.

I should structure the summary to start with Bloomberg's endorsement, then outline his criticisms of Trump, followed by his self-endorsement and the consequences of electing Trump. Make sure it's concise but covers all the main moral points.
