SUMMARY:

At the Democratic National Convention, Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" compared to Donald Trump. Bloomberg criticized Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president. He highlighted Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy customers, and mocked his business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect. Bloomberg favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, noting that he built his business without a million-dollar check from his father. He warned that a Trump presidency would harm the economy, threaten retirement savings, and erode America's influence worldwide.

END OF SUMMARY.
