SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and billionaire ex-Republican, made a scathing speech against Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg argued that Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a *sane*, *competent* person, unlike Trump, who is a *dangerous*, *disastrous* demagogue. Bloomberg characterized Trump's career as a litany of collapses and missteps, highlighting his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy stockholders, contractors, and customers who feel they've been *cheated* and *ripped off*. Bloomberg also criticized Trump's business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect, accusing him of *hypocrisy*. He emphasized the contrast between their respective business successes, noting that he built his business without a million-dollar handout from his father. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would cause *great damage* to the economy, *threaten* retirement savings, increase debt and unemployment, and make communities *unsafe*. He urged Americans to see through Trump's con and choose Clinton as the *competent*, *sane* leader the country needs.
END OF SUMMARY.
