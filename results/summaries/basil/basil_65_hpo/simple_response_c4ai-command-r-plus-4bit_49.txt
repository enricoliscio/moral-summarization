SUMMARY: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg argued that Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a "sane, competent person," in contrast to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, whom he described as a "dangerous demagogue." Bloomberg, speaking at the Democratic National Convention, criticized Trump's business acumen and character, stating that Trump's career is filled with bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers. Bloomberg, a billionaire himself, highlighted the contrast between their business careers, noting that he built his business without a million-dollar head start from his father. He warned that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the country, damaging the economy, threatening retirement savings, increasing debt and unemployment, and making the nation less safe. Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton underscores the moral choice facing Americans: to choose a competent and sane leader over a dangerous and unstable demagogue. END OF SUMMARY.
