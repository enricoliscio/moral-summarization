SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" in contrast to Donald Trump, whom he labeled a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disappointed customers, and mocked his business prowess, inheritance, ego, and intellect. He argued that Trump's presidency would be disastrous, harming small businesses, the economy, retirement savings, and national security. Bloomberg, who had considered an independent presidential bid, endorsed Clinton, emphasizing the need for a leader who understands business, like himself, who built a business without his father's help and successfully ran America's largest city for 12 years.
