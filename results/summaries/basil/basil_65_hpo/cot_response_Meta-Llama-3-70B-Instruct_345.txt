SUMMARY:
At the Democratic National Convention, Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he labeled a "dangerous demagogue." Bloomberg, a billionaire and former New York mayor, criticized Trump's business record, citing a litany of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and angry stakeholders. He argued that Trump's boasts don't match reality and that his business plan would be a "disaster in the making," causing "damage" to the economy, threatening retirement savings, and making communities "less safe." Bloomberg also mocked Trump's ego, intellect, and hypocrisy, saying "the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy." He favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics to Trump's, saying he built a business without a "million-dollar check from my father." Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would be "dire" for America. END OF SUMMARY.
