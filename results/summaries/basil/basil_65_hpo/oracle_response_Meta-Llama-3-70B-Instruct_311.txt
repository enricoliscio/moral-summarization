SUMMARY: 
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, who he labeled a "dangerous demagogue" and a bad businessman. Bloomberg criticized Trump's career, marked by bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers who feel "ripped off" and "cheated". He accused Trump of "hypocrisy" for claiming great wealth without disclosing his real net worth and refusing to release his tax returns. Bloomberg warned that Trump's presidency would be "disastrous", causing "damage" to the economy, threatening the retirement savings of millions, and leading to greater "debt" and "unemployment". He also predicted that Trump would "erode" America's influence worldwide and make communities "less safe". Bloomberg favorably compared his own business and political achievements to Trump's, highlighting his own success in building a business without inherited wealth. END OF SUMMARY.
