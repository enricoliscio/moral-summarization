SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg financial news, urged Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling her a "sane, competent person" unlike Donald Trump, a "dangerous demagogue" who would be a "disastrous" president. Bloomberg criticized Trump's business record, citing a litany of "collapses" and "missteps", including "bankruptcies", "lawsuits", and "ripped off" customers. He accused Trump of "hypocrisy" for claiming great wealth without disclosing his net worth and tax returns. Bloomberg warned that Trump's presidency would "damage" the economy, "threaten" Americans' retirement savings, and "lead" to greater debt and unemployment. He also ridiculed Trump's statements on immigration, national security, and foreign trade, predicting a Trump presidency would "erode" America's influence and make communities "less safe". Bloomberg argued that Americans who want a great businessperson in the White House should look elsewhere, as Trump's business plan is a "disaster in the making". END OF SUMMARY.
