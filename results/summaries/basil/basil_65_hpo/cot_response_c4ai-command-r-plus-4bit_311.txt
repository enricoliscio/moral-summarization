SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and founder of Bloomberg, made a moral case for voting for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. Bloomberg, a billionaire ex-Republican, argued that Clinton is a "sane, competent person," in contrast to Trump, whom he characterized as a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bad" businessman. Bloomberg ridiculed Trump's business prowess, highlighting his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers. He also criticized Trump's hypocrisy, particularly regarding his wealth and success. Bloomberg warned that a Trump presidency would cause "great damage" to the economy, "threaten" retirement savings, increase debt and unemployment, and "erode" America's global influence and community safety. Bloomberg, a successful businessman and former mayor, emphasized his own achievements, stating that he built his business without a "million-dollar check from [his] father." He concluded that while Americans may want a great businessperson as president, Trump is not that person and would be a disastrous choice. END OF SUMMARY.
