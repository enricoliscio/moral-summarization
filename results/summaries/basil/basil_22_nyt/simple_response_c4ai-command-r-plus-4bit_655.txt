SUMMARY: Catholic leaders are criticizing Representative Paul Ryan for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released by Georgetown University faculty members, they argue that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The letter, sent ahead of Ryan's visit to the university, challenges his misuse of Catholic teaching to justify a budget that undermines support for the vulnerable while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. The criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and assert its political independence. While Ryan defends his budget as promoting independence for the poor, Catholic teaching emphasizes government intervention to address societal issues such as poverty and hunger. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget prioritizing aid to the poor, contradicting Ryan's claims.
