Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article is about Paul Ryan, a Republican, who's being criticized by Catholic leaders for his budget plan. They say his plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, misuses Catholic teachings. Georgetown faculty sent him a letter challenging his use of Catholic doctrine to defend his budget. They argue that his plan reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy instead of Jesus's teachings. They also sent him the Vatican's social doctrine to educate him.

There's also context about Catholic bishops criticizing the Obama administration over birth control mandates, leading to some heated remarks, like comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Faculty at Notre Dame are asking for Bishop Jenky's resignation because of that.

Ryan defends his budget by saying it aligns with Catholic teachings by promoting independence from government assistance. But Georgetown's letter counters that Catholic teaching requires government intervention when communities can't solve problems on their own. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops supports this, opposing Ryan's budget.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key points: Ryan's budget, Catholic criticism, the letters, the context with Obama, Ryan's defense, and the bishops' stance.

Make sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides. Keep it concise but include all main elements without getting too detailed. Avoid jargon, keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Georgetown University faculty and priests recently sent him a letter accusing him of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify a budget that harms the poor, elderly, and sick while benefiting the wealthy. They argue his plan reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy, not Jesus's teachings, and provided him with the Vatican's social doctrine to clarify Catholic principles. Catholic leaders, including bishops critical of the Obama administration over birth control mandates, are using this opportunity to distance the Church from the Republican Party. Ryan defends his budget, stating it promotes independence for the poor, a key Catholic principle. However, Georgetown faculty and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops counter that Catholic teaching requires government intervention to address societal problems. The debate highlights tensions between Catholic social teachings and political ideologies.
