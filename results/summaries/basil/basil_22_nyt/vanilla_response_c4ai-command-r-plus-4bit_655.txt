SUMMARY: Catholic leaders have criticized Republican Representative Paul Ryan's claim that his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. A letter signed by nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty members and priests challenged Ryan's interpretation, arguing that his budget reflects Ayn Rand's values over those of Jesus Christ. The letter, sent ahead of Ryan's visit to Georgetown, included a copy of the Vatican's Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church to deepen his understanding of Catholic social teaching. Catholic leaders aim to distance the church from the Republican Party, emphasizing that aiding the poor is a central tenet of Catholic social teaching. They have also criticized Ryan's assertion that his budget helps the poor by promoting independence from government assistance. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued letters to Congress prioritizing aid to the poor, which Ryan disputed. This exchange highlights the tension between Catholic social doctrine and political ideologies.
