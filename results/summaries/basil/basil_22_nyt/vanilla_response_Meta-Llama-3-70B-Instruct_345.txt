SUMMARY:

Rep. Paul Ryan, Chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University signed a letter challenging Ryan's budget, saying it "decimates food programs for struggling families" and "gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." The letter accuses Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend his budget, which reflects the values of philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are distancing the church from the Republican Party, citing the Vatican's Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's budget has sparked a debate on the role of government in addressing poverty and the values of Catholic social teaching.
