Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the criticism he's facing from Catholic leaders. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about how Paul Ryan, a Republican congressman, is being criticized by Catholic leaders for his budget plan. They say his plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, doesn't align with Catholic teachings. Georgetown faculty members wrote a letter to him, calling his budget plan destructive and more in line with Ayn Rand's philosophy than Jesus's teachings. They even sent him a Vatican document to help him understand Catholic social teaching better.

The pressure on Ryan is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders, who are political independents, liberals, or Democrats, to separate the Church from the Republican Party. Recently, Catholic bishops have been criticizing the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, especially regarding birth control coverage. One bishop, Daniel Jenky, compared Obama to Hitler and Stalin, which caused a stir. Faculty at Notre Dame asked for his resignation.

Ryan defends his budget by saying it's consistent with Catholic teachings because it aims to help the poor become independent. He argues that the Church's preferential option for the poor means helping them escape poverty, not keeping them dependent. But Georgetown's letter counters that Catholic teaching requires the government to help when communities can't solve their problems on their own. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has also urged Congress to prioritize aid to the poor.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects intact. I should highlight the criticism from Georgetown, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the effort to separate the Church from the GOP, the bishops' criticism of Obama, the letter from Notre Dame faculty, Ryan's defense using Catholic teachings, and the bishops' counterarguments.

I should structure it by introducing Ryan and the criticism, then move to the broader context of the Church's stance on political issues, including the bishops' conflict with Obama and the internal pressure on Ryan. Finally, I'll include Ryan's defense and the bishops' response.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, covering all key points without getting too detailed. Also, I must ensure that the moral framing is preserved, emphasizing how Ryan's policies are seen as conflicting with Catholic teachings and the Church's efforts to maintain independence from political parties.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence captures the essence without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Republican Congressman Paul Ryan has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, as they argue it misrepresents Catholic teachings. Georgetown faculty and priests have condemned his plan, calling it destructive and more aligned with Ayn Rand's philosophy than Christian values. This criticism reflects efforts by some Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party, following recent conflicts with the Obama administration over religious freedom, including a bishop's controversial comparison of Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Ryan defends his budget, claiming it aligns with Catholic teachings by promoting independence for the poor. However, Georgetown's letter and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops counter that Catholic social teaching requires government intervention to address systemic issues like poverty and unemployment. END OF SUMMARY.
