SUMMARY:

Republican Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders who argue that it contradicts the moral teachings of the Catholic faith. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter to Ryan, claiming that his budget plan "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." They argue that Ryan's plan reflects the values of Ayn Rand, not the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are distancing the church from the Republican Party, emphasizing that Catholic teaching calls for government to help those in need, particularly in times of economic crisis. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's claim that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching has been rejected by Catholic leaders, who argue that it fails to uphold the preferential option for the poor.
