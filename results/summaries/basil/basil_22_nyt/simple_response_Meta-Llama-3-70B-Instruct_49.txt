SUMMARY:

Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Catholic leaders who argue that it contradicts the moral teachings of the Catholic faith. A letter signed by nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty members and priests accuses Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget that harms the poor and vulnerable. The letter suggests that Ryan's plan reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are speaking out against Ryan's plan to distance the church from the Republican Party and to emphasize the importance of government aid to the poor. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. The criticism highlights the moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable members of society and to promote the common good.
