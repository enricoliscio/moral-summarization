SUMMARY:

Representative Paul Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University sent a letter to Ryan, arguing that his budget plan contradicts Catholic teaching by decimating food programs for struggling families and giving more tax breaks to the wealthy. They claim that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand, not the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's argument that his budget helps the poor by pushing them to become independent of government assistance has been rejected by Catholic leaders, who argue that government should step in to help during economic crises.
