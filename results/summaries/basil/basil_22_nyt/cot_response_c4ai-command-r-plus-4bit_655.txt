SUMMARY: 
Georgetown University faculty members and priests have criticized Representative Paul D. Ryan for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released ahead of Mr. Ryan's visit to the university, they argue that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The letter rebukes Mr. Ryan's misuse of Catholic teaching to justify a plan that weakens protections for the elderly, sick, and struggling families while favoring the wealthy. Catholic leaders, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, have distanced themselves from Mr. Ryan's claims, emphasizing the preferential option for the poor and the need for government aid during times of economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty, and hunger. They assert that Mr. Ryan's budget plan falls short of these moral imperatives. END OF SUMMARY.
