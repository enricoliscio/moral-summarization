Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article about Paul Ryan and the criticism he's receiving from Catholic leaders. I need to make sure I understand the key points of the article first.

The article talks about Rep. Paul Ryan, who's the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee. He's been criticized by some Catholic leaders because he claims his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic teachings. The latest criticism comes from Georgetown faculty and priests, who sent him a letter before his visit there. They argue his budget doesn't align with Catholic teachings and instead reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy.

I also notice that there's a broader context here. Catholic leaders, including bishops, have been criticizing the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, like the contraception mandate. This has led to some heated comments, including a bishop comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin, which caused Notre Dame faculty to push for his resignation.

Ryan's defense is that his budget supports the "preferential option for the poor" by promoting independence from government assistance. However, Georgetown's faculty counters that Catholic teaching supports government intervention when communities can't solve their problems on their own. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has also urged a budget that helps the poor, and Ryan disputes whether their letters represent all bishops.

So, the main points to include in the summary are: Ryan's budget and its inspiration, the criticism from Georgetown, the broader Catholic opposition to Republican policies, the bishops' issues with Obama, and the debate over what Catholic teachings require in terms of budgeting.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Ryan and the criticism, then mention the Georgetown letter, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the broader church efforts to distance from Republicans, the bishops' issues with Obama, and the debate over Catholic teachings on poverty and government role.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point without getting too detailed. Also, I need to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Republican Rep. Paul D. Ryan has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. Georgetown University faculty and priests recently sent a letter challenging Ryan's misuse of Catholic doctrine to justify his budget, which they argue prioritizes tax breaks for the wealthy over aid for the poor. The letter accuses Ryan of reflecting Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than Catholic values. This criticism is part of a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party. Catholic bishops have also been vocal in opposing the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, such as the contraception mandate. Ryan defends his budget as promoting independence for the poor, but Georgetown faculty argue Catholic teachings call for government intervention in addressing systemic issues. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has urged a budget prioritizing aid to the poor, though Ryan disputes whether their letters represent all bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
