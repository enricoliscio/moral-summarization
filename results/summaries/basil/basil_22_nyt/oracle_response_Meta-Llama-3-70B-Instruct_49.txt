SUMMARY:

Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. In a letter, nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University accused Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. They argued that Ryan's budget appears to reflect the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The letter also criticized Ryan's claim that his budget helps the poor by pushing them to become independent of government assistance, citing Catholic teaching that calls for government to step in and help when communities face problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty, and hunger. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued letters calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor.
