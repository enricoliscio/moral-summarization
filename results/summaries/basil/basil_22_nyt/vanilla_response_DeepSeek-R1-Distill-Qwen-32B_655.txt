Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Paul Ryan and some criticism from Catholic leaders. He's the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee. He said his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, was inspired by Catholic teachings. That's causing some pushback.

Okay, Georgetown faculty and priests sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic teachings to defend the budget. They argue his plan harms the poor, elderly, and sick, and benefits the wealthy. They even sent him the Vatican's social doctrine to help him understand better. They want to make it clear the church isn't aligned with the Republican Party.

I remember that earlier, Catholic bishops were criticizing the Obama administration over birth control mandates. Some bishops, like Bishop Jenky, made controversial statements comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Other Catholic leaders are trying to distance the church from the Republicans, using Ryan's budget as an opportunity.

Ryan defends his budget by saying it helps the poor become independent, aligning with Catholic teachings. But Georgetown's letter counters that Catholic teaching requires the government to help when communities can't solve their problems on their own. The bishops' conference supports this, saying their letters represent the collective opinion.

So, the summary should include Ryan's claim, the criticism from Georgetown, the broader context of the church's stance against both Obama and Ryan, and the ongoing debate over Catholic teachings and policy.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, covering each main point briefly.

SUMMARY: Republican Rep. Paul D. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. A letter signed by nearly 90 Georgetown faculty and priests accused Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify a budget that harms the poor, elderly, and sick, while benefiting the wealthy. They sent him the Vaticanâ€™s Compendium of Social Doctrine to clarify Catholic social teaching. The criticism reflects efforts by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party, following earlier condemnations of the Obama administration over religious freedom issues. Ryan defended his budget, arguing it promotes independence for the poor, but Georgetown faculty countered that Catholic teachings require government intervention in economic crises. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also urged a budget prioritizing aid to the poor, though Ryan dismissed their letters as not representing all bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
