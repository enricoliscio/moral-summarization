Alright, I need to summarize this article about Paul Ryan and the criticism he's facing from Catholic leaders. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

So, Paul Ryan, a Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic teachings. But some Catholic leaders are upset, saying he's misusing their teachings. Georgetown faculty wrote a letter criticizing his budget, saying it doesn't align with Catholic values and instead reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy. They even sent him the Vatican's Compendium to educate him.

There's also mention of other Catholic leaders criticizing the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, like the contraception mandate. Bishop Jenky compared Obama to Hitler and Stalin, leading Notre Dame faculty to ask for his resignation.

Ryan defends his budget, saying it's about helping the poor become independent, which he claims is in line with Catholic teachings. The bishops' conference supports this, but Georgetown faculty argue that Catholic teachings call for government intervention when communities can't solve their problems on their own.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Ryan's claim and the criticism from Georgetown. Then mention the broader context of Catholic leaders opposing the Republican Party and the Obama administration's issues. Finally, touch on Ryan's defense and the opposing views from Georgetown and the bishops' conference.

Let me make sure I include all key points without going over the word limit. I'll structure it to flow logically from Ryan's statement, the criticism, the broader Catholic opposition, and the debate over the budget's alignment with teachings.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. Georgetown University faculty and priests recently sent a letter condemning his budget, arguing it reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than Catholic values, and sent him the Vaticanâ€™s Compendium of Social Doctrine to educate him. The criticism highlights efforts by some Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party, following vocal opposition to the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, such as the contraception mandate. Bishop Daniel Jenky's controversial comparison of Obama to Hitler and Stalin has further divided opinions, with Notre Dame faculty calling for his resignation. Ryan defends his budget, stating it promotes independence for the poor, a principle he claims aligns with Catholic teachings. However, Georgetown faculty and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argue Catholic doctrine calls for government intervention to address systemic poverty and inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
