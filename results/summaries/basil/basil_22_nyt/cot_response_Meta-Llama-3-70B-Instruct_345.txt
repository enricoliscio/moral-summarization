SUMMARY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders for misusing Catholic teaching to defend a plan that decimates food programs for struggling families and radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick. They argue that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders, including faculty members at Georgetown and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, have called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor, citing the preferential option for the poor, which emphasizes helping people out of poverty and into independence. Ryan's plan has been condemned for its intolerant approach to the poor, and Catholic leaders are seeking to distance the church from the Republican Party. END OF SUMMARY.
