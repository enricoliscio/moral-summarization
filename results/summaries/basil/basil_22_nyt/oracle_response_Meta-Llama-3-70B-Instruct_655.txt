SUMMARY:

Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Catholic, has been criticized by Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter accusing Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The letter argues that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are pushing back against Ryan's claims, citing the Vatican's Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, which emphasizes the need for government assistance in times of crises, such as economic downturns, high unemployment, endemic poverty, and hunger. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
