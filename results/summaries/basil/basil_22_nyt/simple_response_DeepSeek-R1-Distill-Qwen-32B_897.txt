Alright, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. The user mentioned I'm both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical aspects presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Paul Ryan's budget plan and the criticism from Catholic leaders. Ryan claims his budget is inspired by Catholic teachings, but many are saying he's misusing those teachings. The article also talks about the broader issue of the Catholic Church trying to distance itself from the Republican Party, especially after some bishops criticized the Obama administration over religious freedom issues.

I need to capture the moral arguments on both sides. Ryan's stance is that his plan helps the poor by promoting independence, which he ties to Catholic social teaching. The critics argue that Catholic teachings actually call for government intervention to help those in need, not just encourage self-reliance. There's also the point about the bishops' criticism of Obama, which some within the Church are pushing back against, showing internal divisions.

I should structure the summary to highlight these moral conflicts. Maybe start by stating Ryan's claim and the criticism he's facing. Then mention the broader context of the Church trying to separate from the GOP, including the bishops' issues with Obama. Finally, touch on the opposing views on Catholic teachings regarding poverty and government's role.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include key points: Ryan's budget, the criticism from Georgetown faculty, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the Vatican's teachings, the bishops' stance on Obama, and the debate over what Catholic social teaching actually entails.

Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Let me make sure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too detailed. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, as the user requested.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Catholic Republican, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Georgetown faculty and priests condemned his plan, arguing it reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than Jesus' teachings, and sent him a Vatican text to clarify Catholic social doctrine. Catholic leaders are also distancing the Church from the Republican Party, following criticism of the Obama administration over religious freedom, including a bishop comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Ryan defends his budget as promoting independence for the poor, but critics argue Catholic teachings call for government intervention to address systemic issues like poverty and unemployment. The debate highlights tensions between conservative economic policies and Catholic social justice principles.  
END OF SUMMARY.
