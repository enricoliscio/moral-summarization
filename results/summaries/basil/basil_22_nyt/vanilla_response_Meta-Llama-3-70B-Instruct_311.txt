SUMMARY:

Republican Representative Paul D. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University sent a letter to Ryan, arguing that his budget plan contradicts Catholic values by decimating food programs for struggling families and giving more tax breaks to the wealthy. The letter suggests that Ryan's budget reflects the values of philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's claims that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching have been disputed by Catholic leaders.
