SUMMARY: Catholic leaders have criticized Republican Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, for being at odds with Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University signed a letter ahead of Ryan's visit to the school, challenging his claim that his budget reflects Catholic values. The letter argues that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel and that Catholic teaching calls for government aid to help the poor and vulnerable. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued letters to Congress prioritizing aid to the poor in the budget. Ryan's claim that his budget pushes the poor towards independence is refuted by the Georgetown faculty, who state that Catholic teaching calls for government intervention during economic and social crises. The criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and assert its political independence.
