SUMMARY:
Some Catholic leaders have strongly criticized Representative Paul D. Ryan's claim that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released ahead of Ryan's visit to Georgetown University, faculty members and priests challenged his interpretation of Catholic social doctrine, arguing that his budget plan would harm struggling families and favor the wealthy. They accused him of reflecting the values of Ayn Rand over the Gospel. This incident is part of a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party and assert their political independence. Catholic bishops have also criticized the Obama administration for perceived violations of religious freedom, with some bishops making controversial comparisons to oppressive regimes. The Catholic Church's stance on aiding the poor and the role of government assistance in promoting independence has been a key point of contention. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued letters advocating for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor, contradicting Ryan's claims. END OF SUMMARY.
