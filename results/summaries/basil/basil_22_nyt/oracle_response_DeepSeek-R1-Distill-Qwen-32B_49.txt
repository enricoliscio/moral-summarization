Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Paul Ryan, a Republican, and his budget plan. Some Catholic leaders are criticizing him because he claims his plan is inspired by Catholic teachings. The key points are:

1. Ryan's budget slashes antipoverty programs.
2. Catholic leaders, like those at Georgetown, are criticizing him for misusing Catholic teachings to defend his plan.
3. They argue his plan decimates food programs, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy.
4. They compare his values to Ayn Rand instead of Jesus.
5. The Vatican's Compendium was sent to him to help him understand Catholic social teaching better.
6. There's a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party, especially after criticism of the Obama administration over birth control mandates.
7. Bishop Jenky made controversial comments comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin, leading to calls for his resignation.
8. Ryan defends his budget by saying it helps the poor become independent, citing Catholic teachings.
9. Georgetown faculty counter that Catholic teaching requires government help in crises.
10. The bishops' conference supports aid to the poor, and Ryan disputes their letters, but they stand by them.

Now, I need to summarize this, making sure to include the morally charged words: killed, crashed, misuse, defend, decimates, weakens, gives, violations, intolerant, following, comments, assistance, help, step, crises, unemployment, poverty, hunger, aid.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Ryan's budget and Catholic teachings, the criticism from Georgetown, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the broader church efforts, Bishop Jenky's comments, and the bishops' support for aiding the poor.

I'll start by introducing Ryan and the criticism, then mention the Georgetown letter, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the broader context of church independence, Bishop Jenky's comments, and the bishops' stance. I'll ensure each point uses the moral terms where appropriate.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral framing without being too verbose.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Georgetown faculty and priests recently condemned his plan, stating it "decimates" food programs, "weakens" protections for the elderly and sick, and "gives" tax breaks to the wealthy, arguing it reflects Ayn Rand’s philosophy rather than Catholic values. They sent him the Vatican’s Compendium to clarify Catholic social teaching. This criticism reflects efforts by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party, following disputes over religious freedom under the Obama administration, such as the birth control mandate. Bishop Daniel Jenky’s controversial comments comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin have further highlighted tensions. Ryan defends his budget, claiming it promotes independence for the poor, but Georgetown faculty argue Catholic teaching calls for government "aid" during crises like poverty and unemployment. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also urged a budget prioritizing aid to the poor, countering Ryan’s assertion that their letters do not represent all bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
