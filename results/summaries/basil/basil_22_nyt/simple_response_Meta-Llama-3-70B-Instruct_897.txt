SUMMARY:

Republican Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders who argue that it contradicts the moral teachings of his Catholic faith. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have signed a letter accusing Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget that harms the poor and vulnerable. They argue that Ryan's plan reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and that it fails to prioritize aid to the poor as Catholic social teaching demands. The criticism is part of a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and to emphasize the importance of protecting the poor and vulnerable. By claiming that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching, Ryan is seen as misrepresenting the faith's values and priorities.
