Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article they provided. The user is asking for a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. They also mentioned that I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should make sure to capture the ethical aspects of the story.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Paul Ryan, a Republican congressman, who's been criticized by Catholic leaders for his budget plan that cuts antipoverty programs. He claims his plan is inspired by Catholic teachings, but many are disagreeing. Georgetown faculty sent him a letter criticizing his use of Catholic teachings, saying his budget reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy instead of Jesus's teachings. They also sent him the Vatican's Compendium to educate him.

There's also context about Catholic bishops criticizing the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, particularly the contraception mandate. Some bishops, like Bishop Jenky, made controversial statements comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin, leading to pushback from faculty at Notre Dame.

Ryan argues that his budget aligns with Catholic teachings by promoting independence, but Georgetown faculty and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops counter that Catholic teachings require government intervention to help those in need. Ryan disputes that the bishops' letters represent all bishops, but the conference says they do.

Now, I need to summarize this concisely, focusing on the moral arguments. I should highlight the conflict between Ryan's budget and Catholic teachings, the criticism from Georgetown and the bishops, and the broader context of the church's stance on social issues.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but include all key points. I'll start with Ryan's claim, the criticism from Georgetown, the bishops' role in distancing the church from Republicans, the Obama administration's issues, and the opposing views on Catholic social teachings.

I'll make sure to mention the moral framing, such as the Georgetown letter's argument that Ryan's budget reflects Rand's philosophy, and the bishops' emphasis on aiding the poor through government intervention. Also, note Ryan's counterargument about promoting independence and the bishops' response that their letters represent the collective opinion.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with Ryan's claim, then the criticism, followed by the broader context of the church's political stance, and conclude with the opposing views on Catholic teachings.

Let me draft this, ensuring each point is covered succinctly without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count to make sure it's around 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Georgetown University faculty and priests recently sent him a letter challenging his misuse of Catholic doctrine to justify a budget that weakens protections for the poor, elderly, and sick, while favoring tax breaks for the wealthy. They accused his plan of reflecting Ayn Rand’s philosophy rather than Jesus’ teachings and provided him with the Vatican’s Compendium of Social Doctrine to clarify Catholic social teaching.  

The criticism highlights efforts by some Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party, especially after bishops criticized the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, such as the contraception mandate. Ryan defended his budget, arguing it promotes independence for the poor, a principle he claims aligns with Catholic teachings. However, Georgetown faculty and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops counter that Catholic doctrine calls for government intervention to address systemic poverty and inequality. Ryan disputes the bishops’ letters as not representing all Catholics, but the Conference insists they reflect the collective view.  

END OF SUMMARY.
