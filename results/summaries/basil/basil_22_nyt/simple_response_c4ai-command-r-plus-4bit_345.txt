SUMMARY: Representative Paul D. Ryan, a rising conservative star and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has come under fire from Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In response, nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University signed a letter criticizing Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social doctrine and his budget plan's negative impact on struggling families, the elderly, and the sick. The letter asserts that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. This incident is part of a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party and assert their political independence. Catholic bishops have also criticized the Obama administration for perceived violations of religious freedom. The controversy surrounding Ryan's budget and the Church's stance on poverty assistance highlights the tension between political ideologies and religious moral teachings.

END OF SUMMARY.
