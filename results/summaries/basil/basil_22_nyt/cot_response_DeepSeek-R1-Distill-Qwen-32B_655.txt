Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Paul Ryan and the moral framing around his budget plan from a Catholic perspective. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about how Ryan's budget, which cuts antipoverty programs, is being criticized by Catholic leaders for misusing Catholic teachings. They argue that his budget reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than Jesus' teachings.

For STEP 1, I need to find all the words that carry moral connotations. Let me go through the article again. Words like "excoriated," "inspired," "moral," "slashest," "decimates," "weakens," "misuse," "values," "Gospel," "Compendium," "deepen," "understanding," "arm," "violations," "intolerant," "similar," "path," "Hitler," "Stalin," "opportunity," "consistent," "independent," "preferential," "tenant," "independence," "step," "address," "prioritizes," "collective."

I should list each of these as they are key moral terms in the article.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral words. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Ryan's criticism from Catholic leaders for using their teachings to justify his budget. Then, the Georgetown faculty's letter criticizing his misuse, comparing it to Ayn Rand. The bishops' opposition to Obama's policies, leading to the church distancing itself from Republicans. Ryan's defense using Catholic teachings about helping the poor become independent, and the counterarguments from the bishops and faculty. Finally, the bishops' collective stance against Ryan's budget.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points and moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each part is concise and covers all necessary aspects without exceeding the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Georgetown faculty and priests recently condemned his plan, arguing it reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than Jesus' teachings. They accused him of misusing Catholic doctrine to justify policies that harm the poor, elderly, and sick. Catholic leaders, including bishops, are distancing the church from the Republican Party, as they have also criticized the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, such as birth control mandates. Ryan defends his budget, citing Catholic teachings on helping the poor achieve independence. However, Georgetown faculty and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argue that Catholic teaching calls for government intervention to address economic crises and poverty. Ryan disputes this, but the bishops insist their stance represents the collective church position. END OF SUMMARY.
