SUMMARY:

Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and Catholic, has been criticized by Catholic leaders for misusing Catholic teachings to defend his budget plan, which decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. In a letter, nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University accused Ryan of violating Catholic social teaching, which calls for government to step in and help communities facing problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty, and hunger. The letter argued that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and make it clear that the church is not an arm of the party. Ryan's budget has been condemned by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor.
