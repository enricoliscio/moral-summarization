SUMMARY: Representative Paul Ryan has been criticized by Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released by Georgetown University faculty members, they challenged Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social teaching and argued that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. The letter also criticized Ryan for misusing his religious faith to justify a budget that would harm struggling families and benefit the wealthy. Catholic leaders are seeking to distance the Church from the Republican Party, particularly in light of recent criticisms of the Obama administration by Catholic bishops over religious freedom issues. Ryan has defended his budget, arguing that it promotes independence and helps people escape poverty. However, the Georgetown letter and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops have countered that true Catholic social teaching calls for government aid to the poor and vulnerable.
