SUMMARY: Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan has sparked criticism from Catholic leaders, who argue that it misuses Catholic teachings to justify cuts to antipoverty programs. In a letter released by Georgetown University faculty and priests, they challenge Ryan's claim that his budget reflects Catholic values, stating that it instead aligns with the values of Ayn Rand. The letter further emphasizes the Catholic Church's stance on helping the poor and needy through government intervention during times of economic crises, unemployment, poverty, and hunger. Catholic leaders aim to distance the Church from the Republican Party and assert their independence. They criticize Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social teaching, which prioritizes aiding the poor. This stance is supported by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have sent letters to Congress advocating for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. The article also highlights the criticism of President Obama by some Catholic bishops over alleged violations of religious freedom, drawing heated reactions. Faculty members at Notre Dame have called for the rebuke of Bishop Jenky's extreme comments comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin.
