SUMMARY:

Rep. Paul D. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter accusing Ryan of "misusing" Catholic teaching to "defend" a budget that "decimates" food programs for struggling families, "radically weakens" protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthy. The letter argues that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, have called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor, citing Catholic teaching that government should "step in" to help communities facing "crises" such as economic downturns, high "unemployment", "poverty", and "hunger". Ryan's claims have been met with criticism, with some accusing him of being "intolerant" of religion. END OF SUMMARY.
