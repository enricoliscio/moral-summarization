Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Representative Paul Ryan and his budget plan, which has been criticized by Catholic leaders. They argue that his plan, inspired by Catholic teachings, actually goes against those teachings by cutting programs for the poor and giving tax breaks to the wealthy. The key morally charged words here are "killed," "crashed," "misuse," "defend," "decimates," "weakens," "gives," "violations," "intolerant," "following," "comments," "assistance," "help," "step," "crises," "unemployment," "poverty," "hunger," "aid."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and structured to capture the conflict between Ryan's budget and Catholic teachings, the criticism from Georgetown faculty, the broader context of Catholic leaders distancing themselves from the Republican Party, and the opposing views on Catholic social teaching.

I should start by introducing Ryan and his plan, mention the criticism from Georgetown faculty, include the specific morally framed words in their arguments. Then, touch on the broader context of Catholic leaders opposing the Republican Party, referencing the health insurance mandate and Bishop Jenky's controversial comments. Finally, highlight Ryan's defense of his plan using Catholic teachings and the counterarguments from the bishops.

I need to ensure that each key point is covered succinctly, using the specified moral terms. Let me structure this step by step to make sure nothing is missed and the word count stays within limits.

SUMMARY: Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan, inspired by Catholic teachings, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for its cuts to antipoverty programs. Georgetown faculty and priests condemned Ryan, accusing him of "misusing" Catholic doctrine to "defend" a plan that "decimates" food programs, "weakens" protections for the elderly, and "gives" tax breaks to the wealthy. They argue his budget reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy, not the Gospel. Catholic leaders are distancing the Church from the Republican Party, as bishops have recently criticized the Obama administration over religious freedom violations, such as the birth control mandate. Bishop Daniel Jenky's controversial comments comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin sparked calls for his resignation. Ryan defends his plan, claiming it aligns with Catholic teachings by promoting independence for the poor. However, Georgetown faculty and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argue Catholic teaching calls for government "aid" to address crises like poverty and unemployment. Ryan disputes this, but the bishops insist their letters represent the collective view. END OF SUMMARY.
