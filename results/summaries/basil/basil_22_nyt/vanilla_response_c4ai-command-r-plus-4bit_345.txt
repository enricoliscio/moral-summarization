SUMMARY: Roman Catholic leaders have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's claims that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University signed a letter ahead of Ryan's visit to the school, challenging his interpretation of Catholic social doctrine and stating that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than Jesus Christ. The letter also criticized Ryan's budget for weakening protections for vulnerable populations and giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Catholic leaders aim to clarify that the Catholic Church is not aligned with the Republican Party, especially in light of recent criticisms of the Obama administration's mandate on birth control coverage. Catholic bishops have also issued letters to Congress prioritizing aid to the poor, contradicting Ryan's claims that his budget reflects Catholic values by promoting independence from government assistance.
END OF SUMMARY.
