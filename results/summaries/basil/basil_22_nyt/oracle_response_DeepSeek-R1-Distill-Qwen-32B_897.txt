Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Paul Ryan and criticism from Catholic leaders over his budget plan. The key points are his claim that his budget is inspired by Catholic teachings, the criticism from Georgetown faculty, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the attempt to distance the church from the Republican Party, and the broader context of Catholic leaders criticizing the Obama administration.

I need to include the morally charged words like "killed," "crashed," "misuse," "defend," "decimates," "weakens," "gives," "violations," "intolerant," "following," "comments," "assistance," "help," "step," "crises," "unemployment," "poverty," "hunger," "aid." 

I should structure the summary to highlight Ryan's budget, the criticism, the comparison, and the broader church stance. I'll make sure to mention Georgetown's letter, the Vatican's compendium, and the bishops' criticism of Obama. Also, include Ryan's defense using Catholic teachings and the bishops' response.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key moral points are included without losing the essence.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. A letter signed by nearly 90 Georgetown faculty and priests accused Ryan of "misusing" Catholic doctrine to defend a budget that "decimates" food programs, "weakens" protections for the elderly and sick, and "gives" tax breaks to the wealthy. They compared his plan to Ayn Rand's philosophy, not Jesus Christ, and sent him a copy of the Vatican's Compendium of Social Doctrine to "deepen" his understanding. This effort reflects broader attempts by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party. Last year, bishops criticized the Obama administration for "violations" of religious freedom, with one bishop likening Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Ryan defended his budget as promoting "independence" for the poor, citing Catholic teachings on the "preferential option for the poor." Georgetown faculty countered that Catholic teaching calls for government "assistance" in addressing "crises," "unemployment," "poverty," and "hunger." The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has also urged a budget prioritizing "aid" to the poor, rejecting Ryan's claim that their letters do not represent all bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
