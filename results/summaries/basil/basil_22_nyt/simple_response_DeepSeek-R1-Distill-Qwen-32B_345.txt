Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, so the article is about Paul Ryan and some criticism from Catholic leaders. I should make sure to highlight the moral arguments on both sides.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ryan's budget is being criticized by Georgetown faculty for not aligning with Catholic teachings. They argue his plan hurts the poor and elderly. Ryan defends his stance by saying it's about helping people become independent, which he ties to Catholic teachings.

I also notice that there's a broader context: some Catholic leaders are trying to separate the church from the Republican Party. There's mention of bishops criticizing Obama's policies, which adds to the tension. Ryan's argument is that his budget supports the poor by promoting independence, but the faculty and bishops counter that government aid is necessary.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I should include the key points: Ryan's budget, the criticism from Georgetown, his defense, the broader church stance, and the bishops' criticism of Obama. I should present both sides' moral arguments clearly.

I'll structure the summary by first introducing Ryan and the criticism, then his defense, followed by the broader church efforts to distance from Republicans, and the bishops' stance against Obama. Finally, I'll note the debate over Catholic teachings and Ryan's response.

Let me make sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll need to be concise but thorough in capturing each aspect. Also, I should maintain the moral framing, showing both sides' arguments based on Catholic teachings.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Catholic Republican, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Georgetown faculty and priests recently condemned his plan, arguing it reflects Ayn Rand’s philosophy rather than Jesus’ teachings, and urged him to reconsider. They highlighted how his budget harms the poor, elderly, and sick while benefiting the wealthy. Ryan defends his plan, stating it promotes independence for the poor, a principle he ties to Catholic social teaching. However, Catholic leaders, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, argue that government aid is essential to address systemic poverty. The debate underscores efforts by some Catholic leaders to distinguish the church from the Republican Party, while others have criticized the Obama administration over religious freedom issues. Ryan disputes claims that bishops’ letters represent a unified stance, though the bishops insist they do. The controversy highlights a broader moral divide over how best to serve the poor and uphold Catholic values.  
END OF SUMMARY.
