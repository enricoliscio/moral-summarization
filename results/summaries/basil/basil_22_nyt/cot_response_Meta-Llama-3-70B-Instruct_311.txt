SUMMARY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan has been excoriated by Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. A letter from nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University criticizes Ryan's plan, saying it "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." The letter argues that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are pushing back against the notion that the Catholic Church is an arm of the Republican Party, and are instead advocating for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued letters calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor, contradicting Ryan's claims. END OF SUMMARY.
