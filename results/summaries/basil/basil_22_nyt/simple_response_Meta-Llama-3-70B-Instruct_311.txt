SUMMARY:

Republican Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders who argue that it contradicts the moral teachings of the Catholic faith. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University wrote a letter to Ryan, stating that his budget plan "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." They accused Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend his plan, which they say reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are distancing the church from the Republican Party, emphasizing that the church's teachings prioritize aid to the poor and government intervention in times of economic crisis. Ryan's claims that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching have been rejected by Catholic leaders, who argue that his plan perpetuates poverty and dependency.
