Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Paul Ryan's budget plan being criticized by Catholic leaders. He claims his plan is inspired by Catholic teachings, but they argue it's not. The key points are:

1. Ryan's budget slashes antipoverty programs.
2. Catholic leaders, including Georgetown faculty, criticize him for misusing Catholic teachings.
3. The budget is accused of decimating food programs, weakening protections for the elderly, and giving tax breaks to the wealthy.
4. They compare his views to Ayn Rand instead of Jesus Christ.
5. There's a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party.
6. Bishops have criticized the Obama administration over religious freedom, leading to heated debates.
7. Ryan argues his plan helps the poor become independent, but critics say the church teaches government should help in crises.

I need to include the morally framed words: killed, crashed, misuse, defend, decimates, weakens, gives, violations, intolerant, following, comments, assistance, help, step, crises, unemployment, poverty, hunger, aid.

Let me structure the summary. Start with Ryan's criticism, mention the Georgetown letter, the comparison to Ayn Rand, the broader church effort, the bishops' criticism of Obama, and Ryan's defense versus the church's stance.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Make sure to include the key moral terms without making it too wordy.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring the moral framing is preserved and the words are included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: Representative Paul D. Ryan has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. A letter signed by nearly 90 Georgetown faculty and priests accused Ryan of misusing Catholic doctrine to defend a budget that decimates food programs, weakens protections for the elderly, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. They argued his plan reflects Ayn Rand’s philosophy, not Jesus Christ’s Gospel. This criticism reflects efforts by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party. Recently, bishops have condemned the Obama administration for violating religious freedom, with one bishop likening Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Meanwhile, Ryan defended his budget, stating it promotes independence for the poor, a principle he claims aligns with Catholic teachings. However, Georgetown faculty and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops counter that Catholic teaching calls for government assistance during crises, unemployment, poverty, and hunger, prioritizing aid to the poor. Ryan dismissed these critiques, asserting they do not represent all bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
