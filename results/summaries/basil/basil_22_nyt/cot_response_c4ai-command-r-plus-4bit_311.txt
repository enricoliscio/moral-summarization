SUMMARY:
Some Catholic leaders have excoriated Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, for claiming that his budget plan—which includes cuts to antipoverty programs—is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released ahead of Ryan's visit to Georgetown University, faculty members and priests challenged his interpretation of Catholic social doctrine, arguing that his budget plan reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. The letter is part of a broader effort by Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party and to emphasize its independence, liberalism, and Democratic leanings. They criticized Ryan for misusing Catholic teachings to justify a budget that undermines support for the poor, elderly, and sick while favoring the wealthy. Ryan has defended his budget, claiming it promotes independence and helps people escape poverty. The faculty at Georgetown countered that Catholic doctrine calls for government intervention during economic crises and high unemployment. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called on Congress to prioritize aid to the poor in their budgets. Ryan's claim that the bishops' letters do not represent their collective opinion was refuted by the conference. END OF SUMMARY.
