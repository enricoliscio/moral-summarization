SUMMARY:

Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders who argue that it contradicts the moral teachings of the Catholic faith. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter to Ryan, claiming that his budget "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." They argue that Ryan's plan reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The letter is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and to emphasize that the Catholic faith prioritizes aid to the poor. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued letters calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor, contradicting Ryan's claim that his plan is consistent with Catholic moral teaching.
