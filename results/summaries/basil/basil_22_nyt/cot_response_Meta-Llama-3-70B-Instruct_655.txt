SUMMARY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican and Catholic, has been criticized by Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University accused Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget that decimates food programs for struggling families and radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick. They argued that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic bishops have also spoken out against Ryan's budget, calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's claims that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching have been met with condemnation from Catholic leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
