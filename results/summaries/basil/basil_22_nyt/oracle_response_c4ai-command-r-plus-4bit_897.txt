SUMMARY: Representative Paul D. Ryan has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released by Georgetown University faculty and priests ahead of Ryan's visit to the campus, they challenged his interpretation of Catholic social doctrine, stating that his budget plan "decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few." The letter also rebuked Ryan's claim that his budget promotes independence for the poor, arguing that Catholic teaching calls for government intervention during economic crises, high unemployment, and endemic poverty and hunger. The pressure on Ryan is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and assert its political independence. Catholic bishops have also been vocal critics of the Obama administration's mandate on birth control coverage, with some bishops making controversial comparisons between President Obama and dictators like Hitler and Stalin. The response to Representative Ryan's claims highlights the tension between political ideologies and religious moral teachings, with Catholic leaders advocating for a more nuanced understanding of Catholic social doctrine that prioritizes aid to the poor.
