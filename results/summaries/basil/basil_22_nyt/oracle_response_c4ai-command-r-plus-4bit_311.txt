SUMMARY: Representative Paul Ryan has faced sharp criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released by nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty members and priests, they challenge Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social doctrine and argue that his budget plan reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. The letter further criticizes Ryan for misusing Catholic teaching to defend a plan that weakens protections for the vulnerable and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. The pressure on Ryan is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and assert its independence. Catholic bishops have also been vocal critics of the Obama administration's mandate on birth control coverage, with some bishops making controversial comparisons to Hitler and Stalin. The debate highlights the complex intersection of religion and politics, with Catholic leaders emphasizing the importance of aiding the poor and vulnerable.
END OF SUMMARY.
