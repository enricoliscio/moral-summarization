SUMMARY: Catholic leaders have criticized Republican Representative Paul Ryan's claim that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter, nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty members and priests challenged Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social doctrine ahead of his visit to the university. They argued that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel and that Catholic teaching calls for government aid to address economic crises, unemployment, and poverty. The criticism is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party and assert its political independence. Catholic bishops have also emerged as vocal critics of the Obama administration's mandate on birth control coverage, with some making controversial comparisons to Hitler and Stalin. The budget debate has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to emphasize the Church's stance on aiding the poor and its independence from partisan politics.
