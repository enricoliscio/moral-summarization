SUMMARY: Catholic leaders have criticized Republican Representative Paul Ryan's claims that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released by Georgetown University faculty and priests ahead of Ryan's lecture at the university, they challenged his interpretation of Catholic social doctrine, stating that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. The letter also criticized Ryan's misuse of Catholic teaching to justify a budget that undermines support for the needy and favors tax breaks for the wealthy. The controversy highlights the efforts of Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party and assert their political independence. While Ryan defends his budget as promoting independence for the poor, Catholic teaching emphasizes government intervention to address issues like economic crises and poverty. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called on Congress to prioritize aid to the poor in the budget. The debate underscores the tension between religious values and political agendas, with Catholic leaders advocating for a more nuanced understanding of social doctrine. END OF SUMMARY.
