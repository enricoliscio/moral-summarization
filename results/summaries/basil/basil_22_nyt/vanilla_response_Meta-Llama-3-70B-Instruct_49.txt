SUMMARY:

Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have signed a letter accusing Ryan of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget that harms the poor and vulnerable. The letter argues that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's claims that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching have been rejected by Catholic leaders, who argue that government has a role to play in addressing poverty and economic crises.
