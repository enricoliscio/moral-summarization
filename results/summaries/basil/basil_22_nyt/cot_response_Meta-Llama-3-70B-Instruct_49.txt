SUMMARY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders for misusing Catholic teaching to defend a plan that decimates food programs for struggling families and radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter to Ryan, saying his budget appears to reflect the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, have called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor, citing Catholic moral teaching that emphasizes the preferential option for the poor. Ryan's argument that his budget helps people become independent of government assistance has been rebuked by Catholic leaders, who argue that government must step in to help communities facing problems beyond their means to address.
