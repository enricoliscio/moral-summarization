SUMMARY: Paul Ryan, Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University signed a letter ahead of Ryan's visit to the school, challenging his interpretation of Catholic social doctrine and stating that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. Catholic leaders aim to clarify that the Catholic Church is not affiliated with the Republican Party. In response, Ryan has argued that his budget promotes independence and helps people escape poverty, but critics argue that Catholic teaching calls for government intervention during economic and social crises. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also sent letters to Congress advocating for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. The tension between Ryan's claims and the responses from Catholic leaders highlights the complex intersection of religion and politics in American society.
END OF SUMMARY.
