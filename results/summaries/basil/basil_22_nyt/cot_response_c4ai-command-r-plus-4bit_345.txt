SUMMARY:
Some Catholic leaders have excoriated Republican Representative Paul Ryan for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released ahead of Ryan's visit to Georgetown University, faculty members and priests criticized Ryan's misuse of Catholic teachings to defend his budget plan, which they argue decimates aid for struggling families and weakens protections for the elderly and sick while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest. They assert that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. The criticism is part of an effort by Catholic leaders to distance the Church from the Republican Party and emphasize its independence. Catholic bishops have also emerged as vocal critics of the Obama administration's violations of religious freedom, with one bishop drawing condemnation for comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin. Ryan has faced similar moral criticism from Catholic leaders in the past, with some arguing that his budget fails to prioritize aid to the poor and pushes the poor towards government dependence rather than independence. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has consistently called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
