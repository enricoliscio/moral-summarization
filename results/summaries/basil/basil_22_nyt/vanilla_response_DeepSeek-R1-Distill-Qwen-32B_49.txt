Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the criticism he's facing from Catholic leaders. Let me read through the article again to get a good grasp of the key points.

Okay, the article starts by mentioning that Paul Ryan, a Republican congressman, has been criticized by some Catholic leaders because he said his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, was inspired by Catholic teachings. That's interesting because it's linking religious teachings with a political stance.

Then, it talks about a letter from Georgetown faculty and priests, nearly 90 of them, criticizing Ryan's visit to their university. They're upset because his budget plan slashes food programs, weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy. They even compare his budget to Ayn Rand's philosophy instead of Christian teachings. They sent him a copy of the Vatican's social doctrine to educate him.

The article also mentions that this is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders, who are independent, liberal, or Democrats, to show that the Church isn't aligned with the Republican Party. Previously, bishops were criticizing the Obama administration over religious freedom issues, like the contraception mandate. One bishop even compared Obama to Hitler and Stalin, which caused some faculty at Notre Dame to call for his resignation.

Ryan's budget gives Catholic leaders a chance to distance the Church from the GOP. Ryan defends his plan by saying it aligns with Catholic teachings because it promotes independence from government assistance. But Georgetown's letter counters that by saying Catholic teachings require the government to help when communities can't solve problems on their own. The bishops' conference supports this, saying their letters do represent the collective opinion.

So, the main points are:
1. Ryan's budget plan is criticized by Catholic leaders for not aligning with Church teachings.
2. Georgetown faculty sent a letter challenging his use of Catholic teachings, emphasizing aid to the poor.
3. This is part of a broader effort to separate the Church from the Republican Party.
4. Ryan defends his plan, arguing it promotes independence, but the bishops argue for government intervention to help the poor.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Ryan and the criticism. Then mention the Georgetown letter and its contents. Include the context about the Church's stance against the GOP. Mention the bishops' conference supporting aid to the poor and Ryan's defense. Keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Republican Representative Paul D. Ryan has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming his budget plan, which cuts antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic teachings. Georgetown faculty and priests sent a letter challenging Ryan's use of Catholic doctrine to justify his budget, arguing it prioritizes tax breaks for the wealthy over aid to the poor. This effort aims to distance the Catholic Church from the Republican Party, following recent tensions over religious freedom under the Obama administration. Ryan defends his plan, stating it promotes independence for the poor, but Catholic leaders counter that the Church teaches government should help communities facing economic crises. The bishops' conference has emphasized the need for budgets prioritizing aid to the poor, rebuffing Ryan's claim that their statements don't represent all bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
