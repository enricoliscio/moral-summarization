SUMMARY:
Some Catholic leaders have excoriated Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan, which slashes anti-poverty programs, for misusing Catholic moral teaching to justify his proposals. In a letter released by nearly 90 Georgetown faculty members and priests, they criticized Ryan's claim that his budget reflects Catholic values. They argued that his plan would decimate food programs and weaken protections for the elderly and sick, contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The pressure on Ryan is part of an effort by Catholic independents, liberals, and Democrats to distance the Church from the Republican Party and its values. Catholic leaders emphasize the need for government intervention to help those facing endemic poverty and hunger and to prevent people from becoming dependent on government assistance. They advocate for a preferential option for the poor, radically different from the values of Ayn Rand, whom Ryan admires. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called on Congress to prioritize aid to the poor, contrary to Ryan's claims.
