SUMMARY:

Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been criticized by Roman Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, is inspired by Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter to Ryan, accusing him of misusing Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few. The letter argues that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are distancing the church from the Republican Party, emphasizing that the church is not an arm of the party. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued letters calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Ryan's claims that his budget is consistent with Catholic moral teaching have been rebuked, with critics arguing that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities face problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty, and hunger.
