SUMMARY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, has been excoriated by Roman Catholic leaders who argue it misuses Catholic moral teachings. Nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown University have written a letter challenging Ryan's plan, saying it decimates food programs for struggling families and radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick. They argue that Ryan's values reflect those of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Catholic leaders are distancing the church from the Republican Party, emphasizing the importance of government aid to the poor and vulnerable. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. END OF SUMMARY.
