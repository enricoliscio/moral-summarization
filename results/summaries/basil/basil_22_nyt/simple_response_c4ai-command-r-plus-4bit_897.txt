SUMMARY: Representative Paul D. Ryan has faced criticism from Catholic leaders for claiming that his budget plan, which includes cuts to antipoverty programs, aligns with Catholic moral teachings. In a letter released by Georgetown University faculty members and priests, they challenge Ryan's interpretation of Catholic social teaching, arguing that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the Gospel. They emphasize that Catholic doctrine calls for government intervention to support struggling communities and prioritize aid for the poor. The criticism highlights the efforts of Catholic leaders to distance the church from the Republican Party and assert its political independence. Ryan, however, defends his budget by misinterpreting Catholic teachings, suggesting that helping people become independent of government assistance aligns with Catholic values. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued letters advocating for a budget that prioritizes the poor, refuting Ryan's claim that their views do not represent all bishops. This debate underscores the moral implications of budgetary decisions and the complex interplay between religion and politics. END OF SUMMARY.
