SUMMARY:

In a stark reminder that politicians should always assume they are being recorded, Representative Bruce Braley (D-IA) was forced to apologize after a video surfaced of him making derogatory comments about farmers. At a January fundraiser, Braley warned that a farmer without a law degree could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implying that Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) was unqualified for the position. The video was posted by a conservative political action committee, and Braley's remarks were quickly criticized by Republicans. Braley's apology highlighted his own family's history in Iowa agriculture, but the incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of speaking carelessly. The moral of the story is that politicians must always be mindful of their words, as they can come back to haunt them. In contrast, Republican candidate Joni Ernst is touting her farm roots as a qualification for cutting government spending. END OF SUMMARY.
