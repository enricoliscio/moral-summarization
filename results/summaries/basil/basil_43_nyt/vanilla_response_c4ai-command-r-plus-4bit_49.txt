SUMMARY: Iowa Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley, running for Senate, was caught on tape making disparaging remarks about Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and farmers. In the video, Braley warns that a farmer who never went to law school could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley has since apologized to Grassley and anyone he offended, noting his own family's history in Iowa agriculture. The incident highlights the influence of farmers in Iowa politics, despite their declining numbers. Meanwhile, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst has released an ad appealing to farmers, stating that her experience "castrating hogs" qualifies her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident demonstrates the continued political importance of Iowa's agricultural community.
END OF SUMMARY.
