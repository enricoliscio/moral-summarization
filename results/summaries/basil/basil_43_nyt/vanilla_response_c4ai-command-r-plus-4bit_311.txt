SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Representative Bruce Braley made comments at a January fund-raiser, disparaging Republican Senator Charles Grassley for being a farmer with no law degree. The comments were recorded and released by a conservative PAC, America Rising, leading to criticism from Republicans and an apology from Braley. Braley is running for Senate this year, and the incident highlights the influence of farmers in Iowa politics, with both Braley and his Republican opponent, Joni Ernst, appealing to farmers in their campaigns. Ernst's ad highlights her experience "castrating hogs" as preparation for "cutting pork" in Washington.
END OF SUMMARY.
