SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, has apologized to Sen. Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him making a derogatory comment about a farmer from Iowa becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley's comment, made at a January fund-raiser, was seen as belittling the qualifications of farmers, a powerful force in Iowa. His apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the damage was done. Republicans quickly criticized Braley, with some using the opportunity to appeal to Iowa farmers themselves. Joni Ernst, a Republican Senate primary candidate, even released an ad touting her experience "castrating hogs on an Iowa farm" as qualification to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident serves as a reminder that politicians should always assume the microphone is on, lest they offend others and suffer the consequences.

END OF SUMMARY.
