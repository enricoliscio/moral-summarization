SUMMARY:
Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, learned the hard way that the microphone is always on. He apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him warning that a farmer from Iowa with no law school background could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley's comment was seen as a criticism of Grassley, who could assume the chairmanship if the Republicans take control of the Senate. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but his words were still criticized by other Republicans. In contrast, Joni Ernst, a Republican Senate primary candidate, appealed to Iowa farmers by announcing that she grew up "castrating hogs on an Iowa farm," which she claimed qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident serves as a lesson to politicians to be mindful of their words.

END OF SUMMARY.
