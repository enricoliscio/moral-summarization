Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Bruce Braley, a Democrat, making a mistake during a fundraiser. He criticized a potential Republican chairman without realizing the microphone was on, and it backfired.

First, I should identify the main points: Braley apologized after a video emerged where he criticized Grassley, a Republican senator. The video was released by a conservative group, America Rising, which attacked Democrats. Braley tried to appeal to Iowa farmers by mentioning his farm background, but Grassley is a farmer too, so it's a sensitive issue.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the mistake and the consequences, emphasizing the moral lesson about being cautious with public statements. Also, mention the farm background aspect as it's a key part of the moral framing.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. Let me structure it: start with Braley's mistake, the content of his statement, who he apologized to, the context of Grassley's potential position, the role of America Rising, and the broader implications for politicians and farmers in Iowa.

I should also note that while farmers' influence is declining, they're still significant, adding to the stakes of Braley's comment. Lastly, mention Joni Ernst's ad to show the competitive nature of the race.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, highlighting the lesson learned and the political implications without getting too detailed. Make sure to include all key elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for the Senate, faced backlash after a video surfaced of him criticizing Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican, during a January fundraiser. Braley remarked that a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law" could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Though Braley apologized to Grassley and others, the remarks were seen as politically tone-deaf, especially given Grassley's potential to lead the committee if Republicans win the Senate. The video, released by the conservative group America Rising, highlighted Braley's misstep, which could hurt his campaign in Iowa, where farmers remain a politically influential group. Braley attempted to counter by emphasizing his own farm background, but the incident underscored the risks of speaking without awareness of the political stakes. The situation also reflects the competitive nature of the race, with Republican candidate Joni Ernst emphasizing her farm roots in her campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
