SUMMARY:
Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat, learned the hard way that the microphone is always on. He apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him warning that a farmer from Iowa without a law degree could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley's comment was seen as an attack on Grassley's qualifications and was quickly criticized by Republicans. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the damage was done. In contrast, Republican candidate Joni Ernst appealed to Iowa farmers by announcing that she grew up "castrating hogs on an Iowa farm," which she claimed qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident serves as a lesson to politicians to be mindful of their words, lest they offend powerful constituencies like Iowa farmers. END OF SUMMARY.
