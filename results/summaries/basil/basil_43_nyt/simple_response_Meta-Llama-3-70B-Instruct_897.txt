SUMMARY:

In a cautionary tale about the dangers of unguarded speech, Iowa Democrat Representative Bruce Braley has learned the hard way that the microphone is always on. At a January fundraiser, Braley was caught on video belittling the qualifications of Senator Charles Grassley, a farmer from Iowa, to lead the Judiciary Committee. Braley's condescending remarks sparked outrage, particularly among Iowa's powerful farming community. The video was posted online by a conservative political action committee, prompting swift criticism from Republicans. Braley has since apologized, highlighting his own family's agricultural roots. Meanwhile, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst has sought to capitalize on Braley's gaffe, touting her own farm upbringing as qualification to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident serves as a reminder to politicians to always be mindful of their words, lest they fall victim to the pitfalls of pride and condescension.

END OF SUMMARY.
