SUMMARY:
Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, has apologized for his remarks at a January fund-raiser in Corpus Christi, Tex., where he warned that "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law" could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. His apology came after video footage of his comments was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee. Braley's remarks were criticized by Republicans, who saw them as an attack on farmers, a powerful force in Iowa. In an effort to appeal to Iowa farmers, Braley highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture and his own experience "doing farm jobs and working a grain elevator." Meanwhile, Joni Ernst, a Republican Senate primary candidate, claimed that her experience "castrating hogs on an Iowa farm" qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. Braley's apology acknowledged that his words may have offended some, and he expressed regret for his thoughtless comments. END OF SUMMARY.
