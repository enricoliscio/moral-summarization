SUMMARY:

In a cautionary tale of the dangers of unguarded comments, Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, was forced to apologize after a video emerged of him making disparaging remarks about farmers. At a January fundraiser, Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa without a law degree could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implying that such a person would be unqualified for the role. The video was posted online by a conservative political action committee, and Braley's comments were quickly criticized by Republicans. Braley apologized, citing his own family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the incident serves as a reminder that politicians should always assume the microphone is on. The episode also highlights the importance of appealing to Iowa's powerful farming community, as evidenced by Republican candidate Joni Ernst's ad touting her farm upbringing as qualification to "cut pork" in Washington. 

END OF SUMMARY.
