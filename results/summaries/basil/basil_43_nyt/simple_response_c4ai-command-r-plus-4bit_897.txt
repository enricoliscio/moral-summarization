SUMMARY: Politicians should learn from past mistakes and always assume that the microphone is on. The latest example of this is Representative Bruce Braley, who was caught making derogatory remarks about Senator Charles Grassley, a farmer and lawyer. Braley, who is running for Senate, apologized for his comments but it highlights the importance of being mindful of one's words and the potential consequences. This is especially true in Iowa, where farmers are a powerful force. Braley's opponent, Joni Ernst, has also used her farming background to appeal to voters, showing the importance of respecting and understanding the values of Iowa's agricultural community. It is a moral lesson in humility and respect, and a reminder that politicians should never take voters for granted or assume they are above scrutiny. End of summary. END OF SUMMARY.
