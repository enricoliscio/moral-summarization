Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a political incident involving Bruce Braley, a Democrat running for Senate in Iowa. He made a comment about a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The article mentions that this was caught on video and then released by a conservative PAC, America Rising. Braley apologized, but the Republicans, including Joni Ernst, are using this against him, emphasizing their agricultural backgrounds.

I should focus on the key points: who was involved, what happened, the context of the election, and the reactions. I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Braley's mistake, the context of the Senate race, the impact of the video, his apology, and the Republican response.

I should make sure to include that Braley isn't running against Grassley, but Grassley could become chairman. Also, note the significance of farmers in Iowa politics. The summary should be concise but cover all these aspects without going into too much detail.

Let me draft it: mention the incident, the candidates involved, the apology, the PAC's role, and the Republican counter. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check the word count after writing to ensure it's under 200.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together in a clear and concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Bruce Braley, a Democratic candidate for the Iowa Senate, apologized after a video emerged where he criticized a potential Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, referring to Senator Chuck Grassley as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Though Braley is not running against Grassley, the latter could become chairman if Republicans win the Senate. Braley made the remarks at a January fundraiser, and the video was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising. Braley apologized, acknowledging his family's ties to Iowa agriculture, including his own farm work. Meanwhile, Republican candidate Joni Ernst emphasized her farm background in her campaign, highlighting her qualifications for office. The incident underscores the political significance of Iowa's farming community.  
END OF SUMMARY.
