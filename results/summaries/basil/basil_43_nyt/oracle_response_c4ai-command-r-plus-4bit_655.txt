SUMMARY: Iowa Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley has apologized to Sen. Charles Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after video emerged of him making disparaging remarks about farmers. In the video, Braley warns that a farmer who never went to law school could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, despite the fact that farmers are a powerful force in Iowa politics. The comment was made at a fundraiser in January and was posted online by a conservative PAC. Braley's apology noted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the damage was already done. This incident serves as a reminder to politicians that their words can always come back to haunt them, as the microphone is always on.

END OF SUMMARY.
