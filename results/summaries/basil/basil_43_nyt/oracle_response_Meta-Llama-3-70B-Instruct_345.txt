SUMMARY:

Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, has apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him making a comment that could be seen as belittling farmers. At a January fund-raiser, Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa with no law degree or experience could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implying that Grassley, a farmer from Iowa, is not qualified for the position. The comment sparked outrage among Republicans, who quickly criticized Braley. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the incident serves as a reminder that politicians should be mindful of their words, as the microphone is always on. The episode also underscores the importance of respecting the dignity of all professions, including farming.
