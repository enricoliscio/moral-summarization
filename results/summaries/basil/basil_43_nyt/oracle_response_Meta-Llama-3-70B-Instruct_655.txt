SUMMARY:

In a cautionary tale, Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat, learned the hard way that the microphone is always on. Braley apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him making a condescending remark about a farmer from Iowa potentially becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley's comment was seen as an insult to Iowa farmers, a powerful force in the state. The video was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee, and quickly drew criticism from Republicans. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the damage was done. The incident serves as a reminder to politicians to be mindful of their words, lest they offend others and suffer the consequences. 

END OF SUMMARY.
