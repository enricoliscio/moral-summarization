SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, has apologized for offending Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him making a derogatory comment about a farmer from Iowa potentially becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley's comment was made at a January fund-raiser in Texas, where he was explaining why he should be elected to the Senate instead of his Republican opponent. The video was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee, and quickly drew criticism from Republicans. Braley's apology noted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but his words have still caused offense. Meanwhile, Republican Senate primary candidate Joni Ernst has appealed to Iowa farmers by highlighting her experience growing up on an Iowa farm, saying it qualifies her to "cut pork" in Washington.

END OF SUMMARY.
