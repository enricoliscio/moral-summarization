SUMMARY: Iowa Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley, running for Senate, apologized to Sen. Charles Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after video emerged of him making derogatory comments about farmers. Braley's comments, made at a January fundraiser, were that a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if the Republicans took control of the Senate. The comments offended many in Iowa, a state where farmers are a powerful force. Braley's Republican opponent quickly criticized him for the remarks, and Braley apologized, noting his own family's history with Iowa agriculture. This incident serves as a reminder to politicians that their words can always come back to offend, even in seemingly private settings.
END OF SUMMARY.
