Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing, specifically the word "offended." The user provided an example of a summary, so I should follow that style. The article is about Bruce Braley making a remark that was captured on video, leading to an apology. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Braley, a Democrat, criticized a potential Republican chairman without naming him, but it was Grassley. The mic was on, so it was caught. Braley apologized for offending Grassley and others. The context is the Senate race in Iowa, where farmers are influential. America Rising, a conservative group, released the video. Other Republicans criticized Braley. Braley's background includes farm work, and he apologized, mentioning his family's ties to agriculture. The article also mentions Joni Ernst using her farm background in her campaign.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed word "offended." I'll structure the summary to highlight Braley's mistake, the apology, and the political implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the necessary details without getting too detailed.

I'll start by stating Braley's situation, his remark, the consequence, the apology, and the political context. I'll make sure to mention the conservative group's role and Ernst's ad as context. 

Let me draft it: Braley's remark about a farmer not being suited for the Judiciary Committee chairman role, which was Grassley, was caught on video. He apologized for offending, acknowledging his farm background. The incident highlights the importance of mic awareness in politics and the impact of such remarks on campaigns. The conservative group's role in releasing the video adds to the political tension. Ernst's ad shows how agricultural background is used in campaigns, emphasizing the significance of farming in Iowa politics.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary. Also, ensure that the moral framing with "offended" is clearly present.

Final touches: Make sure the summary starts with Braley's action, the consequence, his apology, and the broader context of Iowa politics and the impact on the campaign. Keep it clear and concise.
