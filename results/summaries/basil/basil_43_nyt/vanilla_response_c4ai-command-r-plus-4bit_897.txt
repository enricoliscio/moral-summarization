SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, running for Senate, apologized to Republican Sen. Charles Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after video emerged of him disparaging Grassley as "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." America Rising, a conservative PAC, posted the footage on YouTube. Braley's comments were made at a January fundraiser in Texas, where he argued for why he should go to the Senate instead of his Republican opponent. Though Grassley does not plan to seek a seventh term in 2016, he could become Judiciary Committee chairman if Republicans take control of the Senate. Braley's apology noted his family's history with Iowa agriculture. In a similar appeal to Iowa farmers, Republican Senate primary candidate Joni Ernst announced in an ad that she grew up "castrating hogs on an Iowa farm." Ernst said this experience would enable her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident highlights how politicians' off-the-cuff remarks can be easily amplified and spread through social media, often with negative consequences.
END OF SUMMARY.
