SUMMARY:

Iowa Democrat Representative Bruce Braley apologized for comments he made at a January fundraiser, where he warned that a farmer from Iowa with no law degree could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The comment was seen as a slight against Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa who could assume the chairmanship if the GOP takes control of the Senate. The footage was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative PAC. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the comment sparked criticism from Republicans. Meanwhile, Republican Senate primary candidate Joni Ernst released an ad touting her farm background, saying it qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident serves as a reminder that politicians should always assume the microphone is on.

END OF SUMMARY.
