SUMMARY:
In a recent incident, yet another politician learned the hard way that microphones are always on. Iowa Democratic Senate candidate Representative Bruce Braley was caught making offensive remarks about Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. Braley apologized to Grassley and anyone else he may have offended, but the damage was done. The incident highlights a lesson that politicians never seem to learn from others' mistakes. In the video, Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa who lacked a legal background could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, indirectly criticizing Grassley. This incident took place amid a decline in the number of farmers in Iowa, a state where they still hold a powerful force. Braley's Republican opponent, Joni Ernst, used her farming background as a qualification for her campaign, stating that it prepared her to "cut pork" in Washington. The conservative political action committee America Rising seized the opportunity to post the footage on YouTube, drawing criticism from other Republicans. Braley's apology acknowledged his family's ties to Iowa agriculture and his own experience in the field. END OF SUMMARY.
