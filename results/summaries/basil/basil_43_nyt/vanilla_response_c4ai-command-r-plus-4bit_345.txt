SUMMARY: Iowa Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for Senate, apologized to Sen. Charles Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video surfaced of him making comments about Grassley's background as a farmer. Braley, speaking at a fundraiser, had warned that a farmer who never went to law school could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a position that Grassley could assume if Republicans take control of the Senate. The video was posted by a conservative PAC, America Rising, and sparked criticism from Republicans, highlighting the influence of farmers in Iowa politics. Braley's apology noted his own family's history in agriculture. This incident reflects the recurring challenge for politicians to avoid making gaffes, as microphones are always on. Another Iowa Senate candidate, Republican Joni Ernst, also used her farming background in an ad to appeal to Iowa farmers, demonstrating the political weight of the farming community in the state.
END OF SUMMARY.
