SUMMARY:

Iowa Democrat Representative Bruce Braley apologized for comments made at a January fundraiser, where he warned that a farmer from Iowa with no law school experience could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The comment was seen as a slight against Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. Braley is running for Senate this year and made the comment to explain why he should be elected instead of his Republican opponent. The footage was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee, and quickly drew criticism from Republicans. Braley apologized, citing his family's history with Iowa agriculture, including his own farm work experience. The incident highlights the importance of being mindful of one's words, as they can be used against them. Meanwhile, Republican Senate primary candidate Joni Ernst is appealing to Iowa farmers by touting her experience castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, saying it qualifies her to "cut pork" in Washington.

END OF SUMMARY.
