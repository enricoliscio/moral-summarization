SUMMARY: Iowa Democrat Representative Bruce Braley made offensive comments about Senator Charles Grassley and farmers in Iowa during a fundraiser, and his remarks were caught on tape. In the video, which was posted online by a conservative PAC, Mr. Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa who is not a lawyer could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This was seen as an insult to Senator Grassley, who could potentially chair the committee if Republicans take control of the Senate. Mr. Braley apologized to Senator Grassley and anyone else he may have offended, noting his own family's history with agriculture. The incident highlights the importance of farmers in Iowa politics, as well as the potential consequences of making offensive remarks that are caught on tape. It also demonstrates the role of PACs in modern politics, as they use opposition research and videos to attack their opponents. Another Iowa politician, Joni Ernst, tried to appeal to farmers in a recent ad by highlighting her own experience with farming.

END OF SUMMARY.
