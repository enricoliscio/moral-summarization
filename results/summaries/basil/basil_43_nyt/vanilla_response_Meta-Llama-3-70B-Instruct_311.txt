SUMMARY:

Iowa Democrat Representative Bruce Braley apologized for comments made at a January fundraiser, where he implied that Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, was unqualified to lead the Judiciary Committee due to his background as a farmer. The comments were caught on video and posted on YouTube by a conservative political action committee. Braley's remarks were criticized by Republicans, and he apologized, citing his own family's history in Iowa agriculture. The incident highlights the importance of being mindful of one's words, as they can be used against them. Meanwhile, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst is appealing to Iowa farmers by touting her own farm background, saying it qualifies her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident is likely to have implications for the Iowa Senate race.

END OF SUMMARY.
