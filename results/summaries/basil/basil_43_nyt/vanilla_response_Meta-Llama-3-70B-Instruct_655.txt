SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, apologized for comments he made at a January fundraiser in Texas. In the video, Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa with no law degree or experience could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, referencing Sen. Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. The video was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee. Braley's comments were criticized by Republicans, and he apologized, citing his family's history with Iowa agriculture. Iowa farmers are a powerful force in the state, which ranks second in total farm sales. Meanwhile, Joni Ernst, a Republican Senate primary candidate, released an ad highlighting her farm upbringing, including castrating hogs, and claimed it qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington.

END OF SUMMARY.
