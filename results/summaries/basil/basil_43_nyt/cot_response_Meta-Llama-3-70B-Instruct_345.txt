SUMMARY:
Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, apologized for his offensive remarks about Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implying that Grassley was unqualified for the position. The video of Braley's comments was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee. Braley's apology noted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but Republicans quickly criticized him for his remarks. In contrast, Joni Ernst, a Republican Senate candidate, highlighted her experience growing up on an Iowa farm, saying it qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. The incident serves as a lesson to politicians that the microphone is always on, and careless comments can have consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
