Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article carefully first.

The article is about Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa, who made a controversial remark during a fundraiser. He criticized a potential Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implying that a farmer without a law background couldn't lead the committee. This was caught on video and released by a conservative group, leading to criticism and an apology from Braley.

I should identify the key points: who, what, when, where, why. Braley is running for Senate, not against Grassley, but Grassley could become chairman if Republicans win the Senate. The video was from a January event, and it was released in June. Braley apologized, mentioning his farm background. Also, there's a mention of another Republican candidate, Joni Ernst, highlighting her farm experience.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by stating the incident, the context, the consequences, and the additional info about the other candidate.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all important aspects and keep it clear and to the point.
