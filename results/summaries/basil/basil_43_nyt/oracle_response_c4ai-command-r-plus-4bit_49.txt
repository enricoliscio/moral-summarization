SUMMARY: A politician's offensive remarks about farmers and lawyers were caught on a hot mic, leading to a public apology. Iowa Democrat Representative Bruce Braley, running for Senate, criticized the idea of a farmer becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offending Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and potentially many others. Braley apologized to Grassley and "anyone I may have offended," acknowledging his own family's history with Iowa agriculture. This incident highlights the importance of politicians being mindful of their words, as a microphone is always on. It also underscores the power of farmers in Iowa politics, with Republican Senate primary candidate Joni Ernst also appealing to farmers in her ad. This story serves as a reminder that offensive remarks made in private can quickly become public, leading to moral outrage and political consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
