SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, apologized for comments made at a January fundraiser in Texas. In the video, Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa with no law degree or experience could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, referencing Sen. Charles E. Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee. The conservative political action committee America Rising posted the footage on YouTube, sparking criticism from Republicans. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, including his own farm work experience. The incident is a reminder that politicians should always assume the microphone is on. Meanwhile, Republican Senate primary candidate Joni Ernst released an ad touting her farm upbringing, including castrating hogs, as a qualification to "cut pork" in Washington.

END OF SUMMARY.
