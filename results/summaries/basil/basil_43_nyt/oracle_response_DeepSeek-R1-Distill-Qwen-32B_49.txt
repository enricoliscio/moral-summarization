Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing, specifically the word "offended." The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications mentioned in the article. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Bruce Braley, a Democrat, who made a remark about a farmer from Iowa potentially becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He later apologized for offending Charles Grassley and others. The article mentions that Braley isn't running against Grassley but Grassley could become chairman if Republicans win the Senate. Braley's remark was made at a fundraiser, and it was released by a conservative group. Farmers are still influential in Iowa, so Braley's apology emphasized his agricultural background. Another candidate, Joni Ernst, used her farm experience in her campaign.

Now, I need to create a concise summary. I should include that Braley apologized for offending, mention the context of the remark, the political implications, and the significance of farmers in Iowa. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the morally framed word "offended."

I'll structure it by stating Braley's apology, the remark's content, the potential political impact, the conservative group's role, the importance of farmers, and Braley's background. I'll also mention Ernst's campaign to highlight the agricultural angle in the race.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures all key points without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Finally, I'll make sure to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat running for Senate in Iowa, apologized after a video surfaced where he criticized a potential Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Charles E. Grassley, by suggesting he was a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley's remarks were made at a January fundraiser and were released by a conservative political action committee. While Braley is not running against Grassley, the Republican could become chairman if his party wins the Senate. Braley apologized to Grassley and "anyone I may have offended," emphasizing his family's agricultural ties and his own farm work experience. The incident highlights the political significance of Iowa's farming community, as Republican candidate Joni Ernst also appealed to farmers by citing her upbringing on an Iowa farm. The situation underscores the risks of off-the-cuff remarks in politics and the enduring influence of agriculture in Iowa.  
END OF SUMMARY.
