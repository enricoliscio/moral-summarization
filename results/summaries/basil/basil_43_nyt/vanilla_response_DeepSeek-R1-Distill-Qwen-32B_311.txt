Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa, who made a mistake during a fundraiser. He criticized a potential Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which could be Senator Grassley. The issue is that he was on a live microphone and his comments were recorded and released by a conservative PAC.

I should note that Braley apologized, mentioning his family's farming background. Also, there's another Republican candidate, Joni Ernst, who's using her farm experience in her campaign. The article mentions that farmers are still influential in Iowa, even though their numbers are decreasing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event: Braley's gaffe. Then mention the context, the PAC releasing the video, the apology, and the relevance of farming in Iowa politics. Also, include Ernst's ad as it's related to the same theme.

I should ensure the summary is concise, capturing all key points without unnecessary details. Make sure to include the main actors, the mistake, the consequences, and the broader context about Iowa farmers in politics.

Let me structure it: Braley's mistake, the content of his remarks, the PAC's role, his apology, the political significance of farmers in Iowa, and Ernst's campaign ad. That should cover all essential elements succinctly.
