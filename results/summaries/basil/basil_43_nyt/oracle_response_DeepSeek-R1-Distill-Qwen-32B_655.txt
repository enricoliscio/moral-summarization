Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing, specifically the word "offended." Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa, who made a remark about a potential Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He said, "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law." This was captured on video and released by a conservative group, America Rising.

Braley apologized to Senator Grassley and anyone he offended. Even though Braley isn't running against Grassley, Grassley could become chairman if Republicans win the Senate. Braley was speaking at a fundraiser, trying to argue why he should be in the Senate instead of his Republican opponent.

Farmers are still a significant group in Iowa, so Braley's comment could be problematic. He apologized, mentioning his own farm background. Meanwhile, Republican candidate Joni Ernst is using her farm experience in her campaign, saying it qualifies her to "cut pork" in Washington.

I need to make sure the summary includes the word "offended" and captures the moral aspect of the situation. I'll focus on Braley's mistake, the apology, and the context of Iowa's agricultural influence. Also, mention Ernst's campaign tactic as it relates to the same audience.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Braley's mistake, the consequence, his apology, and the political implications, including the mention of "offended." I'll also include Ernst's ad to show the broader context of farm background in politics.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically and includes all necessary elements without being too detailed. Double-checking the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, making sure the morally framed word "offended" is included as per the instructions.
