SUMMARY: Iowa Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley was caught making offensive remarks about Sen. Charles Grassley, a farmer, at a fundraiser. Braley, who is running for Senate, warned that a farmer without a law degree could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offending many in Iowa, a state with a strong farming community. Braley apologized to Grassley and anyone else he offended, but the damage was done. The incident highlights the importance of politicians being careful with their words, as a microphone is always on. It also shows the power of farmers in Iowa politics, with both Braley and his Republican opponent, Joni Ernst, appealing to this influential group. Ernst's ad about her hog-farming background is an example of this. The incident demonstrates the potential consequences of insensitive remarks in politics, as well as the enduring influence of farmers in Iowa.
END OF SUMMARY.
