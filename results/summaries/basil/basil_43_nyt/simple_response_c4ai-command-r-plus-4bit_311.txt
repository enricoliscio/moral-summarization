SUMMARY: Politicians should be careful about what they say, as their words can easily come back to haunt them. This is the lesson that Representative Bruce Braley learned the hard way when a video surfaced of him making derogatory comments about Senator Charles E. Grassley, a farmer and lawyer from Iowa. Mr. Braley, a Democrat running for Senate, was speaking at a fundraiser and warned against the prospect of a farmer with no law degree becoming the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The comment backfired as farmers are a powerful force in Iowa, and Mr. Braley was forced to apologize for his insensitive remarks. This incident highlights the importance of respecting and valuing the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our elected officials, and serves as a reminder that words have power and can easily be used against us.
