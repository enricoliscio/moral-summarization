SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Representative Bruce Braley has apologized to Senator Charles Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video surfaced of him making comments about Grassley's background as a farmer and lack of law degree. The video was released by conservative PAC America Rising and showed Braley speaking at a fundraiser in January. Braley is running for Senate this year and his comments were seen as an appeal to Iowa farmers, a powerful force in the state. In response to the video, Braley highlighted his own family's history with agriculture and his work on farm jobs. This is not the first time a politician has been caught making insensitive remarks, as microphones often pick up private conversations or statements not meant for public consumption. Another Iowa Senate candidate, Republican Joni Ernst, has also used her farming background as a campaign appeal, saying it qualifies her to "cut pork" in Washington.
END OF SUMMARY.
