SUMMARY:

In a cautionary tale for politicians, Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat, learned the hard way that the microphone is always on. Braley apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him making a perceived slight against farmers. At a January fund-raiser, Braley warned that a farmer from Iowa without a law degree could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implying that Grassley, a farmer and ranking Republican on the committee, was unqualified for the role. The video was posted on YouTube by America Rising, a conservative political action committee, and sparked criticism from Republicans. Braley's apology highlighted his family's history with Iowa agriculture, but the incident may have offended Iowa farmers, a powerful force in the state. The episode serves as a reminder for politicians to be mindful of their words, lest they offend constituents and suffer the consequences.
