Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa, who made a controversial statement. He was speaking at a fundraiser and criticized someone who's a farmer and hasn't gone to law school, implying they shouldn't be chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The person he's referring to is Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican, but he's not running against him. However, Grassley could become chairman if Republicans take the Senate.

Braley apologized, mentioning his own farm background, which is important because farmers are influential in Iowa. There's also mention of another Republican candidate, Joni Ernst, who is using her farm experience in her campaign.

I should include the key points: Braley's statement, who he was referring to, the context of the Senate race, the apology, the significance of farmers in Iowa, and Ernst's campaign tactic. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
