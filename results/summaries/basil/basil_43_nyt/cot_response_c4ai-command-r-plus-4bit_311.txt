STEP 1:
*Mistakes*
*Apologized*
*Offended*
*Criticized*


SUMMARY: A politician's lesson about always-on microphones was learned the hard way by Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate. He apologized to Senator Charles Grassley and anyone else he may have *offended* after a video surfaced of him making remarks about a farmer's qualifications to chair the Judiciary Committee. The video was posted by a conservative PAC, and Mr. Braley was quickly *criticized* by other Republicans. This incident highlights the power of farmers in Iowa politics, as both Mr. Braley and his Republican opponent, Joni Ernst, have tried to appeal to farmers in their campaigns. Mr. Braley's apology noted his family's agricultural background and his own experience with farm work. Ms. Ernst also emphasized her farming background in an ad, stating that it qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. This incident serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of a politician's unguarded remarks and the ongoing role of agriculture in Iowa politics. END OF SUMMARY.
