SUMMARY: Politicians should be careful about what they say in public, as their words can easily be twisted and used against them. This is the lesson that Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, had to learn the hard way. At a fundraiser, he made comments criticizing Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, for being a farmer who never attended law school. These comments were caught on tape and released to the public, causing Mr. Braley to issue an apology. This incident highlights the importance of being mindful of one's words and actions, especially for those in the public eye. It also draws attention to the moral implications of using such tactics in politics, as it can be seen as an unfair or unjust attack on an opponent. The article also mentions a similar appeal to farmers by Joni Ernst, a Republican Senate candidate, who used her experience on a farm as a qualification for cutting "pork" in Washington. This article serves as a reminder that politicians must be cautious and mindful of their language and actions, as their words can easily be used against them and can have moral implications.
