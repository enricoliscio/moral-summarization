SUMMARY:
Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat, learned the hard way that the microphone is always on. He apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley and "anyone I may have offended" after a video emerged of him warning that a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Braley's comment was seen as an insult to farmers, a powerful force in Iowa. In response, he noted his family's history with Iowa agriculture and his own experience doing farm jobs. Meanwhile, Republican candidate Joni Ernst appealed to Iowa farmers by announcing that she grew up "castrating hogs on an Iowa farm," which she claimed qualified her to "cut pork" in Washington. Braley's apology and Ernst's appeal highlight the importance of respecting the values and experiences of Iowa farmers. END OF SUMMARY.
