Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Bruce Braley and his recent apology. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Braley made a comment about a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He was speaking at a fundraiser, and the mic was on, so the comment got recorded. America Rising, a conservative group, posted it on YouTube, leading to criticism. Braley apologized, mentioning his family's farming background. Meanwhile, Republican candidate Joni Ernst is using her farm experience in her campaign.

I should highlight the moral lesson about being careful with microphones, as the article points out that politicians don't learn from others' mistakes. Also, the contrast between Braley's apology and Ernst's campaign strategy is important. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the summary captures the key points and the moral angle.

Let me structure it: mention Braley's comment, the consequences, his apology, the context of Iowa's farming influence, and Ernst's ad. Keep it concise and ensure the moral lesson is clear.

SUMMARY: Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate, faced backlash after a video surfaced where he criticized a hypothetical Iowa farmer without a law background becoming Judiciary Committee chairman. Braley apologized to Senator Chuck Grassley and others, acknowledging his family's farming roots. Grassley, a Republican, could become chairman if his party wins the Senate. Braley's remarks were made at a fundraiser, highlighting the risk of offhand comments in political contexts. Meanwhile, Republican candidate Joni Ernst emphasized her farm background in her campaign, underscoring the political significance of Iowa's agricultural influence. Braley's mishap serves as a reminder of the consequences of unguarded remarks in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
