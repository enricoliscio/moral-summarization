SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to Democrats offering temporary protections for certain immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall. The proposal was called a compromise by some outlets, but the details revealed it to be more in line with hard-line immigration policies. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for 300,000 people from Central America. However, it also includes measures that would gut asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. The bill would also limit the number of Central American minors who can apply for asylum and make it harder for minors to apply for asylum in the future. Immigration activists and some on the right expressed alarm at the changes to asylum laws. The bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, as it requires 60 votes and Democrats have rejected the proposal, arguing that the government should be reopened before negotiations. The Supreme Court's recent decision to not act on ending DACA further reduces the incentive for Democrats to agree to Trump's offer.
END OF SUMMARY.
