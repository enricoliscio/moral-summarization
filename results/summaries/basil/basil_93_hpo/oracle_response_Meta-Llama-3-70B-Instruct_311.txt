SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent proposal to Democrats, touted as a "compromise" by some outlets, has been revealed to be a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and temporary protected status holders, but is coupled with drastic changes to asylum laws that would gut protections for children and trafficking victims from Central America. The GOP bill would ban asylum for minors who present themselves at ports of entry, expand immigration detention, and impose harsh consequences for frivolous applications. Critics argue that the proposal is not a genuine attempt to reach a deal, but rather a ploy to shift blame. The bill's changes to asylum law have alarmed immigration activists and even some on the right, who see it as an extreme and harmful measure. With the Supreme Court's decision to leave DACA protections in place, Democrats have little incentive to agree to Trump's offer, making the proposal dead on arrival in the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
