Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and they provided specific instructions on how to format it. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's offer to Democrats regarding immigration protections in exchange for border wall funding. He proposed extending DACA and TPS for some immigrants, but the Senate Republicans introduced a bill that includes harsher measures, which might make the offer less appealing to Democrats.

I should note that Democrats rejected the offer before Trump even announced it, arguing it wasn't enough and that the government should reopen first. The GOP bill includes measures that gut asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports, and expand detention. These are "poison pills" that make the bill likely to fail in the Senate.

Frank Sharry from Americaâ€™s Voice criticized the offer as a way to shift blame. The bill also caps asylum applications and imposes stricter penalties for frivolous claims. Some conservatives, like Gabriel Malor, are also concerned. Additionally, the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA keeps protections in place, reducing Democrats' incentive to accept Trump's offer.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should ensure it's clear and captures the key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each main point is included concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension for DACA and TPS protections in exchange for border wall funding, but Senate Republicans introduced a bill incorporating this offer alongside harsher measures, such as banning asylum for Central American minors and gutting existing asylum laws. Democrats rejected the proposal, calling it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. The bill, which includes "poison pills" like stricter asylum rules and expanded detention, is unlikely to pass the Senate. Critics, including immigration advocates and some conservatives, argue the offer is a political maneuver to shift blame rather than reach a deal. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA further reduces Democratic incentive to accept Trump's proposal. END OF SUMMARY.
