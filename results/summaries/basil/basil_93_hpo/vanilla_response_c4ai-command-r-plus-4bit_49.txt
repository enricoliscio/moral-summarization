SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to Democrats, offering temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for his border wall. The proposal was labeled as a compromise by some outlets, but the details revealed it to be more in line with hard-line immigration policies. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for immigrants from certain countries. Democrats rejected the offer, stating it didn't go far enough and that the government should be reopened first. The GOP bill based on Trump's proposal includes measures that would gut asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Immigration activists and some on the right have criticized the bill's extreme changes to asylum laws. The Supreme Court's recent decision to not act on ending DACA also reduces the incentive for Democrats to accept Trump's offer. 

END OF SUMMARY.
