SUMMARY: President Trump's proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall has been met with criticism and rejection by Democrats. The proposal includes a three-year extension for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and temporary protected status for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras. However, the bill also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Immigration activists and experts have criticized the bill as a wish list for immigration hard-liners, with poison pills stuffed into a proposal that is supposed to be a compromise. The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors and limit the number of asylum applications that could be granted, while also expanding the consequences for filing frivolous applications. Trump's efforts to gain Democratic support for the bill have been further challenged by the Supreme Court's inaction on ending DACA, reducing the incentive for Democrats to agree to the proposal. The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, requiring 60 votes to pass.
END OF SUMMARY.
