Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. The article is about Trump's immigration proposal and the reactions to it. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

First, Trump offered a three-year extension for DACA and TPS for some immigrants, which some outlets called a compromise. But when the Senate Republicans released the bill, it turned out to be more of a hard-line proposal, aligning with people like Stephen Miller. Democrats rejected it before it was even announced, saying it didn't go far enough and that the government should reopen first. The bill includes harsh measures like banning asylum for minors at ports, gutting TPS for future cases, expanding detention, and other restrictive policies. Critics, including immigration advocates and even some conservatives, called the bill a poison pill, shifting blame rather than seeking a deal. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA keeps protections in place, making Democrats less inclined to accept Trump's offer.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The article presents Trump's offer as insufficient and harmful, with critics seeing it as a political ploy rather than a genuine compromise. I should highlight the negative aspects and the criticism from both sides.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's offer, its reception, the bill's harsh measures, Democratic rejection, criticism from advocates and conservatives, and the Supreme Court's impact. Make sure to mention the "poison pill" and how it's seen as blame-shifting.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a three-year extension for DACA and TPS, initially seen as a compromise. However, the Senate Republican bill revealed harsh measures, including banning asylum for minors at ports, gutting future TPS, and expanding detention, aligning with hard-line immigration policies. Democrats rejected the offer, deeming it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. Critics, including immigration advocates and conservatives, labeled the bill a "poison pill," aimed at shifting blame rather than seeking a deal. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA maintained protections, reducing pressure on Democrats to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
