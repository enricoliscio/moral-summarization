SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent offer to Democrats to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been met with skepticism. The proposal, unveiled in a Senate Republican bill, would provide a three-year extension for DACA recipients and 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras under the temporary protected status program. However, the bill also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Democrats have rejected the offer, calling it a "wish list for immigration hard-liners" and demanding that the government be reopened before negotiations proceed. The proposal's changes to asylum law have also alarmed immigration activists and some conservatives. The Supreme Court's decision not to act on the administration's effort to end DACA has further reduced the incentive for Democrats to agree to Trump's offer.

END OF SUMMARY.
