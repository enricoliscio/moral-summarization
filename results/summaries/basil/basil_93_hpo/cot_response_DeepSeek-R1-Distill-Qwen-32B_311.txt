Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump's proposal to Democrats regarding immigration protections and border funding. The article mentions that some outlets called it a compromise, but upon closer look, it's more of a wish list for hard-liners.

I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the text again. Words like "compromise," "wish list," "gut," "ban," "asylum," "protections," "dead on arrival," "poison pills," "shift blame," "pathetic," "alarm," "stiff consequences," "frivolous," "incentive." These words carry moral connotations, either positive or negative.

Now, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's offer, the initial positive reception, but then the details show it's not a real compromise. The bill includes harsh measures that make it unlikely to pass. Democrats reject it, and legal challenges add more trouble. The Supreme Court's inaction keeps DACA in place, reducing the incentive for Democrats to agree.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, highlighting the moral framing. Maybe start with Trump's offer, the initial reception, the problematic details, Democratic rejection, the bill's harsh measures, and the legal challenges. Conclude with the Supreme Court's impact.

Let me make sure I include all the key points and the morally charged words without making the summary too long. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Also, I need to present it clearly, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each morally framed word is appropriately included to reflect the author's perspective.

**STEP 1:**  
* Compromise  
* Wish list  
* Gut  
* Ban  
* Asylum

* Incentive  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump proposed a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants, calling it a "compromise." However, the GOP bill revealed harsh measures, including gutting asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, banning asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expanding detention. Critics labeled the proposal a "wish list" for hard-liners, with "poison pills" aimed at shifting blame rather than reaching a deal. The bill also caps asylum applications for Central American minors and imposes stiff consequences for frivolous claims, alarming activists. Democrats rejected the offer, arguing it didn’t go far enough and insisting the government reopen first. Trump’s efforts to win Democratic support faced further trouble as the Supreme Court kept DACA protections in place, reducing incentives for Democrats to agree. END OF SUMMARY.
