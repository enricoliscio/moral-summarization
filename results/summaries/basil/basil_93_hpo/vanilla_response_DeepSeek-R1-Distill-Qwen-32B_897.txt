Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's offer to Democrats regarding immigration protections in exchange for border wall funding. He proposed extending DACA and TPS for some immigrants, but Democrats rejected it because it didn't go far enough and wanted the government reopened first. The GOP bill includes harsher measures against asylum seekers, especially minors, which makes the proposal less of a compromise and more of a hard-line stance. Some critics see this as Trump trying to shift blame rather than negotiate. The bill's extreme changes on asylum are alarming to activists, and the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA keeps protections in place, making Democrats less inclined to accept Trump's offer.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's offer, the extensions he proposed, the Democratic rejection, the GOP bill's harsh measures, the criticism, and the impact of the Supreme Court's decision. I'll make sure to include key details without getting too wordy.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Trump's weekend offer: DACA and TPS extensions.
2. Senate Republicans' bill details: harsher asylum laws, detention expansion.
3. Democratic rejection and reasons.
4. Critics' views on the offer as a blame-shifting tactic.
5. Supreme Court's inaction on DACA affecting the situation.

I should keep each point concise and ensure the summary flows logically. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension for DACA and TPS protections in exchange for border wall funding, but the proposal was rejected as insufficient. Senate Republicans introduced a bill incorporating Trump's offer but included harsh measures like banning asylum for Central American minors, capping asylum applications, and expanding detention. Critics argue the bill is a hard-line stance, not a compromise, and aims to shift blame rather than negotiate. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA kept protections in place, reducing Democrats' incentive to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
