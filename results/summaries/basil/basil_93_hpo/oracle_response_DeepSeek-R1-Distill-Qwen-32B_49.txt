Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Trump's offer to Democrats regarding immigration protections in exchange for border wall funding. The author uses specific morally charged words like "protections," "compromise," "proposal," "gut," "ban," "expand," "stuffed," "shifting," "changes," and "face." I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump offered a three-year extension for DACA and TPS, but the GOP bill includes harsh measures against asylum seekers, especially minors. Democrats rejected the offer, and the bill is unlikely to pass. The author criticizes Trump's offer as a "wish list" for hard-liners and a "poison pill" to shift blame.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's offer and its reception. Then, I'll highlight the GOP bill's provisions, using the moral terms. I should note the Democratic rejection and the bill's challenges. I'll end with the criticism that the offer is more about shifting blame than compromise.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, using the specified moral words to maintain the author's framing. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension for DACA and TPS protections in exchange for border wall funding, initially framed as a "compromise." However, the GOP bill revealed harsh measures, including banning asylum for Central American minors, capping asylum applications, and gutting existing protections for trafficking victims. These changes, described as "poison pills," aimed to appeal to hard-liners like Stephen Miller rather than reach a deal. Democrats rejected the offer, deeming it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. The bill's extreme changes to asylum law, such as permanent ineligibility for frivolous claims, alarmed activists. Trump's efforts to win Democratic support faced further setbacks as the Supreme Court upheld DACA protections. Critics viewed the proposal as a strategy to shift blame rather than compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
