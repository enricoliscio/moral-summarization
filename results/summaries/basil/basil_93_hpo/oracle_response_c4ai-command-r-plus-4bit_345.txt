SUMMARY: President Trump's recent proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall has received mixed responses, with some outlets praising it as a compromise while others view it as a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The proposal includes a three-year extension for the DACA program and temporary protected status for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras. However, Democrats have rejected the offer, arguing that it doesn't go far enough and that the government should be reopened before negotiations. The GOP bill incorporating Trump's proposal includes measures that gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Immigration activists and experts have expressed alarm over the bill's extreme changes to asylum laws and consequences for asylum applicants. The bill faces legal challenges and is unlikely to pass in the Senate, with Democrats finding less incentive to agree to the proposal after the Supreme Court's decision to maintain protections for Dreamers. The administration's attempt to shift blame and portray the offer as a compromise is seen as predictable and pathetic by critics.
END OF SUMMARY.
