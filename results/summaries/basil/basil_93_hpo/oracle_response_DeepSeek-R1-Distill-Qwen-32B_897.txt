Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's offer to Democrats regarding immigration protections in exchange for border wall funding. The initial offer was seen as a compromise, but upon closer look, it's more of a hard-line proposal favored by immigration hard-liners like Stephen Miller. The offer includes extending DACA and TPS for some, but the Senate Republican bill includes harsh measures like banning asylum for minors and gutting existing laws. Democrats rejected the offer, and the bill seems unlikely to pass because of these extreme measures. The author uses words like "protections," "compromise," "proposal," "gut," "ban," etc., which I need to include.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's offer, the initial perception as a compromise, the reality of the harsh measures in the bill, Democratic rejection, and the bill's prospects. I need to keep it under 200 words and use the specified moral words.

Let me start drafting: Trump offered to extend DACA and TPS as a compromise, but the bill includes gutting asylum laws, banning asylum for minors, and expanding detention. Democrats rejected it, and the bill's extreme measures make it unlikely to pass. The author criticizes the offer as a blame-shifting tactic, not a genuine compromise.

Wait, I should include more details. The offer was called a compromise but ended up being a hard-line proposal. The bill includes banning asylum for minors, capping applications, and other measures. Democrats rejected it, and the bill's chances are slim. The author uses terms like "poison pills" and "wish list" for hard-liners.

I think that's the gist. Now, I'll make sure to include all the moral words and keep it concise.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a three-year extension for DACA and TPS as a "compromise" to secure border wall funding, but the Senate GOP bill revealed harsh measures, including banning asylum for Central American minors, gutting existing protections, and expanding detention. Democrats rejected the offer, calling it insufficient and insisting on reopening the government first. The bill's extreme changes, such as capping asylum applications and penalizing frivolous filings, alarmed activists and some conservatives. Critics labeled the proposal a "wish list" for hard-liners, with "poison pills" aimed at shifting blame rather than reaching a deal. The bill's prospects are bleak, especially after the Supreme Court upheld DACA protections, reducing Democratic incentive to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
