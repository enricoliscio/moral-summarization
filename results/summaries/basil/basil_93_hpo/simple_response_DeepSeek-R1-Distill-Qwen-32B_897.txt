Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Trump offering a deal to Democrats involving temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for border wall funding. Some media called it a compromise, but the actual bill from Senate Republicans shows it's more aligned with hardliners like Stephen Miller. The offer includes a three-year DACA extension and TPS for some countries, but Democrats rejected it, saying it's insufficient and the government should reopen first.

The bill also includes harsh measures against asylum seekers, like banning minors from ports of entry, capping asylum applications, and increasing detention. These are seen as "poison pills" making the bill likely to fail. Critics argue it's not a compromise but a way to shift blame. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA keeps protections in place, making Democrats less inclined to accept Trump's offer.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems critical of Trump's offer as not a genuine compromise but a political maneuver. The summary should highlight the offer's insufficiency, the harsh asylum changes, and the political implications.

Let me structure this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main points: the offer, its rejection, the harsh provisions, the criticism, and the impact of the Supreme Court decision.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to Democrats, proposing a three-year extension for DACA and TPS protections in exchange for border wall funding, but the Senate Republican bill revealed harsh measures targeting asylum seekers, including banning minors from applying for asylum at ports of entry and capping applications. Critics argue the proposal is not a compromise but a political ploy, with "poison pills" making it unlikely to pass. Democrats rejected the offer, emphasizing the need for the government to reopen first. The bill's extreme asylum changes, such as permanent ineligibility for frivolous claims, alarmed activists. Trump's efforts were further hampered as the Supreme Court kept DACA protections in place, reducing Democratic incentive to accept his offer. END OF SUMMARY.
