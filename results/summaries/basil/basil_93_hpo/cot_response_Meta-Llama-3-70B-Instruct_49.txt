SUMMARY:
President Trump's offer to Democrats, touted as a "compromise" by some outlets, has been revealed to be a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners like Stephen Miller. The proposal would provide temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the GOP bill incorporating the offer would also include "poison pills" such as gutting existing asylum laws, banning asylum for minors, and expanding immigration detention. These "extreme" changes have been met with alarm from immigration activists and some on the right. Democrats have rejected the offer, calling it "pathetic" and "predictable", and maintaining that the president should reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed. The proposal's chances of passing in the Senate are slim, and the Supreme Court's decision to leave DACA protections in place has given Democrats even less incentive to agree to Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
