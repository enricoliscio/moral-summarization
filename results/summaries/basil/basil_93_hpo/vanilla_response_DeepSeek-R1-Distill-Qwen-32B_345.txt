Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

So, the article is about President Trump offering Democrats a deal to protect some immigrants in exchange for border wall funding. Some media called it a compromise, but the details show it's more of a hard-line approach. The offer includes extending DACA and TPS for three years, but the bill also has harsh measures like gutting asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, banning asylum for minors at ports, and expanding detention. Democrats rejected it, saying it's insufficient and the government should reopen first.

Frank Sharry from Americaâ€™s Voice criticized the proposal as a way to shift blame. The bill would cap asylum applications and penalize frivolous claims, which activists are against. The Supreme Court didn't act on ending DACA, so protections remain, making Democrats less likely to accept Trump's offer.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's offer, the reaction, the bill's harsh measures, Democratic rejection, criticism, and the Supreme Court's inaction affecting the outcome.

Make sure to include key points: compromise label, actual hard-line measures, extensions, asylum changes, Democratic stance, criticism, and DACA's impact.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to extend protections for DACA recipients and TPS holders for three years in exchange for border wall funding, but the Senate Republican bill included harsh measures like gutting asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, banning asylum for minors at ports, and expanding detention. Democrats rejected the offer, deeming it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. Critics, including immigration advocates, called the proposal a "wish list" for hard-liners, with Frank Sharry labeling it a "poison pill" to shift blame. The bill also caps asylum applications and imposes penalties for frivolous claims, drawing criticism from both sides. The Supreme Court's inaction on ending DACA left protections in place, further reducing Democratic incentive to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
