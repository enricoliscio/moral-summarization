SUMMARY: President Trump's recent proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall has been criticized as less of a compromise and more of a wish list for immigration hard-liners. While the offer includes a three-year extension for DACA and Temporary Protected Status recipients, it also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Immigration advocates have called out the proposal as a blame-shifting tactic rather than a genuine attempt at compromise. The accompanying GOP bill includes extreme changes to asylum laws, imposing harsh consequences on minors for frivolous applications and capping the number of Central American minors eligible for asylum. The bill faces legal and moral challenges, with critics arguing that it fails to protect vulnerable immigrants and undermines the integrity of the asylum process. Trump's attempt to garner Democratic support is further challenged by the Supreme Court's inaction on ending DACA, reducing the incentive for Democrats to accept his proposal. 

END OF SUMMARY.
