SUMMARY:

President Trump's proposed deal to Democrats, which includes temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall, has been met with skepticism. The proposal, unveiled in a Senate Republican bill, would provide a three-year extension for DACA recipients and 300,000 people from certain countries under temporary protected status. However, the bill also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Democrats have rejected the offer, calling it a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. Immigration activists and some conservatives have also expressed alarm over the bill's changes to asylum law. The proposal's chances of passing the Senate are slim, especially after the Supreme Court declined to act on the administration's effort to end DACA, leaving protections for Dreamers in place for at least several months.

END OF SUMMARY.
