SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent proposal to Democrats, touted as a "compromise," has been revealed to be a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and 300,000 people under temporary protected status, but also "guts" existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, "bans" asylum for minors at ports of entry, and "expands" immigration detention. Democrats have rejected the proposal, calling it a ploy to "shift blame" rather than a genuine attempt to reach a deal. Immigration advocates have slammed the bill, saying it includes the "most extreme changes" to asylum law they've ever seen. The proposal would "protect" some immigrants, but at the cost of "gutting" protections for others. The move has been met with widespread criticism, with many calling it a pathetic attempt to shift blame rather than find a genuine solution.

END OF SUMMARY.
