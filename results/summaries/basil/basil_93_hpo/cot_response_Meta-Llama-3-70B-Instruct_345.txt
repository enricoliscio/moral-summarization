SUMMARY:
President Trump's latest offer to Democrats on immigration reform has been exposed as a "wish list for immigration hard-liners" rather than a genuine compromise. The proposal, which includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and temporary protected status holders, is tainted by "poison pills" that would gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Critics have denounced the bill as "dead on arrival" in the Senate, with one advocate calling it "the most extreme changes on asylum that I've ever seen." The proposal's true intention seems to be "shifting blame" rather than finding a genuine solution. The move is particularly "pathetic" given the Supreme Court's decision to leave DACA protections in place, giving Democrats little incentive to agree to Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
