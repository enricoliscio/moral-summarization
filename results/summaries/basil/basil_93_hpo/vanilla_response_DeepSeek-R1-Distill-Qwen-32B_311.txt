Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Trump's immigration proposal. I need to make sure I understand the key points. Let me read through the article again.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump offered a deal to Democrats over the weekend, trading temporary protections for some immigrants for border wall funding. Some outlets called it a compromise, but the details in the Senate bill show it's more of a wish list for hard-liners.

The proposal includes a three-year DACA extension and similar for 300,000 others. But Democrats rejected it before Trump even announced it, saying it wasn't enough and the government should reopen first.

The GOP bill has harsh measures: banning asylum for Central American minors, capping asylum applications, and expanding detention. These are "poison pills" making the bill likely to fail.

Frank Sharry and Kerri Talbot criticized the bill as extreme and a way to shift blame. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA keeps protections in place, making Democrats less likely to accept Trump's offer.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on Trump's offer, the Senate bill's harsh measures, Democratic rejection, and the impact of the Supreme Court's decision.

I'll start by stating Trump's offer and its reception. Then mention the bill's tough changes and criticism. Finally, note the Supreme Court's action and its implications.

Let me make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and concise.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump proposed a deal to Democrats, offering a three-year extension of DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants in exchange for border wall funding. While initially framed as a compromise, the Senate Republican bill revealed harsh measures, including banning asylum for Central American minors, capping asylum applications, and expanding detention. Democrats rejected the offer, calling it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. Critics, including immigration advocates, labeled the bill a "wish list" for hard-liners, with extreme changes to asylum laws. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA further weakened the proposal, maintaining protections for Dreamers and reducing Democratic incentive to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
