SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump's proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been met with a divided response. While some outlets praised it as a *positive* move and a *compromise*, others argue it is a wish list for *hard-liners* like White House adviser Stephen Miller. The proposal includes a three-year extension for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and temporary protected status for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras. However, it also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America and ban asylum for minors at ports of entry. *Rejecting* Trump's offer, Democrats maintain that it doesn't go far enough and that the government should be reopened before negotiations. The bill, which incorporates Trump's offer, has been criticized for including *poison pills*, such as gutting asylum laws and *protecting* future cases of temporary protected status. Immigration activists and some on the right have expressed alarm over the bill's *extreme* changes to asylum law, with one activist calling the bill "so *pathetic*." The bill also faces legal challenges and political opposition, making it unlikely to pass in the Senate. With the Supreme Court's recent decision to maintain *protections* for Dreamers, the incentive for Democrats to agree to Trump's offer is further diminished.
