SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent offer to Democrats to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been revealed to be less of a compromise and more of a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The proposal would extend protections for DACA recipients and individuals with temporary protected status, but would also gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Democrats have rejected the offer, citing that it doesn't go far enough and that the government should be reopened before negotiations proceed. The bill's changes to asylum law have alarmed immigration activists and some on the right, and the Supreme Court's decision not to act on the administration's effort to end DACA has given Democrats less incentive to agree to Trump's offer.

END OF SUMMARY.
