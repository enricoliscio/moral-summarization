SUMMARY: 
President Donald Trump's recent proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for his US-Mexico border wall has been met with criticism and labeled as a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. While Trump's offer includes a three-year extension for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and temporary protected status for some, Democrats rejected it as insufficient and demanded the government's reopening before border negotiations. The GOP bill, incorporating Trump's proposal, includes measures that gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Immigration advocates have criticized the bill, calling it an attempt to shift blame and highlighting its extreme changes to asylum laws and frivolous consequences for minors. Troubled by the Supreme Court's inaction on ending DACA, which reduces incentives for Democrats to agree to Trump's offer, the bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate.
