SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed a bill that offers temporary protections for certain immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. While some have praised the proposal as a compromise, others argue that it is a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The bill offers a three-year extension for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and temporary protected status for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras. However, it also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Immigration activists and some on the right have expressed alarm at the bill's extreme changes to asylum laws, which would make it more difficult for minors to seek protection. The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, and Democrats have rejected it, arguing that it does not go far enough to protect immigrants and that the government should be reopened before negotiations. The Supreme Court's recent decision to not act on ending DACA further reduces the incentive for Democrats to agree to the proposal. The bill's offer of temporary protections is overshadowed by measures that would gut existing protections and ban asylum for vulnerable groups, shifting blame and creating predictable and pathetic political theater.
END OF SUMMARY.
