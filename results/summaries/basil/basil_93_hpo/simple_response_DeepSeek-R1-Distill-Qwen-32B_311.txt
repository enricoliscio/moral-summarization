Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, okay, let me read through the article first to get a sense of what's going on. The article is about Trump's offer to Democrats regarding immigration protections in exchange for border wall funding. He's proposing extensions for DACA and TPS, but the bill also includes some harsh measures against asylum seekers, especially minors. Democrats rejected it, and there's criticism from both sides.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The original text uses terms like "wish list for hard-liners," "poison pills," and "shifting blame." These phrases indicate the author's disapproval of Trump's approach. I should include these elements to reflect the moral framing.

The user mentioned I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Let me outline the key points: Trump's offer, the extensions, the harsh asylum changes, Democratic rejection, criticism from advocacy groups, and the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA.

I should start by stating Trump's offer, then mention the extensions. Next, highlight the problematic aspects of the bill, like gutting asylum laws and expanding detention. Then, note the Democratic rejection and the criticism, including the quote about poison pills. Finally, mention the Supreme Court's move and its implications.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the critical tone from the original article. Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence is clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension for DACA and TPS protections in exchange for border wall funding, but the proposal, unveiled in a GOP bill, includes harsh measures like banning asylum for Central American minors, capping asylum applications, and expanding detention. Critics argue the bill is a "wish list" for hard-liners, with "poison pills" aimed at shifting blame rather than compromising. Democrats rejected the offer, calling it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. Immigration advocates condemned the bill as extreme, while the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA left protections in place, reducing pressure on Democrats to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
