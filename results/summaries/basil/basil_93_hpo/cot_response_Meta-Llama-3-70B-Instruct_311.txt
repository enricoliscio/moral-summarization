SUMMARY:
President Trump's latest offer to Democrats on immigration reform has been exposed as a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners, rather than a genuine compromise. The proposal, which includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and temporary protected status holders, is laden with "poison pills" that would gut existing asylum laws and expand immigration detention. The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, cap the number of asylum applications, and impose harsh consequences for frivolous applications. Immigration activists and even some conservatives have denounced the proposal as "extreme" and "pathetic". The offer has been rejected by Democrats, who argue that it doesn't go far enough and that the government should be reopened before negotiations proceed. The Supreme Court's decision to leave DACA protections in place has further reduced the incentive for Democrats to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
