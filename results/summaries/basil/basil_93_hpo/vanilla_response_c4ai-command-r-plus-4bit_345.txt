SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed a deal to Democrats, offering temporary protections for certain immigrants in exchange for funding for his US-Mexico border wall. The proposal has been called a "compromise" by some, but the details reveal it to be more in line with the wishes of hard-line immigration advisers like Stephen Miller. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras. However, the proposal also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims and expand immigration detention. The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors and limit the number of asylum applications granted per year. Immigration activists and some on the right have expressed concern over the changes to asylum laws. The proposal faces further challenges as the Supreme Court has not acted on the administration's effort to end DACA, reducing the incentive for Democrats to agree to the offer.

END OF SUMMARY.
