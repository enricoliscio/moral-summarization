Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

So, President Trump offered a deal to Democrats, extending DACA and TPS for three years. But the Senate Republicans' bill has harsh measures that make it look more like a hard-liner's wish list. Democrats rejected it, saying it's insufficient and the government should reopen first.

The bill guts asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, bans asylum for minors at ports, and expands detention. Critics like Frank Sharry call it a poison pill to shift blame. It also limits asylum applications, which is extreme. The Supreme Court didn't act on ending DACA, so protections remain, making Democrats less likely to accept the offer.

I need to include the morally framed words: protections, compromise, proposal, protects, protected, gut, trafficking, ban, expand, stuffed, shifting, changes, face.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the offer as less of a compromise and more of a hard-line proposal. Mention the extensions but also the harmful changes, like gutting laws and bans. Include the critics' points and the Supreme Court's inaction affecting the outcome.

Make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while keeping the moral perspective intact.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a three-year extension for DACA and TPS, positioning it as a "compromise." However, the Senate Republicans' bill, incorporating Trump's offer, includes harsh measures that align with hard-line immigration policies. The proposal guts asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, bans asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expands detention. Critics argue the bill is a "poison pill," shifting blame rather than seeking a deal. It also limits asylum applications to 50,000 annually and grants only 15,000, alarming activists. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA protections further undermines the offer, leaving Democrats less inclined to accept it. END OF SUMMARY.
