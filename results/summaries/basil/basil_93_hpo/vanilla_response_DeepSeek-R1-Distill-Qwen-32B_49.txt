Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Trump's immigration proposal. Let me read through it carefully.

So, Trump offered a three-year DACA extension and TPS for some countries. But the Senate Republicans' bill includes harsh measures against asylum seekers, especially minors. Democrats rejected it because it's not enough and they want the government reopened first. The bill has "poison pills" that make it unpalatable for Democrats, like banning asylum for minors and limiting asylum numbers. Trump's previous legal challenges on asylum led to this legislative fix. Activists and even some conservatives oppose these changes. The Supreme Court didn't act on ending DACA, so protections remain, making Democrats less likely to accept Trump's offer.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: Trump's offer, the GOP bill's harsh provisions, Democratic rejection, and the political implications.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a three-year extension for DACA and TPS for some immigrants, but Senate Republicans included harsh asylum restrictions in their bill, making it unappealing to Democrats. The bill bans asylum for Central American minors, limits asylum applications, and tightens penalties for frivolous claims. Democrats rejected the offer, calling it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. The bill's extreme measures, seen as "poison pills," aim to shift blame rather than negotiate. Trump's asylum curtailments face legal challenges, prompting this legislative move. The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA keeps protections in place, reducing pressure on Democrats to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
