Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about Trump's offer to Democrats involving DACA and temporary protected status, but the bill also includes harsh asylum restrictions. The author seems critical, calling it a "wish list" for hard-liners and "poison pills" to shift blame. I should highlight that the offer isn't a real compromise but a political move. Also, mention the legal challenges and the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA, which weakens Trump's position. Keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants, but the GOP bill attached harsh asylum restrictions, making the offer less of a compromise and more a wishlist for hard-liners. Critics argue the bill includes "poison pills" to shift blame, as it bans asylum for Central American minors, limits asylum applications, and expands detention. Immigration advocates and even some conservatives oppose these measures. The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, especially after the Supreme Court left DACA protections intact, reducing Democratic incentive to accept Trump's offer. END OF SUMMARY.
