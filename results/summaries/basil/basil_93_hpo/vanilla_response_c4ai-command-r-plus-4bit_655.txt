SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for his border wall, which was rejected by Democrats. The offer included a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for 300,000 people from Central America. A bill unveiled by Senate Republicans, incorporating Trump's offer, includes measures that favor immigration hard-liners, such as gutting asylum laws for children and trafficking victims and expanding immigration detention. The bill would also ban asylum for Central American minors and limit the number of asylum applications. Immigration activists and some on the right have expressed concern over the bill's changes to asylum laws. The Supreme Court's decision to not act on ending DACA further reduces incentives for Democrats to agree to Trump's offer.
