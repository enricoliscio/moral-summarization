Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the steps as per their instructions.

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the context and identify the key points. The article talks about Trump's proposal to Democrats, offering temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for border wall funding. It mentions that some outlets called this a "compromise," but the actual proposal was more aligned with hard-line immigration policies. 

Next, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation in the context. I'll go through the article again and pick out words like "compromise," "wish list," "poison pills," "dead on arrival," "gut," "ban," "curtail," "frivolous," "alarm," "extreme," "shift," "blame," "pathetic," "incentive," "protections." I should list each of these with an asterisk as per the user's instruction.

After that, I need to write a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. The summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: Trump's offer, the Senate's bill, the harsh measures, Democratic rejection, legal challenges, and the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral aspects without getting too bogged down in details. I'll make sure to mention the key elements like the three-year extensions, the harsh asylum laws, the GOP bill's provisions, and the reactions from advocacy groups and the Supreme Court.

I need to be careful to preserve the moral framing, so words like "compromise," "wish list," "poison pills," and "extreme" should be included to reflect the critical perspective presented in the article. I'll also note the Democrats' rejection and the legal challenges to show the opposition and the challenges the proposal faces.

Finally, I'll wrap up the summary by mentioning the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on DACA, which gives Democrats less incentive to accept Trump's offer. This ties back to the moral framing by showing the ongoing conflict and the lack of progress in reaching a compromise.

I think that covers all the steps. Now, I'll structure the response with the identified words first and then the summary, making sure to follow the formatting instructions provided.

**SUMMARY:**  

President Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants in exchange for border wall funding, but the proposal was criticized as a "wish list" for hard-liners. Senate Republicans introduced a bill incorporating Trump's offer, but it included harsh measures like banning asylum for Central American minors, capping asylum applications, and expanding detention. Democrats rejected the plan, calling it insufficient and insisting the government reopen first. Immigration advocates condemned the bill as "poison pills" designed to shift blame rather than reach a deal. The bill also faced legal challenges and criticism for its "extreme" changes to asylum laws. Trump's efforts to win Democratic support were further complicated by the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA, leaving protections for Dreamers intact and reducing Democrats' incentive to accept his offer.
