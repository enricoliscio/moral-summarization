SUMMARY:
President Trump's recent offer to Democrats, touted as a "compromise" by some outlets, has been revealed to be a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. The proposal would provide temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the bill would also gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Immigration advocates have slammed the proposal, calling it "pathetic" and "predictable". The bill's changes to asylum law have been deemed "extreme" by experts. Democrats have rejected the offer, maintaining that it doesn't go far enough and that the president should reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed. The proposal's chances of passing in the Senate appear slim, with even some on the right criticizing its provisions. END OF SUMMARY.
