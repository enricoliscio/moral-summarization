SUMMARY:
President Trump's proposal to exchange temporary protections for some immigrants for funding for a border wall has received *positive* coverage by some outlets as a *compromise*. However, the latest details of the proposal, unveiled by Senate Republicans in a bill, reveal it to be more of a *wish list* for immigration *hard-liners*. The bill includes measures that gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors, and limit temporary protected status. Democrats have *rejected* the offer, arguing that it does not go far enough and that the government ought to be reopened before border negotiations. Immigration activists and experts are *alarmed* by the bill's *extreme changes* to asylum law. The bill faces further *trouble* as the Supreme Court has not acted on the administration's effort to end DACA, reducing Democratic incentive to agree to the proposal. The proposal appears to be an attempt by Trump to shift blame rather than reach a deal, with its *poison pills* and limited protections.
END OF SUMMARY.
