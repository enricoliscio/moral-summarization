SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been exposed as a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The offer, which includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras, is coupled with measures that gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. These "poison pills" are designed to shift blame rather than reach a genuine compromise. The proposal's changes to asylum law are extreme, including capping the number of asylum applications and imposing harsh consequences for frivolous applications. The move has been met with criticism from immigration activists and some on the right, who see it as a attempt to curtail the asylum process. With the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA, Democrats have little incentive to agree to Trump's offer, which appears more like a attempt to shift blame than a genuine compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
