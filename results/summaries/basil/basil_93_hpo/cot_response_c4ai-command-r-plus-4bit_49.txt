SUMMARY:
President Trump's proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall has been met with *rejection* by Democrats, who view it as insufficient and morally questionable. The proposal, unveiled by Senate Republicans, includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for immigrants from select countries. However, it also contains measures that would gut asylum laws for *minors* and trafficking victims, ban asylum for those presenting themselves at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. Critics argue that these *poison pills* undermine any compromise and cater to immigration *hard-liners*. The bill proposes *extreme changes* to asylum laws, with stiff consequences for *frivolous* applications, including permanent *ineligibility* for future *protections*. These measures have drawn criticism from both immigration activists and some conservatives. The proposal faces further *trouble* as the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA leaves Dreamers with continued *protections*, reducing Democratic *incentive* to accept Trump's offer.
