SUMMARY: President Trump offered a compromise to Democrats, proposing temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for 300,000 people from certain countries. However, Democrats rejected the offer as insufficient, and the GOP bill incorporating the proposal includes measures that favor immigration hard-liners. The bill would gut asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. It also includes drastic changes to asylum laws, alarming immigration activists and some conservatives. The Supreme Court's recent inaction on ending DACA further reduces the incentive for Democrats to accept Trump's proposal. The bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, requiring at least 60 votes.
END OF SUMMARY.
