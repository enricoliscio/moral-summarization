SUMMARY: President Trump's proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants for funding for his border wall was initially praised as a compromise. However, the details of the proposal, unveiled in a bill by Senate Republicans, reveal it to be more aligned with the wishes of immigration hard-liners. The bill includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants, but it also guts existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, bans asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expands immigration detention. Immigration activists and some on the right have expressed alarm at the bill's extreme changes to asylum law and the consequences for minors filing asylum applications. The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate and is unlikely to garner the necessary 60 votes for passage. The Supreme Court's recent decision to not act on ending DACA further reduces the incentive for Democrats to agree to Trump's proposal. The proposal has been criticized as a blame-shifting tactic rather than a genuine attempt at compromise.

END OF SUMMARY.
