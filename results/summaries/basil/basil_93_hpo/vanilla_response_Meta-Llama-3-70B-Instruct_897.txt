SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent offer to Democrats to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall has been met with criticism. The proposal, unveiled in a Senate Republican bill, includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and temporary protected status holders, but also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Democrats have rejected the offer, calling it a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. The bill's changes to asylum law have alarmed immigration activists and some on the right. The Supreme Court's decision not to act on the administration's effort to end DACA has also given Democrats less incentive to agree to Trump's offer. The bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, requiring at least 60 votes.

END OF SUMMARY.
