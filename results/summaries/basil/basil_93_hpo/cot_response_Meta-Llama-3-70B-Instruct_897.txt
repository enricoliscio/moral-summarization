SUMMARY:
President Trump's recent offer to Democrats, touted as a "compromise" by some outlets, has been revealed to be a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. The proposal would provide temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the bill would also gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention, making it a "poison pill" for Democrats. The move has been criticized as an attempt to "shift blame" rather than reach a genuine deal. Immigration activists have condemned the bill's "extreme" changes to asylum law, which would lead to "stiffer consequences" for minors who apply for asylum. The proposal's chances of passing in the Senate appear slim, with Democrats rejecting the offer and the Supreme Court's decision to leave DACA protections in place giving them less incentive to negotiate. END OF SUMMARY.
