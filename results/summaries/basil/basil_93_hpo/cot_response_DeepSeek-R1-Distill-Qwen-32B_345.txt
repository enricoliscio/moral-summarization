Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a detailed article about Trump's immigration proposal and the reactions to it. 

First, I should understand the task. They want me to identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "compromise," "wish list," "hard-liners," "gut," "ban," "dead on arrival," "poison pills," "shift," "blame," "pathetic," "alarm," "extreme," "frivolous," "ineligibility," "stiff consequences," "alarm," "extreme," "frivolous," "ineligibility," "stiff consequences," "alarm," "extreme," "frivolous," "ineligibility," "stiff consequences," "alarm," "extreme," "frivolous," "ineligibility," "stiff consequences." I think I might have missed some, but I'll go through the article again to make sure.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, highlighting the key points while using the morally charged words. The main points are Trump's offer, the Republican bill's harsh measures, Democratic rejection, legal challenges, and the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA.

I should start by mentioning Trump's offer as a compromise, but then note that the bill is more of a wish list for hard-liners. Include how the bill guts asylum laws, bans asylum for minors, and expands detention. Mention the Democratic rejection and the bill's likely failure. Add the reactions from activists and the Supreme Court's decision affecting DACA. Conclude by emphasizing the political strategy and its moral implications.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. Let me piece it together, ensuring all the key moral words are included without making it too verbose.

**STEP 1:**  
* Compromise  
* Wish list  
* Hard-liners  
* Gut  
* Ban  
* Dead on arrival  
* Poison pills  
* Shift  
* Blame  
* Pathetic  
* Alarm  
* Extreme  
* Frivolous  
* Ineligibility  
* Stiff consequences  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump offered a "compromise" to Democrats, proposing a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants, but the Republican bill incorporating his offer includes harsh measures like banning asylum for Central American minors, gutting asylum laws, and expanding detention. Critics, including immigration advocates and some conservatives, called the proposal a "wish list" for hard-liners and "poison pills" designed to shift blame rather than reach a deal. Democrats rejected the offer, citing its inadequacy and demanding the government reopen first. The bill's extreme changes to asylum, including permanent ineligibility for frivolous applications, alarmed activists. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's inaction on DACA left protections in place, further undermining Trump's efforts. The proposal, seen as a political strategy, faces likely failure in the Senate.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
