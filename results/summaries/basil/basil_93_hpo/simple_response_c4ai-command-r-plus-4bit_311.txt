SUMMARY: President Trump's recent proposal to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall has been criticized by Democrats and immigration advocates as a non-compromise and a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The proposal includes a three-year extension for DACA and temporary protected status for some immigrants from Central America, but it also includes measures that would gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, ban asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expand immigration detention. The bill, which will be voted on by Senate Republicans this week, includes extreme changes to asylum laws and faces legal and moral challenges. Immigration activists and some on the right have expressed alarm over the bill's implications, and the Supreme Court's recent decision to not act on ending DACA has reduced the incentive for Democrats to agree to Trump's proposal. The proposal has been criticized as a pathetic attempt to shift blame rather than a genuine effort to reach a compromise.
END OF SUMMARY.
