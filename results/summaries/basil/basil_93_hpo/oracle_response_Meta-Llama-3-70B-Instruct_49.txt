SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent proposal to Democrats, touted as a "compromise" by some outlets, has been revealed to be a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. The offer includes a three-year extension for DACA recipients and temporary protected status holders, but comes with significant strings attached. The GOP bill incorporates measures that would "gut" existing asylum laws, "ban" asylum for Central American minors, and "expand" immigration detention. These "poison pills" have led critics to accuse Trump of trying to "shift blame" rather than genuinely negotiate. The bill's changes to asylum law have been called the "most extreme" seen, with minors facing "stiffer consequences" for filing frivolous applications. The proposal's true intentions have been exposed, and Democrats have little incentive to agree to it, especially after the Supreme Court's decision to leave DACA protections in place. END OF SUMMARY.
