SUMMARY:

President Trump's proposed deal to Democrats, which offers temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall, has been revealed to include several measures that are unfavorable to Democrats and immigration advocates. The deal would extend protections for DACA recipients and individuals with temporary protected status, but would also gut existing asylum laws, ban asylum for Central American minors, and expand immigration detention. Democrats have rejected the offer, citing that it doesn't go far enough and that the government should be reopened before negotiations proceed. Immigration advocates have also criticized the proposal, calling it a "wish list" for immigration hard-liners. The Supreme Court's decision not to act on the administration's effort to end DACA has also reduced the incentive for Democrats to agree to Trump's offer.

END OF SUMMARY.
