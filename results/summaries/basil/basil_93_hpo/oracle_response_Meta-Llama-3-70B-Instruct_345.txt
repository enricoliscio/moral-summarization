SUMMARY:

President Trump's offer to Democrats, touted as a "compromise" by some outlets, has been revealed to be a wish list for immigration hard-liners. The proposal would provide temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the GOP bill incorporating the offer would also "gut" existing asylum laws, "ban" asylum for minors, and "expand" immigration detention. These measures would make it more likely to be "dead on arrival" in the Senate. Critics argue that the proposal is not a genuine attempt to reach a deal, but rather an effort to "shift blame". The bill's changes to asylum law have alarmed immigration activists, who see it as an attempt to "gut" protections for vulnerable groups, including children and trafficking victims. Democrats have rejected the offer, maintaining that it doesn't go far enough and that the president should reopen the government before negotiations proceed. END OF SUMMARY.
