Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me go through the article step by step.

First, the article talks about Trump's offer to Democrats, which was initially seen as a compromise. But upon closer look, it's more of a wish list for hard-liners. I should use "protections" and "compromise" here.

Next, the proposal includes extensions for DACA and TPS, but it also guts asylum laws. Words like "gut," "ban," and "expand" are important to include. I need to highlight how the bill affects minors and trafficking victims.

The bill's harsh measures, like banning asylum for minors and capping applications, are part of the administration's effort to reduce asylum seekers. This shows a shift in blame, using "stuff" and "shifting."

The Supreme Court's inaction on DACA adds pressure, making Democrats less inclined to accept Trump's offer. I should mention "face" as it relates to consequences for filing frivolous claims.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while including all the key moral terms. Let me structure it to first present Trump's offer, then the problematic aspects of the bill, and finally the political implications.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension for DACA and TPS protections, initially framed as a "compromise." However, the GOP bill revealed on Monday included harsh measures like gutting asylum laws for children and trafficking victims, banning asylum for minors at ports of entry, and expanding immigration detention. These changes made the proposal appear less like a compromise and more like a wish list for immigration hard-liners. Democrats rejected the offer, arguing it didn’t go far enough and demanding the government reopen first. The bill also caps asylum applications for Central American minors at 50,000 annually and limits approvals to 15,000, facing criticism as the most extreme changes to asylum laws ever seen. Immigration activists and even some conservatives condemned the proposal, calling it a "poison pill" to shift blame. Trump’s efforts to win Democratic support were further derailed as the Supreme Court left DACA protections in place, reducing incentives for Democrats to accept his offer. END OF SUMMARY.
