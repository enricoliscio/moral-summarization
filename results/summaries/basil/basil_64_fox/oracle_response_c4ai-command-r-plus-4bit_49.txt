SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense backlash and calls to resign after openly criticizing Donald Trump, deeming him a "faker" and unqualified for the presidency. Her comments were deemed inappropriate and a breach of the expected political neutrality of a Supreme Court Justice. Ginsburg's remarks sparked bipartisan criticism, with many deeming them "inappropriate," "biased," and undermining the impartiality of the courts. Trump himself called for her resignation, stating that she had embarrassed the court with her "dumb political statements." Despite the backlash, Ginsburg stood by her comments, highlighting Trump's inconsistency and ego. The situation raised questions about the appropriate boundaries of political expression for members of the Supreme Court, with some defending Ginsburg's right to free speech and others arguing that her comments breached the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges.
