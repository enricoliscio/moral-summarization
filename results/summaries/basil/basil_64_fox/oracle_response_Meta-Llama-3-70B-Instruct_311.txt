SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Many, including Trump himself, deemed her comments "inappropriate" and "biased", arguing that a Supreme Court justice should remain "objective" and not "involved" in a political campaign. Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying Ginsburg's mind is "shot" and she should "resign". Even Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media outlets, such as The Washington Post and The New York Times, criticized her comments, warning that they could "undermine" public faith in the impartiality of the courts. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support for her comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who "lies" frequently. The controversy highlights the importance of judges remaining impartial and not "endorsing" or "opposing" candidates for public office.
