Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg facing backlash for her comments about Donald Trump. She called him a "faker" and criticized his qualifications. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included in the summary. I should make sure to incorporate as many of these as possible without making the summary too long.

I should start by identifying the main events: Ginsburg's initial comments, her doubling down, the reactions from Trump, Republican leaders, Democrats, and the media. Each of these reactions uses moral terms, so I need to capture that in the summary.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning Ginsburg's comments, the backlash from Trump, the Republican leaders, Democrats, and the media, then mention the support from Bernie Sanders. I should use the moral words like "faker," "inappropriate," "objective," "biased," "undermines," etc., where they fit naturally.

I should also check that the summary flows well and covers all the key points without being too detailed. I'll make sure to include the main reactions and the implications for the Supreme Court's impartiality. Finally, I'll end with Bernie Sanders' support to show some backing despite the backlash.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary moral terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll review it to ensure clarity and that it accurately reflects the original article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan criticism after calling Donald Trump a "faker" and questioning his qualifications for the presidency. Her comments were deemed "inappropriate" and "biased," undermining public faith in the court's impartiality. Trump criticized her for being "involved" in politics, while Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan accused her of lacking "objectivity." Democratic lawmakers also expressed discomfort, though some acknowledged her right to hold political views. Media outlets criticized her for "endorsing" or "opposing" a candidate, violating the Code of Conduct for judges. Ginsburg defended her remarks, describing Trump as "unqualified" and "egotistical." While some, like Bernie Sanders, supported her stance, the backlash highlighted concerns about the court's "partisan" image and the need for justices to remain neutral. END OF SUMMARY.
