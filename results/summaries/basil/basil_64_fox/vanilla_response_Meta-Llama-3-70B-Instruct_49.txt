SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced backlash from both parties after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications to be president. Trump responded by calling for her resignation, saying her comments were "dumb" and "embarrassing." Many politicians and media outlets agreed that Ginsburg's comments were inappropriate, citing concerns about the impartiality of the Supreme Court. Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, as well as Democratic lawmakers Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin, criticized Ginsburg's comments. The Washington Post and The New York Times also editorialized that her remarks were out of line. However, Bernie Sanders gave qualified support to Ginsburg's comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who lies frequently.
