SUMMARY: 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Supreme Court Justice, faced bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified to be president. Trump lashed out on Twitter, calling for her resignation and stating that her mind is "shot". Ginsburg's comments were deemed "inappropriate" and "out of line" by political figures and media outlets, as they undermined the perceived impartiality of the courts and raised skepticism about the objectivity of the Supreme Court. Ginsburg's comments left Democratic lawmakers squirming, with some suggesting she went "over her skies" and was too forthright with her political views. Mainstream media outlets also criticized Ginsburg, stating that her comments were valid but "much, much better left unsaid". The Code of Conduct for U.S. judges states that judges should not publicly oppose political candidates. While Ginsburg received some qualified support from Bernie Sanders, who called Trump an "opportunist" and a "liar", the backlash highlights the delicate balance between political expression and the perceived impartiality expected of Supreme Court justices. 

END OF SUMMARY.
