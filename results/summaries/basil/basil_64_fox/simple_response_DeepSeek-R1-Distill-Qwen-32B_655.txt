Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, Justice Ginsburg criticized Trump, calling him a faker and unqualified. She faced backlash from both sides, including Trump himself. The article mentions that even some Democrats and media criticized her for being too political. The moral issue here is about the appropriate role of a Supreme Court Justice in political matters.

I should highlight Ginsburg's comments, the backlash from Trump and others, and the concerns about the impartiality of the Supreme Court. Also, note that some Democrats were uncomfortable, and the media criticized her for politicizing the court. Mention that her actions raised questions about judicial impartiality.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the tokens. Make sure to include the main points without getting too detailed.
