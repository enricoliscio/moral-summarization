Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg facing backlash after criticizing Donald Trump. She called him a "faker" and questioned his qualifications. 

First, I should note the key points: Ginsburg's comments, the reactions from Trump, other politicians, and media. Trump called her statements "dumb" and urged her to resign. Bipartisan criticism followed, with both Republicans and some Democrats expressing concern that her comments were inappropriate for a Supreme Court justice. 

I should include the fact that her comments were published in The New York Times and CNN. Also, the article mentions the Code of Conduct for judges, which advises against endorsing or opposing candidates. Mainstream media criticized her for politicizing the court. 

On the other hand, Bernie Sanders supported her stance on Trump, though not her method of addressing it. 

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting Ginsburg's criticism, the backlash from Trump and others, and the broader implications for the court's impartiality. I should make sure to mention the bipartisan nature of the criticism and the reactions from both parties and media. 

I should structure it to start with Ginsburg's comments, then the reactions, including Trump's response, the Republican leaders' comments, the Democratic lawmakers' hesitations, and the media's criticism. Finally, mention Bernie Sanders' support but his caution on the method. 

I need to be clear and concise, ensuring all main points are covered without going into too much detail. Let me make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the event, followed by the reactions, and the implications.
