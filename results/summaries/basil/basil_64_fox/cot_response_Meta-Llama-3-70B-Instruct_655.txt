SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump lashed out, saying her "mind is shot" and she should resign. Many, including Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers, deemed her comments "inappropriate" and "biased", arguing that they undermined the public's faith in the impartiality of the courts. Even those who agree with her views felt she had gone too far, with some calling her comments a "disgrace" and a "spectacle". However, Bernie Sanders came to her defense, calling Trump a "total opportunist" who "lies just a whole lot of the time". The controversy has sparked a debate about the role of the Supreme Court in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
