Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should include as many as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Justice Ginsburg criticized Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified. This caused a backlash from both parties, including Trump himself, who told her to resign. She also criticized the press for being "gentle" with Trump. Republicans and some Democrats criticized her for being "inappropriate" and "biased," undermining the court's "objectivity." Media outlets agreed, saying it's "partisan" and that judges shouldn't "endorse" or "oppose" candidates. Some, like Bernie Sanders, supported her but didn't comment on the appropriateness.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: faker, turning, gentle, involved, inappropriate, objective, weigh, biased, undermines, endorse, oppose, partisan, lies. I'll make sure to use these words in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to mention Ginsburg's comments, the backlash, the criticism from both sides, the media's stance, and the support from Sanders. I'll ensure each key point includes the moral terms.

Let me draft it step by step, keeping it concise. I'll start with her criticism, mention the backlash, then the various criticisms, and end with some support. I'll check the word count to stay under 200.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications for presidency. Trump responded by demanding her resignation, while political figures and media criticized her comments as "inappropriate" and "biased," undermining the court's "objectivity." Ginsburg also criticized the press for being "gentle" with Trump, sparking concerns about the court's impartiality. Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan echoed these criticisms, warning against "partisan" involvement in the judiciary. Even some Democrats, like Sen. Chris Murphy, expressed discomfort with her "forthright" political statements. Media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, condemned her actions, emphasizing that judges should not "endorse" or "oppose" candidates. Despite the criticism, Bernie Sanders defended Ginsburg, calling Trump a "total opportunist" and noting his tendency to "lie." END OF SUMMARY.
