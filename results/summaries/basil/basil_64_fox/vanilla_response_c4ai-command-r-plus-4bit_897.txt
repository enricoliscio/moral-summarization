SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense backlash from both sides of the political spectrum after publicly criticizing Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Ginsburg called Trump a "faker" and questioned his qualifications, sparking outrage from Trump himself, Republican leaders, Democratic lawmakers, and even mainstream media outlets. Trump called for Ginsburg's resignation, while GOP leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan condemned her comments as inappropriate and biased. Democratic lawmakers also expressed discomfort with Ginsburg's remarks, suggesting they could undermine the public's faith in the impartiality of the courts. The Washington Post and The New York Times echoed similar sentiments, with the Times calling Ginsburg's actions "highly inappropriate." Despite the backlash, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg's comments, agreeing with her assessment of Trump as an opportunist and a liar.
