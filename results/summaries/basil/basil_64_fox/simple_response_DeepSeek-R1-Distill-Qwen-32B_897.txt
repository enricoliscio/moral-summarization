Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, the article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg facing backlash after criticizing Donald Trump. She called him a "faker" and questioned his qualifications. The backlash is bipartisan, with Trump himself calling for her resignation. Even some Democrats and media outlets criticized her for making political statements as a Supreme Court justice.

I should focus on the main elements: Ginsburg's comments, the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, and the media. The moral framing here is about the appropriateness of a Supreme Court justice making political statements. The article suggests that her actions undermine the court's impartiality, which is a key moral issue.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning her criticism and the backlash, then outline the reactions from different groups. I should include the points that her comments were seen as inappropriate and the potential impact on public trust in the judiciary.

Also, the summary should end with Bernie Sanders' support, showing that not everyone agreed with the criticism. I need to balance the negative reactions with that one positive note.

Let me structure it: first, Ginsburg's comments and the backlash. Then, Trump's and others' reactions. Mention the media and Democrats' concerns about impartiality. Finally, note Sanders' support. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan criticism after harshly criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications for presidency. Trump demanded her resignation, while Republican leaders and even some Democrats criticized her for making political statements as a Supreme Court justice. Ginsburg's comments, including her assertion that Trump's presidency would be damaging to the country and the court, were deemed inappropriate, with many arguing they undermine the court's impartiality. Media outlets also criticized her for politicizing her position, citing the Code of Conduct for judges, which discourages public endorsements of candidates. While most reactions were negative, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders defended her characterization of Trump as an opportunist and liar, though he did not comment on the appropriateness of her remarks. END OF SUMMARY.
