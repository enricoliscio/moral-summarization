Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg facing backlash for her comments about Donald Trump. She called him a "faker" and criticized his qualifications for presidency. Trump responded by calling her statements "dumb" and urged her to resign. 

I should note that the backlash is bipartisan, meaning both Republicans and some Democrats are criticizing her. Republican leaders like McConnell and Ryan are saying her comments were inappropriate and undermine the court's impartiality. Even some Democrats, like Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin, think she went too far. 

Mainstream media also criticized her, pointing out that judges shouldn't endorse or oppose candidates publicly. The Washington Post and New York Times both mentioned this. However, Bernie Sanders supported her comments, calling Trump an opportunist and liar.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the key points: Ginsburg's comments, the backlash from Trump, Republicans, some Democrats, media, and Bernie Sanders' support. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with her comments, then the reactions, and ending with the mixed support.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure each point is clear and concise without unnecessary details. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."
