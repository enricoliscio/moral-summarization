SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump lashed out, saying her comments were "dumb" and that she should resign. Many politicians and newspaper editorial writers, including Republicans and Democrats, agreed that her comments were "inappropriate" and "biased", and that they "undermined" public faith in the impartiality of the courts. The Code of Conduct for U.S. judges states that a "judge should not... publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office." Even those who agree with her views, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged that her comments were unusual and may have been too "forthright" and "political". The criticism centered around the idea that a Supreme Court justice should remain "objective" and not "weigh in" on political campaigns. Trump's response was seen as an attempt to "turn" the tables and deflect criticism, and his own history of "lies" and lack of transparency on his tax returns was highlighted. END OF SUMMARY.
