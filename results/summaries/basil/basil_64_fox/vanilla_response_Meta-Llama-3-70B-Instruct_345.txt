SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced backlash from both parties after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded on Twitter, saying Ginsburg's comments were "dumb" and that she should resign. Many politicians and media outlets, including Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers, agreed that Ginsburg's comments were inappropriate for a Supreme Court justice. They argued that her comments undermined public faith in the impartiality of the courts. Even those who agree with her views felt she went too far. The Washington Post and The New York Times editorial boards also criticized Ginsburg's comments, citing the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support to Ginsburg's comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who lies frequently.

END OF SUMMARY.
