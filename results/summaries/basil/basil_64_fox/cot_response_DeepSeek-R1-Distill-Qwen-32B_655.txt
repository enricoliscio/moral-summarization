Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Justice Ginsburg criticizing Trump, leading to a backlash from both parties.

The user wants me to identify morally framed words first. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral judgment. Words like "backlash," "embarrassed," "dumb," "shot," "icon," "contemplate," "faker," "inappropriate," "disgrace," "objective," "skepticism," "biased," "unusual," "endorse," "oppose," "partisan," "spectacle," "opportunism," "lies," and "qualify." These words show approval or disapproval.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping those moral terms. I'll mention Ginsburg's criticism, the backlash, Trump's and others' reactions, the media's stance, and the support she received. I should keep it under 200 words, making sure to include the key moral elements without going into too much detail.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: start with Ginsburg's comments, then the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, media, and finally some support. This way, it captures the moral framing effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications. Trump and Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, criticized her comments as "inappropriate" and "biased," undermining the court's impartiality. Even some Democrats, like Sen. Chris Murphy, expressed concern that her remarks were "unusual" and could harm public trust in the judiciary. Media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, echoed these concerns, emphasizing the importance of judicial neutrality. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered qualified support, agreeing with Ginsburg's assessment of Trump as an "opportunistic liar." The controversy highlights the tension between judicial impartiality and political expression.
