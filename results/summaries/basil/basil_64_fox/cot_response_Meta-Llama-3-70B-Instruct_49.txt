SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump and Republican leaders condemned her comments as "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace" to the court. Even Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media outlets agreed that her remarks were "out of line" and "unusual", citing concerns about politicization and impartiality. Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying Ginsburg's "mind is shot" and she should resign. The liberal icon justice doubled down on her criticism, saying Trump has "no consistency" and an "ego". Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support for her comments, calling Trump a "total opportunist" who "lies just a whole lot of the time". The controversy raises questions about the role of the Supreme Court in politics and the importance of impartiality. END OF SUMMARY.
