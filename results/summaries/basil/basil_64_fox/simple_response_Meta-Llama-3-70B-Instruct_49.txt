SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced widespread criticism for her comments about Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications to be president. Even those who share her views felt she overstepped her bounds as a high court justice. Trump himself lashed out, calling her comments "dumb" and demanding her resignation. Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers alike condemned her remarks, citing concerns about the impartiality of the Supreme Court. Mainstream media outlets also joined the chorus of criticism, noting that her comments undermined public faith in the courts. While some, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, agreed with her assessment of Trump, they stopped short of endorsing her decision to speak out. The backlash raises important questions about the role of the judiciary in politics and the importance of maintaining public trust in the institution.
