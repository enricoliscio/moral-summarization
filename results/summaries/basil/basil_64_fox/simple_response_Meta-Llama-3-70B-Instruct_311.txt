SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sparked a bipartisan backlash after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Her comments were deemed inappropriate by both Republicans and Democrats, who argued that a Supreme Court justice should remain impartial and not engage in political campaigns. Trump himself responded, saying Ginsburg's mind is "shot" and calling for her resignation. Even liberal figures and newspaper editorial writers criticized Ginsburg's comments, citing the importance of maintaining public faith in the impartiality of the courts. The controversy highlights the delicate balance between justices' personal opinions and their duty to remain objective. While Ginsburg's criticism of Trump may be valid, her decision to publicly express them has sparked concerns about politicization and the erosion of trust in the judiciary. END OF SUMMARY.
