SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense criticism and calls to resign from both sides of the political spectrum after making disparaging remarks about Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Ginsburg, a liberal icon, described Trump as a "faker" and unqualified for the presidency, expressing her inability to imagine a country with him as leader. Trump fired back, calling for her resignation and accusing her of embarrassing the Supreme Court with her "dumb political statements." Ginsburg's comments sparked concerns about the politicization of the judiciary and the potential bias of the Supreme Court, with Republican leaders and even some Democrats expressing discomfort. Mainstream media outlets also criticized Ginsburg, citing the importance of impartiality in the judiciary. Despite the backlash, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg's remarks, agreeing with her characterization of Trump as an opportunist and a liar. The episode underscores the delicate balance between political expression and the expected neutrality of those in high judicial office.
END OF SUMMARY.
