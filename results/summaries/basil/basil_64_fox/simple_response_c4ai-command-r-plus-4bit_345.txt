SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced fierce backlash from both sides of the political aisle after making critical comments about Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Ginsburg, a liberal icon, called Trump a "faker" and unqualified for the presidency, sparking outrage from political figures and media outlets. Trump demanded her resignation, claiming her mind was "shot." Ginsburg's comments were deemed "inappropriate" and "biased" by Republican leaders and some Democratic lawmakers, who believed they undermined the impartiality of the courts. Even those who agreed with her assessment of Trump felt her remarks were out of line for a Supreme Court justice. Ginsburg's defense came from an unexpected source: Senator Bernie Sanders, who agreed with her characterization of Trump as an opportunist and a liar. Ginsburg's comments breached the expected impartiality of a Supreme Court justice, and many believed she crossed a line by publicly opposing a political candidate.
END OF SUMMARY.
