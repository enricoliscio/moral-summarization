SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded, saying her comments were "dumb" and that she should resign, as she had "embarrassed all" with her "inappropriate" statements. Many, including Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers, agreed that her comments were out of line for a high court justice, raising concerns about the politicization of the court and undermining public faith in its impartiality. Even those who agreed with her sentiments, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged that her comments were unusual and may have been better left unsaid. The controversy has sparked a debate about the role of the Supreme Court in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
