SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense backlash, including calls for her resignation, after publicly criticizing Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, as a "faker" unqualified for the presidency. Trump fired back, calling for her resignation and accusing her of embarrassing the Supreme Court with her "dumb political statements." Ginsburg's comments sparked bipartisan criticism, with Republican leaders and even some Democratic lawmakers deeming them inappropriate and a potential threat to the perceived impartiality of the judiciary. Mainstream media outlets joined the chorus of condemnation, citing the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges. However, Ginsburg found some support from Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who agreed with her characterization of Trump as an opportunist and a liar. The incident highlights the delicate balance between political expression and the expected neutrality of high-ranking judicial officials. END OF SUMMARY.
