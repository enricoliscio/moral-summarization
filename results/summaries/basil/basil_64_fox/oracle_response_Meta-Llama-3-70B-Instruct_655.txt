SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded, saying her comments were "highly inappropriate" and that she should "apologize to the court." Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, echoed Trump's criticisms, saying her comments were "totally inappropriate" and "inherently biased." Even Democratic lawmakers, such as Sen. Chris Murphy and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, expressed discomfort with her remarks, saying they were "out of line" for a high court justice. Mainstream media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, also criticized her comments, saying they "undermine public faith in the impartiality of the courts" and that she should not have "flung herself into the mosh pit" of politics. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support for her comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who "lies just a whole lot of the time."
