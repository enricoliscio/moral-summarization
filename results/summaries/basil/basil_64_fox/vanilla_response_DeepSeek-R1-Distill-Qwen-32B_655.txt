Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg facing backlash for her comments about Donald Trump. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash, including Trump calling for her resignation. She criticized Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified. The backlash came from both political figures and media. Trump responded by saying her comments were inappropriate and that she should apologize. Republican leaders like McConnell and Ryan echoed this, saying her comments were inappropriate and raised doubts about the court's impartiality. Even some Democrats were uncomfortable with her comments, though they acknowledged justices have political views. Mainstream media criticized her as well, pointing out the code of conduct for judges which advises against endorsing or opposing candidates. The Washington Post and New York Times both criticized her involvement in the political arena. However, Bernie Sanders supported her comments, agreeing with her assessment of Trump.

So, the main points are:
- Ginsburg criticized Trump, calling him unqualified and a faker.
- This led to a backlash from both parties, including Trump calling for her resignation.
- Republican leaders and some Democrats criticized her for mixing politics with the judiciary.
- Media outlets also criticized her, citing the code of conduct.
- Bernie Sanders supported her, agreeing with her assessment of Trump.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include all these points concisely. I'll start by mentioning the backlash, then her comments, followed by the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, and the media, and finally mention Sanders' support.
