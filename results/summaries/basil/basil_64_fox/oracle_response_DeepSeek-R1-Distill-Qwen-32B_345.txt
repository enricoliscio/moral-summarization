Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Justice Ginsburg criticized Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications. This led to backlash from both parties, including Trump himself, who demanded she resign. Republican leaders and some Democrats criticized her for being too political. Media outlets also weighed in, emphasizing the importance of judicial impartiality. The Washington Post mentioned the code of conduct about not endorsing or opposing candidates. The New York Times criticized the politicization. Bernie Sanders supported her but didn't comment on the appropriateness.

I need to include the key moral terms: faker, turning, gentle, involved, inappropriate, objective, weigh, biased, undermines, endorse, oppose, partisan, lies.

I'll structure the summary to mention Ginsburg's criticism, the backlash, the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, media, and Sanders. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate.

Let me start drafting: Ginsburg criticized Trump as a faker, leading to bipartisan backlash. Trump called her comments dumb and demanded resignation. Republicans and some Democrats said it's inappropriate for a justice to get involved in politics. Media highlighted the importance of objectivity and impartiality, noting the code against endorsing candidates. Sanders agreed Trump is an opportunist but didn't address the appropriateness.

I think that covers all the necessary points and includes most of the moral terms. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the required tokens.
