Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Justice Ginsburg facing backlash for her comments on Trump. I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: her criticism, the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, and the media. Also, I should highlight the moral issues like impartiality and the potential impact on public trust in the judiciary. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me start by identifying the main events and the different reactions, then craft a summary that flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced widespread criticism after making remarks about Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications for presidency. Her comments sparked bipartisan backlash, with Trump himself demanding her resignation and accusing her of making "dumb political statements." Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, criticized her for being "totally inappropriate" and undermining the court's impartiality. Even some Democrats, like Sen. Chris Murphy, expressed concern that her comments were overly political. Mainstream media also condemned her actions, citing the importance of judicial impartiality and noting that judges should avoid endorsing or opposing political candidates. While some, like Bernie Sanders, agreed with her assessment of Trump, the majority viewed her remarks as inappropriate, raising questions about the court's objectivity. END OF SUMMARY.
