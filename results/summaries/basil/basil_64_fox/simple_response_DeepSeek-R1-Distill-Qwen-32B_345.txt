Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the backlash against Justice Ginsburg.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Justice Ginsburg criticized Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified. This led to bipartisan backlash, with Trump and Republican leaders like McConnell and Ryan criticizing her. Even some Democrats and media outlets disapproved, pointing out that Supreme Court justices should remain impartial. The Washington Post and New York Times also criticized her for politicizing the court. However, Bernie Sanders supported her, agreeing with her assessment of Trump.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the main points: Ginsburg's criticism, the backlash from both parties, the argument about impartiality, and the support from Sanders. I'll make sure to mention the ethical concern about judges not taking sides in political campaigns.

I'll start by stating Ginsburg's criticism and the backlash. Then, mention Trump's and others' reactions, emphasizing the issue of impartiality. Finally, note the support from Sanders and the media's stance on the matter. I need to keep it concise but cover all these aspects without exceeding the word limit.

Let me structure it: Ginsburg's comments, the criticism from Trump and others, the argument against impartiality, media and Democrats' reactions, and Sanders' support. I'll ensure each point is brief but clear.

I think that covers all the necessary parts while maintaining the moral framing. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

Even some Democrats and media outlets criticized her for politicizing the court, arguing that justices should remain impartial. The Washington Post and New York Times also criticized her for undermining public faith in the court's neutrality. While some, like Bernie Sanders, supported her assessment of Trump, most agreed that her comments crossed a line, raising ethical concerns about judges taking sides in political campaigns. END OF SUMMARY.
