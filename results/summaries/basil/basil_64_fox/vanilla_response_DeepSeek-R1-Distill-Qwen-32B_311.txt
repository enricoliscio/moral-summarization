Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg facing backlash for her comments about Donald Trump. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

Okay, the article says that Ginsburg criticized Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications. This caused a bipartisan backlash, with Trump himself calling for her resignation. Even some Democrats and media outlets criticized her for making political statements as a Supreme Court justice. They argue that her comments undermine the court's impartiality. However, Bernie Sanders supported her, agreeing with her assessment of Trump.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these elements: Ginsburg's criticism, the backlash from Trump and others, the concern about impartiality, and Sanders' support. Also, I should mention that her comments were seen as inappropriate for a justice.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with Ginsburg's comments, then the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, and media. Finally, mention Sanders' support. I should keep it clear and straightforward without getting too detailed.

Wait, I should also include that she doubled down on her statements, emphasizing her criticism. And that the backlash was bipartisan, including from both political figures and media. Also, the mention of the Code of Conduct for judges about not endorsing or opposing candidates is important to highlight why her comments were problematic.

I think that's all the key points. Now, I'll put it together in a summary, making sure it's within the word limit and flows well.
