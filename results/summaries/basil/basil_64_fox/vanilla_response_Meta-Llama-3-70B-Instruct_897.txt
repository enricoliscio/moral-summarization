SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced backlash from both parties after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded, calling her comments "dumb" and demanding her resignation. Many politicians and newspaper editorial writers, including some Democrats, agreed that her comments were out of line for a high court justice. Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan echoed Trump's criticisms, saying her comments raised questions about the court's objectivity. Even some Democrats, like Sen. Chris Murphy and Sen. Dick Durbin, expressed discomfort with her remarks. Mainstream media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, also criticized her comments, citing the need for impartiality in the judiciary. Only Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for her comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who lies frequently.
