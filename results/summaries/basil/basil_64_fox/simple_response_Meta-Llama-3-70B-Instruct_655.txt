SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified to be president. Many, including Trump himself, deemed her comments inappropriate for a high court justice. Trump called for her resignation, saying her mind is "shot." Even those who agree with her views felt she overstepped her bounds. Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers alike criticized her comments, citing concerns about the politicization of the Supreme Court and the importance of impartiality. Mainstream media outlets, such as The Washington Post and The New York Times, also joined in the criticism, noting that her comments undermined public faith in the courts. Only Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for her comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who frequently lies.
