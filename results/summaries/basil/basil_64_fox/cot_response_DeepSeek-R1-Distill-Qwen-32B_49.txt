Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Justice Ginsburg criticizing Trump and the backlash she received. 

The user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "backlash," "call," "resign," "faker," "unqualified," "embarrassed," "dumb," "shot," "icon," "storm," "contemplate," "inappropriate," "disgrace," "skepticism," "objective," "balls and strikes," "biased," "realm," "squirming," "endorse," "oppose," "valid," "partisan," "spectacle," "flinging," "mosh pit," "opportunism," "lies." These words carry moral weight, indicating approval or disapproval.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should capture the key points: Ginsburg's criticism, the backlash from Trump and others, the reaction from both parties, and the debate over judicial impartiality. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I'll start by mentioning the growing backlash against Ginsburg, including Trump's call for her resignation. Then, I'll note her calling Trump a "faker" and the widespread criticism she received. I'll include the reactions from both Republicans and Democrats, highlighting the concern over judicial impartiality. Finally, I'll mention the support from Bernie Sanders to show some backing despite the backlash.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the essential points. I'll ensure the morally framed words are integrated naturally into the summary to reflect the author's original moral stance.

**SUMMARY:**  

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a growing bipartisan backlash after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications for the presidency. Trump and Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, condemned her comments as inappropriate and biased, arguing they undermine the court's impartiality. Even some Democrats, like Sen. Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin, expressed discomfort with her public political statements. Mainstream media also criticized her for politicizing the court, citing the Code of Conduct for judges. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered qualified support, agreeing with Ginsburg's assessment of Trump as an opportunist and liar. The controversy highlights concerns about judicial impartiality and the potential erosion of public trust in the Supreme Court.
