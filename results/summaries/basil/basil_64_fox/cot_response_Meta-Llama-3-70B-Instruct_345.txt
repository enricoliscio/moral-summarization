SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded, saying Ginsburg's comments were "dumb" and "inappropriate", and that she should "resign" because her mind is "shot". Many politicians and newspaper editorial writers, including Republicans and Democrats, agreed that her comments were out of line for a high court justice, citing concerns about politicization and impartiality. Even those who agreed with her views said she should not have aired them publicly. The criticism was so widespread that it raised questions about the court's impartiality and the politicization of the judiciary. Only Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support, calling Trump a "total opportunist" who "lies just a whole lot of the time". END OF SUMMARY.
