Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has given a specific list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticizing Donald Trump, which caused a backlash. She called him a "faker" and unqualified, leading Trump and others to criticize her for being political. The author used words like "faker," "inappropriate," "objective," "biased," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll identify the main events: Ginsburg's comments, the reactions from Trump, Republicans, Democrats, and media. She defended her stance, calling Trump a faker and questioning his qualifications. Trump responded by calling her statements inappropriate and demanded an apology. Republican leaders like McConnell and Ryan criticized her for bias, while some Democrats were also uneasy. Media criticized her for politicizing the court, citing the code of conduct about not endorsing candidates. Bernie Sanders supported her but didn't comment on the appropriateness.

I should structure the summary to include all these points concisely, using the specified moral terms. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and ends with the required tokens.

Let me start drafting: Ginsburg criticized Trump as a faker, leading to backlash. Mention Trump's response, Republican leaders' criticism about bias, Democrats' mixed reactions, media's concern about impartiality, and Sanders' support.

I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, make sure all the moral terms are included naturally in the summary.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan criticism after calling Donald Trump a "faker" and questioning his qualifications for presidency. Trump labeled her statements "highly inappropriate" and demanded an apology, while Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan criticized her for being "biased" and "inappropriately" involved in politics. Democratic lawmakers also expressed unease, with Sen. Chris Murphy noting justices should avoid publicly "endorsing" or "opposing" candidates. Mainstream media echoed concerns, emphasizing the need for judicial "objectivity" and warning that such comments could "undermine" public trust in the court's impartiality. Bernie Sanders defended Ginsburg, calling Trump a "total opportunist" and acknowledging his tendency to "lie." END OF SUMMARY.
