SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded by calling on her to resign, saying her mind is "shot" and that she made "dumb political statements" about him. Many politicians and newspaper editorial writers, including Republicans and Democrats, agreed that her comments were out of line for a high court justice. They argued that her statements undermined public faith in the impartiality of the courts and were a breach of the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges. Even some Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Murphy and Sen. Dick Durbin, expressed discomfort with her comments. However, Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who lies frequently. The controversy has sparked a debate about the role of Supreme Court justices in political campaigns.
