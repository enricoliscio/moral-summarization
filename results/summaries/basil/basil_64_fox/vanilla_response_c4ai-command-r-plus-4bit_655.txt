SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced backlash from both sides of the political spectrum for her criticism of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Ginsburg called Trump a "faker" and unqualified for the presidency, prompting Trump to call for her resignation, stating that her "mind is shot." Ginsburg's comments were deemed inappropriate by many, including Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers, who felt they crossed a line for a Supreme Court justice. Mainstream media outlets also criticized Ginsburg, citing concerns about the politicization of the court. The Washington Post and The New York Times editorial boards weighed in, with the former noting that the Code of Conduct for US judges prohibits public endorsement or opposition of political candidates. On Wednesday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg's comments, agreeing with her assessment of Trump as an opportunist and a liar. 

END OF SUMMARY.
