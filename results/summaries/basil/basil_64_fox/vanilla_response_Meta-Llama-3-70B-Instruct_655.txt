SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified to be president. Trump responded on Twitter, saying Ginsburg's comments were "dumb" and that she should resign. Many politicians and media outlets, including Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers, criticized Ginsburg's comments as inappropriate and politicizing the Supreme Court. The Washington Post and The New York Times editorial boards also condemned her statements, citing the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support for Ginsburg's comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who lies frequently. The controversy has raised concerns about the impartiality of the Supreme Court and the politicization of the judiciary.

END OF SUMMARY.
