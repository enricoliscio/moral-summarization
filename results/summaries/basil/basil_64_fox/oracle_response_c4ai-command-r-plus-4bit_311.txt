SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense backlash for her criticism of then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified. Trump demanded her resignation, claiming her comments embarrassed the Supreme Court and questioning her mental capacity. Ginsburg's remarks sparked bipartisan criticism, with Republican leaders and even some Democrats deeming them inappropriate and undermining the Court's impartiality.

The Washington Post and The New York Times editorial boards joined the chorus of criticism, emphasizing the potential damage to the public's faith in an unbiased judiciary. Despite the backlash, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg's comments, agreeing with her assessment of Trump as an opportunist and a liar. Ginsburg's remarks highlighted the delicate balance between political expression and the expected neutrality of Supreme Court justices.
