SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced fierce backlash, including calls for her resignation, after publicly criticizing Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president, as a "faker" and unqualified for the presidency. Trump, in turn, denounced Ginsburg's comments as "highly inappropriate," suggesting her "mind is shot." Ginsburg's remarks also drew criticism from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who expressed concern over the potential bias and politicization of the Supreme Court. Mainstream media outlets joined in, emphasizing the importance of judicial impartiality and the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges, which discouages public endorsements or opposition of political candidates. Ginsburg's comments sparked a debate about the appropriate boundaries of political expression for Supreme Court justices, with some arguing that her remarks undermined public faith in the court's neutrality. Despite the backlash, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg, agreeing with her assessment of Trump's character.
