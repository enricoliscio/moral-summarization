SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced widespread criticism for her outspoken comments about Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications to be president. The backlash was bipartisan, with even Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media outlets saying her remarks were inappropriate and undermined the impartiality of the courts. Trump himself lashed out, calling for her resignation and saying her mind was "shot." The criticism centered on the idea that a Supreme Court justice should remain impartial and not engage in political campaigns. While some, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, agreed with Ginsburg's assessment of Trump, they also acknowledged that her comments were out of line for a justice. The incident raises important questions about the role of the judiciary in a democratic society and the importance of maintaining public trust in the courts.
