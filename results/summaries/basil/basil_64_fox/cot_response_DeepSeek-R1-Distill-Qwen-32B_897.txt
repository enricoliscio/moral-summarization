Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Justice Ginsburg facing backlash for her comments about Trump. My task is to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment, either positive or negative. They can indicate approval, disapproval, or a value judgment. So, I'll go through the article and pick out words that express such judgments.

Looking at the article, I see words like "backlash," "call," "resign," "faker," "unqualified," "embarrassed," "dumb," "shot," "icon," "contemplate," "inappropriate," "disgrace," "skepticism," "objective," "strike," "biased," "inherent," "unusual," "endorse," "oppose," "partisan," "spectacle," "endorse," "oppose," "spectacle," "opportunistic," "lies." These words all carry some moral weight, either criticizing or supporting actions or individuals.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible while staying under 200 words. The summary should capture the essence of the article, highlighting the backlash Ginsburg faced, the various reactions from different political figures, and the broader implications for the Supreme Court's impartiality.

I'll start by stating that Ginsburg faced backlash for her comments. Then mention Trump's call for her resignation and his criticism. I'll include the bipartisan reactions, noting that even Democrats were uneasy. I'll highlight the editorial comments about the court's impartiality and the code of conduct. Finally, I'll mention Sanders' support but note that it was limited.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the key moral terms without making it too verbose. I'll structure it to show the range of reactions, from Trump and Republicans to Democrats and media, and touch on the implications for the court's reputation.

I should also make sure the summary is concise, sticking to the main points without getting bogged down in details. Including the moral words will help preserve the original framing, showing the intensity of the reactions and the underlying concerns about judicial impartiality.

After drafting, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 and that all the key moral terms are included. I'll also make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains a neutral tone while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash after criticizing Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and questioning his qualifications. Trump demanded her resignation, while political figures and media criticized her for politicizing the court. Ginsburg's comments, including her doubts about Trump's presidency, sparked concerns about the court's impartiality. Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan condemned her remarks as inappropriate, while even Democrats expressed unease. Media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, echoed concerns about the politicization of the judiciary. Despite the criticism, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders defended Ginsburg's right to express her views, though he stopped short of endorsing her comments. The incident highlighted tensions over judicial impartiality and the role of Supreme Court justices in political discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
