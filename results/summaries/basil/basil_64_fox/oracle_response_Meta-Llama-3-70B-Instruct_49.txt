SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump lashed out, saying her mind is "shot" and demanding she resign. Many, including Republican leaders and Democratic lawmakers, deemed her comments "inappropriate" and "biased", arguing they undermined the impartiality of the court. The Washington Post's editorial board noted that the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges prohibits publicly endorsing or opposing a candidate for public office. Even those who agree with her views, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged that her comments were unusual and may have been better left unsaid. The controversy highlights the importance of judges remaining "objective" and not "weighing in" on political campaigns. Ginsburg's comments were seen as "politicization" that could erode public faith in the courts. END OF SUMMARY.
