SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced widespread criticism for her comments about Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" and unqualified to be president. While her views may be shared by many, her statements were deemed inappropriate for a high court justice. Trump, Republican leaders, and even some Democrats condemned her remarks, citing concerns about the impartiality of the Supreme Court. The Washington Post and The New York Times editorial boards also criticized her comments, noting that they undermine public faith in the courts. The Code of Conduct for U.S. judges prohibits judges from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates. Despite the backlash, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg's comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who lies frequently. The controversy highlights the importance of maintaining the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.
