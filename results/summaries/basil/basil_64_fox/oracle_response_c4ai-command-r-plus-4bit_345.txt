SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense backlash and calls to resign from both sides of the political spectrum for her outspoken criticism of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Ginsburg described Trump as a "faker" and questioned his qualifications for the presidency, suggesting that his election could have dire consequences for the country and the Court. Trump responded by calling for her resignation, arguing that her comments were "highly inappropriate" and embarrassing for the Court. Republican leaders joined the chorus of criticism, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan condemning Ginsburg's remarks as "biased" and "out of the realm." Democratic lawmakers also expressed discomfort, acknowledging that while justices have political views, Ginsburg's public endorsement may have been unwise. Mainstream media outlets agreed that her comments undermined the perceived impartiality of the courts and violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges, which prohibits public endorsement or opposition to political candidates. Despite the backlash, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg, agreeing that Trump is an opportunist who lies frequently.
END OF SUMMARY.
