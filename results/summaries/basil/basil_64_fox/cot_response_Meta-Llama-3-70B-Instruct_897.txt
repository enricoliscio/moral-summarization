SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded by saying Ginsburg's comments were "dumb" and "inappropriate", and that she should resign. Republican congressional leaders echoed Trump's criticisms, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying her comments were "totally inappropriate" and raised concerns about the court's "impartiality". Even Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media outlets criticized Ginsburg's comments, with The Washington Post's editorial board saying they undermined public faith in the courts. However, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave qualified support for her comments, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who "lies just a whole lot of the time". END OF SUMMARY.
