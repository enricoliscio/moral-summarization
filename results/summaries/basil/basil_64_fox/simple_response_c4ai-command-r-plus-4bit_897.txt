SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced intense backlash and calls for her resignation after publicly criticizing Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president, as a "faker" unqualified for the presidency. Trump fired back, calling for her resignation and suggesting her "mind is shot." Ginsburg's comments, which many deemed inappropriate for a Supreme Court justice, sparked bipartisan criticism and concerns about the politicization of the judiciary. Republican leaders, such as Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, echoed Trump's sentiments, while Democratic lawmakers expressed discomfort with Ginsburg's remarks. Mainstream media outlets also chastised the justice, emphasizing the importance of judicial impartiality and the potential damage caused by her breach of decorum. Despite the backlash, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg, agreeing with her characterization of Trump as an opportunist and frequent liar. Ginsburg's unprecedented foray into partisan politics raised questions about the boundaries of judicial conduct and the integrity of the Supreme Court.
END OF SUMMARY.
