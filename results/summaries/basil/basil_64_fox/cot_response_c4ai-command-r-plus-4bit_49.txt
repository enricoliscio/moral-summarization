SUMMARY: 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon and Supreme Court Justice, faced a moral backlash for her outspoken criticism of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president. Her comments, calling Trump a "faker" and unqualified, sparked bipartisan outrage as many deemed them inappropriate and undermining the impartiality expected of a Supreme Court Justice. Ginsburg's remarks were seen as a breach of the moral code of conduct for judges, with some calling for her resignation. Trump himself lashed out, accusing Ginsburg of embarrassing the court and questioning her mental capacity. Despite the backlash, Ginsburg stood by her statements, highlighting Trump's inconsistency and ego. The controversy brought moral questions of politicization and bias to the forefront, with even Democratic lawmakers expressing discomfort. However, Senator Bernie Sanders defended Ginsburg's stance, agreeing that Trump is an opportunist who lies frequently. The incident underscores the delicate balance between personal beliefs and the impartiality expected of those in high judicial office. 

END OF SUMMARY.
