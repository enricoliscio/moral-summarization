SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced bipartisan backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, calling him a "faker" who is unqualified to be president. Trump responded by saying Ginsburg's comments were "highly inappropriate" and that she should "apologize to the court". Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, echoed Trump's criticisms, saying Ginsburg's comments were "totally inappropriate" and "inherently biased". Even Democratic lawmakers, such as Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin, expressed discomfort with Ginsburg's remarks, saying she may have been too "forthright and political". Mainstream media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, also criticized Ginsburg, saying her comments "undermined public faith in the impartiality of the courts" and were "partisan". Only Bernie Sanders offered qualified support, agreeing that Trump is a "total opportunist" who "lies just a whole lot of the time".
