SUMMARY: 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a fierce backlash for her criticism of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president. Ginsburg called Trump a "faker" and questioned his qualifications, sparking outrage from both sides of the political aisle. Trump demanded her resignation, calling her comments "very dumb" and embarrassing. Ginsburg's remarks were deemed "inappropriate" and "biased" by political figures and editorial boards, who argued that they undermined the impartiality of the courts. Ginsburg's comments were seen as a violation of the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges, which prohibits public endorsements or opposition of political candidates. The backlash highlighted the moral dilemma of a Supreme Court justice expressing political views, with some arguing that it called into question the court's objectivity and impartiality. Despite the criticism, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered qualified support for Ginsburg, agreeing with her assessment of Trump as an "opportunist" and a liar.
END OF SUMMARY.
