SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to accuse Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of compromising national security by failing to follow basic security protocols. He also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations into his political opponents, referring to them as a "deep state." This continues a pattern of attacks by Mr. Trump on Mrs. Clinton and reflects his dissatisfaction with the Justice Department. The accusations against Ms. Abedin stem from an article in The Daily Caller, which alleged that she forwarded government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Mr. Trump's Twitter post also referenced a case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, suggesting a double standard in the justice system. Mrs. Clinton has previously stated that the discovery of her own private email server, which was also used by Ms. Abedin, hurt her campaign and contributed to Mr. Trump's victory in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump's actions raise concerns about his commitment to ethical standards and the rule of law, particularly in his willingness to use his position to target political opponents and influence law enforcement investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
