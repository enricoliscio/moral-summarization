SUMMARY:

President Trump has accused a former Hillary Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump made the accusation on Twitter, calling for an investigation into Abedin's actions. The passwords were compromised in a 2013 Yahoo hack, and the data was later offered for sale by a hacking collective. Trump also referred to the Justice Department as a "deep state" and mentioned the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. The sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from Trump. The Twitter post is part of Trump's ongoing attacks on Clinton, which have continued almost 14 months after the 2016 presidential election.

END OF SUMMARY.
