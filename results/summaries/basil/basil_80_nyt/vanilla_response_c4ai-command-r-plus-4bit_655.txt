SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of compromising national security by forwarding government passwords to her personal email account in 2009. Trump's tweet came after an article in The Daily Caller and targeted both Abedin and the Justice Department, which he referred to as a "deep state." The incident in question involved Abedin forwarding passwords to her Yahoo email account, which was hacked in 2013. Trump's criticism of Abedin and Clinton echoes his previous attacks on Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. The State Department recently released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, discovered on her estranged husband's laptop, in response to a public records request. Trump's tweet also referenced a Navy sailor's case, expressing disappointment that the sailor had not been pardoned despite taking pictures inside a military submarine.
END OF SUMMARY.
