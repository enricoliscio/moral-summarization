SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked his former opponent Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump also referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state" and implored his administration to investigate Abedin. This comes after the State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, which were found on her estranged husband's laptop. Trump's attack is seen as a continuation of his regular drumbeat of attacks on Clinton, almost 14 months after the election. The president's actions are morally questionable, as they seem to be driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of respect for the democratic process. By using terms like "deep state," Trump is also perpetuating a dangerous narrative that undermines trust in democratic institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
