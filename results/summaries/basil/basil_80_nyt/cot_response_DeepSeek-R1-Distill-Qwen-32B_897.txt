Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about Trump accusing Huma Abedin of failing to follow security protocols. Words like "failing," "disregarding," and "basic security protocols" seem to carry moral weight. He also calls the Justice Department a "deep state," which implies a hidden, possibly corrupt group. Terms like "shadow government," "secretly plot," "influence policy," "authoritarian elements," and "undercut democratically elected leaders" all have strong moral connotations. The article mentions "attacks," "criticized," "hacked," "data for sale," "sore spot," "hurt," "momentum," "helped," "jailed," "pardon," and "unfair." These words suggest wrongdoing, criticism, and negative outcomes.

Now, for the summary. I need to include these morally framed words while keeping it concise. I should mention Trump's accusation, the specific actions by Abedin, the hacking incident, and the implications. Also, include the release of emails and the sailor's case. Make sure to highlight the moral framing by using the identified words.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's accusation, mention the aide's action, the hacking, the term "deep state," the email release, and the sailor's pardon. Keep each sentence tight and include the key moral terms.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private email in 2009. He also criticized the Justice Department, calling it a "deep state," a term implying a shadow government secretly influencing policy. The accusation followed a report that Yahoo accounts, including Abedin's, were hacked in 2013, with data sold by Eastern European hackers. Trump urged an investigation into Abedin, whose emails were recently released, including some from her estranged husband's laptop. These emails were a "sore spot" for Hillary Clinton, as former FBI Director James Comey's disclosure of similar emails before the 2016 election "hurt" her campaign. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, suggesting the sailor hoped for a pardon but was denied. The president's criticism of the Justice Department and his "attacks" on Clinton reflect ongoing tensions.
