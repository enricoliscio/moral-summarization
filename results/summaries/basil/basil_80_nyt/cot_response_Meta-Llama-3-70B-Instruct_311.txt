SUMMARY:
President Trump has continued his attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump called for his administration to investigate Abedin, labeling his own Justice Department a "deep state" and implying that it is a "shadow government" that secretly plots to influence policy. This comes after the State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, which were found on her estranged husband's laptop. Trump also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, implying that the sailor's punishment was unfair. Trump's attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department have been a regular drumbeat since the 2016 presidential election. END OF SUMMARY.
