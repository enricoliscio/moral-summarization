Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Trump accusing a former Clinton aide of not following security protocols. Let me read through the text again to make sure I understand the key points.

First, Trump made a tweet calling the former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, for disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email. He also criticized the Justice Department as the "deep state." The article mentions that this is a familiar tactic for Trump, who has been attacking Clinton and the Justice Department for a while.

The article also explains that Yahoo was hacked in 2013, affecting all accounts, including Abedin's. The data was sold by Eastern European hackers. Trump wants the administration to investigate Abedin, which ties into his narrative of a "deep state" trying to undermine him.

Additionally, there's mention of the State Department releasing some of Abedin's emails found on her estranged husband's laptop. These emails were part of a public records request and were a sensitive topic for Clinton. The article also brings up the Navy sailor case, where the sailor was jailed for taking submarine photos, hoping for a pardon, but hasn't received one.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. That means highlighting Trump's accusations, the context of the hacking, his criticism of the Justice Department, and the political implications for Clinton. I should also mention the released emails and the sailor case briefly.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Trump's tweet and accusation. Then mention the article's details about the password forwarding and the Yahoo hack. Include Trump's use of "deep state" and his call for investigation. Then note the release of emails and their significance. Finally, touch on the Navy sailor case as another example of his focus on security and political opponents.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and includes all key points without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words.
