SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email account, which was later hacked. Trump's Twitter post, his first "Crooked Hillary" attack of the new year, also called his own Justice Department a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy and undercutting democratically elected leaders. The post followed an article in The Daily Caller, which reported on Abedin's breach of security protocols, and Trump implored his administration to investigate Abedin. This continues Trump's regular drumbeat of attacks on Hillary Clinton, his former opponent, more than a year after the election. Emails found on Abedin's estranged husband's laptop have been a sore spot for Clinton, with the former FBI director James Comey's disclosure of their existence potentially impacting the election's outcome. Trump's post also referred to a case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, despite hoping for a presidential pardon.
END OF SUMMARY.
