SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of compromising government passwords by forwarding them to her personal Yahoo email account in 2009. This accusation was based on an article in The Daily Caller, which also claimed that Yahoo was hacked in 2013, potentially compromising Abedin's account. Trump used the term "deep state" to describe his own Justice Department, suggesting a shadow government of agency officials working against him. The State Department recently released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, which were found on her estranged husband's laptop. This incident echoes Hillary Clinton's private email server controversy, which Trump believes cost her the election. Trump also referenced a Fox News report about a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who has not received a presidential pardon.
END OF SUMMARY.
