SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again taken to Twitter to attack his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols. Trump claims Abedin forwarded government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, which was later hacked. He is calling for an investigation into Abedin's actions. This attack is part of a larger pattern of Trump's behavior, where he consistently targets Clinton and the Justice Department, even after 14 months since the election. Trump's actions are a clear example of a lack of graciousness and a refusal to move on from past political battles. Furthermore, his use of the term "deep state" to describe his own Justice Department is a concerning attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democratic institutions. Trump's behavior is a stark reminder of the importance of holding our leaders accountable for their actions and words.

END OF SUMMARY.
