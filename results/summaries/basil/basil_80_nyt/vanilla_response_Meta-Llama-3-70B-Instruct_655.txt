SUMMARY:

President Trump has taken to Twitter to accuse a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump is calling for an investigation into Abedin's actions and is also criticizing his own Justice Department, referring to it as a "deep state." This comes after the State Department released around 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, which were found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Trump's tweet is seen as a continuation of his attacks on Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election. Trump also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, suggesting that he should be pardoned.
