Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Trump accusing Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of not following security protocols. He called the Justice Department the "deep state." The context is that Abedin forwarded government passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all accounts. Trump wants an investigation and mentioned a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, hoping for a pardon but didn't get it.

I should include the key points: Trump's tweet, Abedin's action, the hacking incident, the term "deep state," the released emails, and the mention of the sailor. Also, mention that this is part of Trump's ongoing attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department.

Need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include all main elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step.

First, Trump's accusation and the context of the tweet. Then, what Abedin did and the hacking. Mention the term "deep state" and the released emails. Also, include the sailor's case briefly. Finally, note that this continues Trump's attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all necessary points without unnecessary details. Let me put it together concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He criticized the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and urged an investigation into Abedin. The accusation followed a report in The Daily Caller, which Trump closely monitors. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, affecting all accounts, and the data was later sold. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who hoped for a pardon but did not receive one. The State Department recently released 3,000 of Abedin’s emails, found on her estranged husband’s laptop, as part of a public records request. This incident adds to Trump’s ongoing criticism of Clinton and the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
