SUMMARY: 
In a recent tweet, President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email account in 2009. Trump's tweet, which referred to Abedin as "Crooked Hillary", also criticized his own Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy under his administration. The president has repeatedly attacked Clinton and called for investigations into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. The issue of Abedin's emails resurfaced after the State Department released 3,000 of her work-related messages found on her estranged husband's laptop. Trump's tweet also drew attention to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, expressing disappointment that the sailor had not received a presidential pardon. The president's persistent focus on Clinton and his own Justice Department underscores his willingness to use his platform to pursue political opponents and shape public perception, even after his election victory.
