Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump accusing Huma Abedin of failing to follow security protocols. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article. Let me read through the article again to pick out those words.

The article starts by saying Trump accused a former Clinton aide of "disregarding basic security protocols." So "disregarding" and "protocols" might have moral implications here. Then he calls the Justice Department a "deep state," which is a term that implies a shadowy, conspiratorial group. That's definitely a moral framing.

Next, the article mentions that Trump has been regularly attacking Hillary Clinton, using terms like "Crooked Hillary." "Crooked" is a clear moral judgment. He also criticized the Justice Department and Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations against his political opponents, so "criticized" and "pursuing" might carry some moral weight.

The article talks about the aide forwarding government passwords to a private email, which is a security lapse. "Forwarded," "passwords," "private," and "Yahoo" are more factual, but "disregarding" is already noted. The hacking incident in 2013 affected billions of accounts, so "hacked" and "affected" are more descriptive.

Trump implores his administration to investigate Abedin, so "implores" and "investigate" are actions with moral overtones. The term "deep state" is already noted. The emails were found on Weiner's laptop, and their release is a sore spot for Clinton. "Sore spot" is a metaphor but not a moral word. Comey's disclosure hurt Clinton's campaign, so "hurt" is a moral assessment.

Finally, the article mentions a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures. "Jailed" and "pictures" are factual, but the context implies a moral judgment on the sailor's actions.

So, compiling the morally framed words: Crooked, deep state, disregarding, basic, protocols, hacked, implores, investigate, hurt, jailing.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I should mention Trump's accusations, the security protocols, the deep state reference, the Clinton campaign's hurt, and the sailor's jailing. I'll structure it to flow naturally, making sure to highlight the moral framing without getting bogged down in details.

**SUMMARY:**
President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private email, which was later hacked. He criticized the Justice Department, calling it a "deep state," and urged an investigation into Abedin. The incident, revealed in a conservative publication, resurfaced tensions from the 2016 election, where Trump accused Hillary Clinton of using a private email server. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, implying potential political bias in such cases. The email scandal remains a sore spot for Clinton, with former FBI Director Comey's disclosure seen as damaging her campaign. Trump's continued attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department highlight ongoing political tensions.
