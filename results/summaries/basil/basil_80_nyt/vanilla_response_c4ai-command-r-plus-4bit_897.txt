SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump also criticized the Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials influencing policy. The accusations come after the State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, found on her estranged husband's laptop, in response to a public records request. The emails in question were forwarded before Yahoo was hacked in 2013, compromising all three billion accounts. Trump's tweets also referenced a Fox News report about a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine who has not received a presidential pardon. The attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department continue a pattern of criticism from Trump, who has regularly targeted his former political opponent and government agencies.
END OF SUMMARY.
