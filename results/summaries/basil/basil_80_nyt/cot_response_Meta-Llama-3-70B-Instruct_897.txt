SUMMARY:
President Trump has continued his attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump called for his administration to investigate Abedin, labeling his own Justice Department a "deep state" that secretly plots to influence policy. This comes almost 14 months after the election, with Trump maintaining a regular drumbeat of attacks on Clinton. The Twitter post followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication closely monitored by Trump. The "deep state" term typically refers to a shadow government of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy, often associated with authoritarian elements that undercut democratically elected leaders. Trump's attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department struck familiar tones for the new year. END OF SUMMARY.
