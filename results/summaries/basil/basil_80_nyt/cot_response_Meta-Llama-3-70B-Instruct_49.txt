SUMMARY:
President Trump has continued his attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's tweet also referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state," implying a shadow government plotting against him. The tweet followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication Trump closely monitors. Trump also called for an investigation into Abedin's actions. The emails in question were found on the laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request. Trump's attack on Clinton and her aide is seen as a familiar tone, with Trump having kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Clinton almost 14 months after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
