SUMMARY: 
President Trump accused Hillary Clinton's former aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email account. Trump's tweet, referring to Abedin as "Crooked Hillary", also criticized his own Justice Department as a "deep state," a term that refers to a shadow government of agency officials with authoritarian tendencies. The accusation comes after the State Department released thousands of Abedin's work-related emails found on her estranged husband's laptop, a sore spot for Clinton. Trump's tweet urged his administration to investigate Abedin, continuing his regular attacks on Clinton well over a year after the 2016 election. The president's moral outrage was also directed at the case of an unjustly jailed Navy sailor, who has not received a hoped-for pardon. END OF SUMMARY.
