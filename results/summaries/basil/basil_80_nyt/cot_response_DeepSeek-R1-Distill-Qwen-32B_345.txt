Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Trump accusing Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of not following security protocols. He called the Justice Department the "deep state." I remember that "deep state" is a term implying a hidden group influencing policies, often negatively.

First, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. Let me go through the text. Words like "Crooked," "disregarding," "basic," "deep state," "criticized," "pursuing," "hacked," "shadow government," "secretly plot," "authoritarian," "undercut," "sore spot," "hurt," "momentum," "helped," "jailed," "pardon." These words carry moral connotations, so I'll list them.

Next, I have to write a summary using these words. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of these terms as possible without losing the essence. I'll structure it to show Trump's accusations, the context of the email scandal, and the political implications.

I should start by mentioning Trump's tweet, then the accusation against Abedin, the reference to the deep state, and the ongoing attacks on Clinton. Then, I'll touch on the email release and its impact on Clinton's campaign. Finally, I'll note the sailor's case and the pardon request.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing from the original article. I'll make sure each sentence incorporates the identified words where appropriate without making it seem forced.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it tight and within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and that the moral elements are preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He also criticized his own Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," a term implying a shadow government plotting against democratic leaders. Trump's tweet followed an article in The Daily Caller, which he closely monitors. The accusation reignites the email scandal tied to Hillary Clinton, whose campaign was hurt by the disclosure of her private email server use. The State Department released 3,000 of Abedin’s emails, found on her estranged husband’s laptop, adding to Clinton’s political challenges. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who hoped for a pardon but has yet to receive one. Trump’s ongoing attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department highlight his continued criticism of political opponents.
