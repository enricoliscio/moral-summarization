SUMMARY:

President Trump has accused a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump made the accusation on Twitter, calling for his administration to investigate Abedin. The tweet also referred to the Justice Department as a "deep state" and mentioned the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. The sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president. The tweet is seen as a continuation of Trump's attacks on Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election. The emails in question were found on the laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request. Trump's tweet has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as an attempt to deflect attention from his own administration's controversies.
