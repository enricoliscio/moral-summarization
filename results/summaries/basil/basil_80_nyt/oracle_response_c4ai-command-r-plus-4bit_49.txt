SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her personal email account, which was later hacked. Trump's tweet, his first "Crooked Hillary" post of the new year, also attacked his own Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy. The term "deep state" is typically associated with authoritarian elements that undercut democratically elected leaders. The president's accusations came less than 48 hours into 2018 and follow a long line of attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department for not pursuing investigations into his political opponents. The State Department recently released thousands of Abedin's work-related emails, found on the laptop of her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, further fueling Trump's criticism. The article also mentions Trump's reference to the case of a Navy sailor who took pictures inside a military submarine and did not receive a presidential pardon.
END OF SUMMARY.
