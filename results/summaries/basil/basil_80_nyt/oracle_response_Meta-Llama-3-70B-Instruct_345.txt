SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's Twitter post also took aim at his own Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" that secretly plots to influence policy. This is not the first time Trump has criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents. The article that sparked Trump's tweet revealed that Abedin's emails were found on her estranged husband's laptop and were released as part of a public records request. Trump's attacks on Clinton and her aides have been a regular drumbeat since the 2016 election, and his use of morally charged language, such as "disregarding", "attacking", and "plot", implies a sense of wrongdoing and betrayal.
