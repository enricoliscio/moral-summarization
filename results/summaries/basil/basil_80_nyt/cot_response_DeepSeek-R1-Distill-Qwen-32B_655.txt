Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

First, the article is about Trump accusing Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of failing to follow security protocols. He called the Justice Department a "deep state," which has a negative connotation, implying they're against him. The article mentions that Trump regularly attacks Clinton, which shows his ongoing criticism. He also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not investigating his political opponents, which is another moral criticism.

The article goes on to explain that Abedin forwarded government passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009, and Yahoo was hacked in 2013. The data was sold, which is a security breach. Trump wants an investigation into Abedin, using the term "deep state" again, which is a negative framing.

Then, it talks about the release of Abedin's emails from Weiner's laptop, which is a sore spot for Clinton. Comey's disclosure before the election is mentioned, which Clinton claims hurt her campaign, implying Trump benefited from it. Trump also brings up a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures, hoping for a pardon but not getting one, which might tie into the idea of unfair treatment.

Now, for the moral framing words, I need to identify each single word that carries a moral judgment. Words like "accuses," "disregarding," "failed," "criticized," "deep state," "shadow government," "secretly plot," "undercut," "sore spot," "disclosure," "hurt," "momentum," "helped," "jailed,"
