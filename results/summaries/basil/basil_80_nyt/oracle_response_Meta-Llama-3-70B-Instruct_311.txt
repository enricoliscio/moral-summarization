SUMMARY:

President Trump has resumed his familiar attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's Twitter post also took aim at his own Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" that secretly plots to influence policy. The Daily Caller article that inspired Trump's tweet revealed that Abedin's emails were compromised in the 2013 Yahoo hack, with the stolen data later being sold by a hacking collective. Trump called for an investigation into Abedin's actions, which he claims undermined security protocols. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton, having kept up a regular drumbeat of criticism almost 14 months after the election. Trump's tweet also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, implying that the sailor's punishment was harsher than Abedin's alleged security breach.

END OF SUMMARY.
