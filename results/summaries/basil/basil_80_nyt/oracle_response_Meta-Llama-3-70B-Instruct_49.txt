SUMMARY:

President Trump has launched another attack on his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's Twitter post also took aim at his own Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" that secretly plots to influence policy. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton, with a regular drumbeat of attacks over the past 14 months. The article that sparked Trump's tweet revealed that Abedin's emails were found on her estranged husband's laptop and were released as part of a public records request. Trump's tweet also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, implying that the sailor's punishment was unfair. Trump's language is laced with morally charged terms, including "disregarding", "attacking", "hacked", "breach", and "plot", framing his opponents as reckless and corrupt.

END OF SUMMARY.
