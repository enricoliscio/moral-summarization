SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked his former opponent Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump also referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state," implying that it is working against him. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton, and it's clear that he is still holding onto past grievances. The article highlights Trump's pattern of behavior, where he consistently attacks his political opponents and undermines the credibility of his own administration. This behavior is concerning, as it undermines the democratic process and creates a sense of distrust among citizens. Trump's actions also raise questions about his commitment to fairness and justice, as he seems more interested in settling scores than in governing the country.

END OF SUMMARY.
