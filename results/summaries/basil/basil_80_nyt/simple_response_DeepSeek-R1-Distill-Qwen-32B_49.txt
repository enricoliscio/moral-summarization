Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Trump accusing Huma Abedin of security protocol failures. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should preserve the moral framing from the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Trump is attacking Abedin for forwarding government passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, and the data was sold. He's calling the Justice Department the "deep state," which refers to a shadow government influencing policy.

I should include Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and his ongoing attacks against Hillary Clinton. Also, mention the release of Abedin's emails and their impact on Clinton's campaign. The mention of the Navy sailor adds context about Trump's pardons.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral implications, like Trump's criticism of the "deep state" and the potential misuse of information. I'll make sure to highlight the ongoing tension and the political implications without going into too much detail.

Now, I'll structure the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all necessary points while maintaining the moral framing. I'll start with Trump's accusation, then move to the context of the hack, his criticism of the Justice Department, the release of emails, and the mention of the sailor. Finally, I'll note the ongoing political tension.

Let me check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. I think I've covered all the essential points without exceeding the word limit. The summary should now accurately reflect the article while preserving the moral aspects presented by the author.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused former Clinton aide Huma Abedin of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He criticized the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and urged an investigation into Abedin. The accusation followed a report in The Daily Caller, which Trump closely monitors. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, with data sold by Eastern European hackers. Trump's tweet also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, hinting at a possible pardon. The State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's work emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails were previously cited by former FBI Director James Comey, whose disclosure reportedly harmed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Trump's continued attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department highlight ongoing political tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
