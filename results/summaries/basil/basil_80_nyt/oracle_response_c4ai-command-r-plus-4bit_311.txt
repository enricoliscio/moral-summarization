SUMMARY: President Trump accuses Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her personal email account, which was later hacked. Trump's accusation is based on an article published by The Daily Caller, and he uses this to attack Hillary Clinton once again and criticize his own Justice Department, referring to it as a "deep state." This term, "deep state," implies the existence of a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy and undercutting democratically elected leaders. Trump's Twitter post also mentions the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine but has not received a presidential pardon. Hillary Clinton previously faced scrutiny for her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, and Abedin's emails were discovered on her husband's laptop. The release of these emails as part of a public records request continues to be a sore spot for Clinton, who believes it contributed to her election loss. Trump's accusations and attacks on his political opponents, including Clinton and the Justice Department, persist well over a year after the 2016 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
