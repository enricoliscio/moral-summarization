SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's tweet came shortly after a similar article was published by The Daily Caller, and he urged his administration to investigate Abedin. The incident in question occurred when Abedin forwarded government passwords to her Yahoo email account, which was later hacked in 2013, compromising all three billion accounts. Trump also criticized the Justice Department, referring to it as a "deep state," and brought up the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine but did not receive a presidential pardon. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton; he has consistently criticized her, even more than a year after the 2016 election. The recent release of Abedin's work-related emails found on her husband's laptop has brought the issue back into the spotlight, with Clinton blaming the FBI's handling of the situation for her election loss.
END OF SUMMARY.
