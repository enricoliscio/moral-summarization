Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Trump accusing a former Clinton aide. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by saying Trump made a Twitter post about Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, for not following security protocols. He called the Justice Department a "deep state." I should note that "deep state" refers to a shadow government, which is a term often used in authoritarian contexts.

Then, the article mentions that this attack is familiar, as Trump has been consistently attacking Hillary Clinton since the election. Last year, he criticized the Justice Department and Jeff Sessions for not investigating his political opponents. 

The source of this Twitter post was an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative outlet Trump follows. The article said Abedin forwarded government passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009 when Clinton was Secretary of State. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, affecting 3 billion accounts, and the data was sold by a hacking group in Eastern Europe.

Trump is urging his administration to investigate Abedin. The State Department released some of her emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails are a sensitive issue for Clinton because the FBI's Comey had notified Congress about potentially relevant emails before the 2016 election, which Clinton believes hurt her campaign.

Additionally, Trump mentioned a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, hoping for a pardon but not receiving one.

So, the summary needs to include Trump's accusation, the source (Daily Caller), the details about the email and hacking, the reference to the deep state, the released emails, their relevance to Clinton, and the mention of the sailor.

I should make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include all key points without getting too detailed. Also, structure it in clear, concise sentences.

Let me draft the summary:

"President Trump accused former Clinton aide Huma Abedin of disregarding security protocols, claiming she forwarded government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He criticized the Justice Department as part of the 'deep state.' The accusation, based on a Daily Caller article, comes amid ongoing tensions between Trump and Clinton. Yahoo's 2013 hack exposed her data. Trump called for an investigation, while the State Department released some of Abedin's emails, found on her estranged husband's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails are significant due to the FBI's pre-election disclosure, which Clinton claims impacted her campaign. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for submarine photos, who sought a pardon."

Wait, that's a bit over. Let me trim it down, ensuring all key points are included without redundancy.

Final version:
