Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump accusing Huma Abedin of failing to follow security protocols. The user also wants me to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

First, Trump made a Twitter post calling Huma Abedin out for sending government passwords to her private email in 2009 when Clinton was Secretary of State. He also criticized the Justice Department as the "deep state." The article mentions that Yahoo was hacked in 2013, affecting all accounts, and the data was sold. Trump wants an investigation into Abedin. The term "deep state" refers to a shadow government, which is a negative framing. 

Also, the State Department released some of Abedin's emails found on Weiner's laptop, which is a sensitive point for Clinton. Comey's disclosure before the 2016 election hurt Clinton's campaign, according to her. Trump also mentioned a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures, hoping for a pardon but didn't get it.

So, the summary needs to include Trump's accusation, the context of the email security, the hacking incident, the reference to the deep state, the release of emails, the impact on Clinton, and the sailor's case. I should keep it under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I should highlight Trump's criticism of Clinton and the Justice Department, the security lapse, and the ongoing political tension. Also, mention the released emails and their significance.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's accusation, mention the security protocols and Yahoo hack, reference the deep state, the released emails and their context, and the sailor's case. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I think that's all. Time to put it together.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He also criticized the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," a term often associated with shadowy government influence. The accusation followed an article in The Daily Caller, which Trump closely monitors, and came just days after the State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Trump's tweet referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, hinting at a double standard in accountability. The situation highlights ongoing political tensions, with Trump continuing to attack Clinton and her associates, while Clinton has blamed Trump's election win on Comey's email disclosure. END OF SUMMARY.
