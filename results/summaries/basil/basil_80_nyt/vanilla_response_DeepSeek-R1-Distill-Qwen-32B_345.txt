Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Trump accusing a former Clinton aide. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article says that Trump tweeted about Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, for forwarding government passwords to her private email in 2009. He called this a failure to follow security protocols and criticized the Justice Department as the "deep state." The article mentions that Yahoo was hacked in 2013, affecting all accounts, including Abedin's. Trump is urging an investigation into her.

Also, the State Department released some of Abedin's emails from Weiner's laptop, which were part of public records. These emails were a point of contention during the 2016 election. Trump also brought up a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, hoping for a pardon but didn't get it.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's tweet, mention Abedin's action, the hacking incident, and Trump's criticism of the Justice Department. Then, include the release of emails and their significance. Finally, mention the sailor case briefly.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step to cover each key element succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized former Clinton aide Huma Abedin for allegedly forwarding government passwords to her private email in 2009, calling her actions a failure to follow security protocols. He also accused the Justice Department of being part of the "deep state," a term referring to a shadow government influencing policy. The criticism followed a report in The Daily Caller, which Trump closely monitors, noting that Yahoo was hacked in 2013, potentially exposing Abedin's accounts. Trump urged an investigation into her actions. The State Department recently released 3,000 of Abedin's work emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails were a point of contention during the 2016 election, with former FBI Director James Comey notifying Congress about their existence. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who had hoped for a pardon but was unsuccessful. END OF SUMMARY.
