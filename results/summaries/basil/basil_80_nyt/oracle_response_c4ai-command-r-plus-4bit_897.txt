SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of "disregarding basic security protocols," in a recent Twitter post. Trump's accusation was based on an article in The Daily Caller, which claimed that Abedin forwarded government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account in 2009 while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. The article also mentioned the hacking of Yahoo in 2013 and the subsequent sale of data by a hacking collective. Trump's use of the term "deep state" to refer to his own Justice Department suggests a belief in a shadow government of agency officials plotting to "influence" policy and "undercut" democratically elected leaders. This continues a pattern of "attacks" by Trump on Clinton and the Justice Department, with Trump criticizing the department for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents. The release of Abedin's emails by the State Department and the mention of James Comey's disclosure about Clinton's private email server also highlight the ongoing scrutiny of Clinton's email practices. Trump's Twitter post also brought attention to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, potentially seeking a pardon.
END OF SUMMARY.
