SUMMARY:
President Trump has continued his attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's tweet also referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state," implying a shadow government of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy. This comes almost 14 months after the election, with Trump maintaining a regular drumbeat of attacks on Clinton. The tweet followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication closely monitored by Trump. Trump also called for an investigation into Abedin's actions, which he deemed a "crooked" move. The emails found on Abedin's husband's laptop are a "sore spot" for Clinton, who believes that James Comey's disclosure of the emails before the 2016 election "hurt" her campaign's momentum and helped Trump win.
END OF SUMMARY.
