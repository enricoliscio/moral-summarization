SUMMARY: President Trump takes to Twitter to accuse Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding security protocols, in a familiar tone of attacking his political opponents. The accusation comes after The Daily Caller reported that Abedin forwarded government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account, which was hacked in 2013. Trump also criticizes his own Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials influencing policy. This is not the first time Trump has targeted Hillary Clinton and her aides, with previous criticisms directed towards the Justice Department for not pursuing investigations. The release of Abedin's work-related emails found on her husband's laptop further fuels Trump's accusations. In his Twitter post, Trump also refers to the case of a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, who has not received a pardon despite expectations. Trump's persistent focus on Clinton and her aides, even over a year after the election, showcases a moral dilemma of ethical leadership and the responsible use of power. It raises questions about the ethical boundaries of political attacks and the potential abuse of power by a democratically elected leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
