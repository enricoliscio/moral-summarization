Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is accusing Huma Abedin of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email. He called the Justice Department a "deep state." The article mentions that Yahoo was hacked, leading to a data breach sold on the dark web. Trump is attacking Clinton again, which is a recurring theme. The emails were found on Weiner's laptop and released by the State Department. The sailor's case is also mentioned as another point of contention.

I need to make sure the summary includes the listed moral words: disregarding, calling, attacking, attacks, hacked, breach, sale, plot, influence, undercut, taking. I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's accusations, the security issues, and the political implications. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including all necessary points.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused former Clinton aide Huma Abedin of "disregarding basic security protocols" for forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He also "called" his Justice Department a "deep state," accusing it of failing to investigate his political opponents. This latest attack on Hillary Clinton, a familiar theme, followed a report in The Daily Caller, a publication Trump closely monitors. The article revealed that Yahoo was "hacked" in 2013, with the breach data later "sold" by a hacking group. Trump urged his administration to "investigate" Abedin, framing the Justice Department as part of a shadowy "plot" to "influence" policy against democratically elected leaders. The State Department recently released 3,000 of Abedin’s work emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails remain a sensitive issue for Clinton, who previously criticized former FBI Director James Comey for disclosing potentially relevant emails before the 2016 election, which she claimed "undercut" her campaign. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, suggesting the sailor hoped for a pardon but has yet to receive one. END OF SUMMARY.
