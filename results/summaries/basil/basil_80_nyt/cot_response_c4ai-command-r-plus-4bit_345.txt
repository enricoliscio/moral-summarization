SUMMARY: In a recent Twitter post, President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private email account. Trump's use of the term "deep state" and his criticism of the Justice Department imply a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy, undercutting democratically elected leaders. The tweet came less than 48 hours into the new year and marks Trump's first "Crooked Hillary" post of 2018, continuing his regular attacks on his former opponent. The post was prompted by an article in The Daily Caller, which reported on Abedin's email practices while Clinton was secretary of state. Emails from Abedin's estranged husband's laptop were released by the State Department and revealed sensitive information, including passwords. Trump also referenced a case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine and had hoped for a presidential pardon. The tweet reflects Trump's continued focus on Clinton's email scandal and his desire for investigations into his political opponents. END OF SUMMARY.
