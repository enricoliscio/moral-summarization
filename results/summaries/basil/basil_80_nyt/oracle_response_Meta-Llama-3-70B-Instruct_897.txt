SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again taken to Twitter to attack his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's tweet also referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state," implying a shadow government that secretly plots to influence policy and undercut democratically elected leaders. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton, having kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on her over the past 14 months. The Twitter post followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Trump closely monitors, which reported on the email breach. Trump also implored his administration to investigate Abedin, further fueling the attacks on Clinton's campaign. The emails found on Abedin's husband's laptop are a sore spot for Clinton, who blames former F.B.I. director James Comey's disclosure of the emails for hurting her campaign's momentum and helping Trump win the election.
