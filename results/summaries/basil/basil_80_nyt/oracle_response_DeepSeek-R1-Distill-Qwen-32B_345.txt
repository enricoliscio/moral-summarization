Okay, so I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump accusing Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, and the data was sold. Trump called the Justice Department the "deep state" and attacked Clinton again. The article also mentions the release of Abedin's emails and the sailor pardon case.

Now, I need to incorporate the moral words: disregarding, calling, attacking, attacks, hacked, breach, sale, plot, influence, undercut, taking. I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. I'll start with Trump's accusation, use "disregarding" and "calling." Then mention the hacking details with "hacked," "breach," and "sale." Include his attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department, using "attacking" and "attacks." Explain the "deep state" reference, and touch on the email release and the sailor case, using "taking." 

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but ensure all key points are covered with the moral framing intact. Let me draft the summary, making sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused former Clinton aide Huma Abedin of "disregarding basic security protocols" after it was revealed she forwarded government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, with the breach data later sold by Eastern European hackers. Trump also "called" his Justice Department the "deep state," a term implying a shadow government plotting to influence policy. This attack on Clinton and the Justice Department continued Trump's pattern of "attacks" on his political opponents. The State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's work emails, found on her estranged husband's laptop, as part of a public records request. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures inside a submarine, who hoped for a pardon but was denied. END OF SUMMARY.
