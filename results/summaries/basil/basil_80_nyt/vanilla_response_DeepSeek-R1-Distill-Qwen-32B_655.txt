Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Trump's recent Twitter post. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of not following security protocols. He mentioned that she forwarded government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, and the data was sold. Trump is calling the Justice Department the "deep state," which refers to a shadow government influencing policy.

The article also mentions that the State Department released some of Abedin's emails from Weiner's laptop as part of a public records request. These emails were a problem for Clinton because Comey had informed Congress about them before the 2016 election, which Clinton believes affected her campaign.

Additionally, Trump brought up a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking submarine photos, hoping for a pardon but hasn't received one.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's accusation, mention the email issue, the hacking, and the term "deep state." Then, include the released emails and their impact on Clinton. Finally, touch on the sailor's case briefly.

Let me structure it: Trump accuses Abedin, details the email security issue, references the hacking, criticizes the Justice Department, mentions the released emails and their significance, and the sailor's pardon request.

I should ensure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, and the data was sold. Trump criticized the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and urged an investigation into Abedin. The State Department released 3,000 of Abedin's emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails were a point of contention during the 2016 election, as former FBI Director James Comey had notified Congress about their existence, potentially impacting Clinton's campaign. Trump also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who hoped for a pardon but has yet to receive one. END OF SUMMARY.
