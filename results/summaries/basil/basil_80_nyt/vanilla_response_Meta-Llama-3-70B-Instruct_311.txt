SUMMARY:

President Trump accused a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump called for an investigation into Abedin's actions and referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state." The accusation follows an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Trump closely monitors. The article revealed that Abedin's emails were released as part of a public records request, including 3,000 work-related emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Trump also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, suggesting he should receive a pardon. The president's tweets continue his pattern of attacking Hillary Clinton and the Justice Department, which he has criticized for not pursuing investigations into his political opponents.

END OF SUMMARY.
