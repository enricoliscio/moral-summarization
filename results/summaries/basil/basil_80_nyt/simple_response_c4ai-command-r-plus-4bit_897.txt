SUMMARY: President Trump, in his first "Crooked Hillary" Twitter post of the new year, accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email account. Trump also criticized his own Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials secretly plotting to influence policy. The president's accusations come after the State Department released about 3,000 of Ms. Abedin's work-related emails, which were found on the laptop of her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. The discovery of these emails on Mr. Weiner's computer was damaging to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, as it led to an F.B.I. investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. In his tweet, Trump also referenced a case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, expressing disappointment that the sailor had not received a presidential pardon. Trump's continued attacks on Clinton and his own Justice Department raise concerns about his commitment to ethical governance and the rule of law, especially given his use of the derogatory term "Crooked Hillary" and his characterization of the Justice Department as a "deep state."
END OF SUMMARY.
