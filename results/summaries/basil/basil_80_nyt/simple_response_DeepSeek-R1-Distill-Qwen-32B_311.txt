Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Trump accusing Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of failing to follow security protocols. He mentions that she forwarded government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all accounts, and the data was sold. Trump called the Justice Department the "deep state," which refers to a shadow government influencing policy. He also mentioned a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine pictures, hoping for a pardon but didn't get one.

The author's moral framing seems to present Trump as continuing his attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department, using the Abedin case to criticize the "deep state." There's a contrast between Trump's criticism of others and his own administration's actions, like the sailor's pardon not happening.

I should highlight Trump's accusations, the context of the email scandal, the "deep state" reference, and the comparison with the sailor. Also, note that the emails were released as part of a public records request and how this ties into the 2016 election.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects without adding my own bias. I'll structure it by mentioning Trump's tweet, the details about Abedin, the hacking incident, the "deep state" comment, the released emails, and the sailor's case. Also, include that Trump is continuing his attacks on Clinton and the Justice Department, tying it back to the election.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. This followed Yahoo's 2013 hack, where data was sold. Trump criticized the Justice Department as the "deep state," a term implying a shadow government influencing policy. He also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who hoped for a pardon but didn't receive one. The State Department released Abedin's emails, found on her estranged husband's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails were previously mentioned by Comey before the 2016 election, impacting Clinton's campaign. Trump's tweet continued his pattern of attacking Clinton and the Justice Department, tying into the ongoing narrative of the 2016 election. END OF SUMMARY.
