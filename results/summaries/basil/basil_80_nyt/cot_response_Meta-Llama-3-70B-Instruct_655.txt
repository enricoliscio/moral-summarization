SUMMARY:
President Trump has continued his attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump called for an investigation into Abedin's actions, labeling his own Justice Department a "deep state" and implying that it is a "shadow government" of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy. The President's Twitter post followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication he closely monitors. Trump also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, implying that the sailor's punishment was unfair compared to Abedin's actions. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton, having kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on his former Democratic opponent for almost 14 months after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
