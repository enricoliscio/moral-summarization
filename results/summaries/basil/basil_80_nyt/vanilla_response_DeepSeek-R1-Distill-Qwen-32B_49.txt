Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump accusing a former Clinton aide. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Trump made a Twitter post about Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, saying she didn't follow security protocols by sending government passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which is a big deal because all accounts were affected. Trump also called the Justice Department a "deep state," which refers to a shadow government, usually in authoritarian contexts. He's been attacking Clinton and the Justice Department regularly, even before. The article mentions that the State Department released some of Abedin's emails from her estranged husband's laptop, which was a point of contention during the 2016 election. Comey's disclosure about the emails hurt Clinton's campaign, according to her. Trump also brought up a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures, hoping for a pardon but didn't get one.

So, the key points are: Trump's tweet about Abedin, the security issue with Yahoo, the term "deep state," the email release, and the sailor's case. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words.

I'll start with Trump's accusation, mention the security protocols and Yahoo hack, then touch on the Justice Department and "deep state." Include the release of emails and their impact on Clinton. Also, mention the sailor as an additional point in Trump's tweet. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email in 2009. He also criticized the Justice Department, calling it a "deep state," and urged an investigation into Abedin. The State Department released 3,000 of her work emails, found on her estranged husband's laptop, as part of a public records request. These emails were a key issue during the 2016 election, as former FBI Director James Comey disclosed their existence before the election, impacting Clinton's campaign. Trump's tweet also referenced a Navy sailor jailed for taking submarine photos, who hoped for a pardon but did not receive one. END OF SUMMARY.
