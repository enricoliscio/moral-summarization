SUMMARY:

President Trump has continued his attacks on Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump's Twitter post also labeled his own Justice Department a "deep state," implying a shadow government that secretly plots to influence policy and undercut democratically elected leaders. The article in The Daily Caller, which Trump closely monitors, revealed that Abedin's emails were hacked in 2013 and offered for sale by a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe. Trump called for an investigation into Abedin's actions, which he claims were a breach of security protocols. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton, having kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on her for almost 14 months after the election. Trump's post also referenced the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine, implying that the sailor was unfairly punished.

END OF SUMMARY.
