SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump also criticized the Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials influencing policy. The accusations come after the State Department released thousands of Abedin's work-related emails found on her husband's laptop, a discovery that had impacted Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's tweet also referenced a Fox News report about a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine who has not received a presidential pardon.

END OF SUMMARY.
