SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked his former opponent Hillary Clinton, accusing a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump also referred to the Justice Department as a "deep state" and called for an investigation into Abedin. This attack is part of a familiar pattern of Trump's behavior, as he has consistently criticized Clinton and the Justice Department for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents. The article that sparked Trump's tweet was from The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Trump closely monitors. Trump's actions demonstrate a lack of respect for democratic institutions and a willingness to use conspiracy theories to attack his political opponents. This behavior is morally reprehensible and undermines the integrity of the presidency.

END OF SUMMARY.
