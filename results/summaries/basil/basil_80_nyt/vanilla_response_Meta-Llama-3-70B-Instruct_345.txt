SUMMARY:

President Trump has accused a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009. Trump made the accusation on Twitter, citing an article in The Daily Caller, and called for an investigation into Abedin's actions. The President also referred to his own Justice Department as a "deep state" and brought up the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic opponent, and the Justice Department. The emails in question were found on the laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request. The controversy surrounding these emails has been a sore spot for Clinton, who has blamed former FBI Director James Comey's disclosure of the emails for hurting her campaign's momentum and helping Trump win the election.
