SUMMARY: President Trump accused Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of "disregarding basic security protocols" by forwarding government passwords to her personal email account in 2009, which was later hacked. He also attacked Hillary Clinton and criticized his own Justice Department, referring to it as a "deep state." The term "deep state" suggests a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy and undercutting democratically elected leaders. Trump's tweet was prompted by an article in The Daily Caller, which revealed Abedin's actions. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton or his Justice Department, and he continues to call for investigations into his political opponents. Abedin's emails were found on her estranged husband's laptop and released by the State Department in response to a public records request. The incident has drawn attention to the issue of Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state, which was previously investigated by the FBI. Trump's tweet also mentioned a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine and had hoped for a pardon from the president.
END OF SUMMARY.
