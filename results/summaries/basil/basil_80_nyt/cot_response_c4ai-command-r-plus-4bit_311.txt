SUMMARY:
President Trump accused Hillary Clinton's former aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding basic security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email account in 2009. This is part of a regular pattern of attacks on Clinton and her associates by Trump, who has also criticized his own Justice Department as a "deep state," a term referring to a shadow government of agency officials with authoritarian tendencies that undercut democratically elected leaders. The accusation against Abedin was based on an article in The Daily Caller, which revealed that her emails were found on her estranged husband's laptop and released by the State Department. This incident brings up the sore spot of Clinton's private email server investigation, which Trump believes hurt her campaign and helped him win the 2016 election. Trump's Twitter post also highlighted the case of an unjustly jailed Navy sailor who remains unpardoned. END OF SUMMARY.
