SUMMARY: President Trump accuses Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding basic security protocols, in a Twitter post referring to an article in The Daily Caller. The article alleges that Abedin forwarded government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked in 2013. Trump's use of the term "deep state" to describe his own Justice Department suggests a belief in a shadow government of agency officials working against him. The State Department recently released 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails, which were found on her estranged husband's laptop and have been a source of controversy for Hillary Clinton. Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and his attacks on Clinton continue into the new year, with this being the first "Crooked Hillary" Twitter post of 2018. Despite the serious allegations, Trump's own administration has been criticized for its handling of sensitive information and potential conflicts of interest. Trump's focus on the alleged misdeeds of his political opponents raises questions about his commitment to ethical governance and equal justice under the law.
