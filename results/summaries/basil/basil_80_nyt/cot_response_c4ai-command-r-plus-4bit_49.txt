SUMMARY: 
President Trump took to Twitter to accuse Hillary Clinton's former aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email account. The incident, which took place in 2009 when Clinton was Secretary of State, was brought to light by a conservative publication, The Daily Caller. Trump's tweet also criticized his own Justice Department as a "deep state," suggesting a shadow government of agency officials plotting to influence policy. The incident with Abedin's emails, discovered on her estranged husband's laptop, was a sore spot for Clinton, who claimed that the FBI director's disclosure of the issue hurt her campaign and helped Trump win the 2016 election. Trump's tweet urged his administration to investigate Abedin's actions, demonstrating his continued focus on attacking his former political opponent.
END OF SUMMARY.
