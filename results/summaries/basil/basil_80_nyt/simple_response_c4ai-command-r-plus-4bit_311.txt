SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to accuse Huma Abedin, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, of compromising national security by forwarding government passwords to her personal Yahoo email account, which was hacked in 2013. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Clinton and her associates, with previous criticisms including the Justice Department's lack of investigation into Clinton's private email server. The term "deep state" was used by Trump to describe his own Justice Department, suggesting a shadow government of agency officials working against him. The State Department recently released thousands of Abedin's work-related emails, found on her estranged husband's laptop, further fueling Trump's criticism. This incident highlights the ongoing scrutiny of Clinton's email practices during her time as secretary of state and raises concerns about the handling of sensitive government information. Trump's reference to the case of a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine underscores his focus on national security and the enforcement of laws. Trump's actions demonstrate his continued interest in pursuing investigations into his political opponents and those he believes have compromised national security.
END OF SUMMARY.
