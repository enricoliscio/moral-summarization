Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral words used.

The article is about Trump accusing Huma Abedin, a former Clinton aide, of disregarding security protocols by forwarding government passwords to her private email. He called his Justice Department the "deep state." The author used words like "disregarding," "calling," "attacking," "attacks," "hacked," "breach," "sale," "plot," "influence," "undercut," and "taking." I need to include as many of these as possible.

So, the main points are:
1. Trump accused Abedin of disregarding security by sending passwords to her Yahoo email in 2009.
2. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, and the data was sold.
3. Trump called his Justice Department a "deep state," implying a shadow government plotting against him.
4. He attacked Clinton again, continuing his criticisms.
5. The State Department released Abedin's emails, which were found on Weiner's laptop.
6. Comey's disclosure of emails hurt Clinton's campaign, helping Trump win.
7. Trump also mentioned a Navy sailor jailed for taking pictures, hoping for a pardon but not getting one.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral terms. I'll structure it to highlight Trump's accusations, the security breach, the deep state reference, and the ongoing attacks on Clinton. I'll make sure to include all the key moral words where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.
