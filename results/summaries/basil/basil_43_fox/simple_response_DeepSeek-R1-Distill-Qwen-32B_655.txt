Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Bruce Braley mocking Chuck Grassley. First, I should identify the key points: Braley made a derogatory remark about Grassley's background, apologized, but the context is important. The moral angle here is about respect and appropriateness in political discourse.

I should start by stating that Braley is under fire for mocking Grassley. Mention the video and the context of the fundraiser. Then, include his apology and his support for farmers. It's important to note the PAC that released the video and the purpose behind it.

Next, explain the contrast Braley made between himself and Grassley, highlighting the experience aspect. Then, include Grassley's spokesperson's response, questioning Braley's eligibility and emphasizing Grassley's qualifications and background.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral implications of the remarks and the subsequent backlash. I should avoid any bias and present both sides fairly, showing the exchange between Braley and Grassley's camp.

Make sure to include that the spokesperson pointed out the inconsistency in Braley's argument, which adds depth to the moral framing. Also, mention Grassley's experience as a farmer and his work in the Senate to show the contrast.

Finally, wrap it up by highlighting the ongoing debate about qualifications and respect in politics. That should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video emerged where he mocked Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, by referring to him as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during a campaign event. Braley, who is running for the Senate, apologized, stating he respects Iowa farmers and Grassley. The video, released by a conservative PAC, showed Braley speaking to lawyers, contrasting his legal background with Grassley's lack of legal experience. Braley suggested that if elected, he would bring legal expertise to the Senate Judiciary Committee, implying Grassley, as a farmer without a legal background, was unfit for the role. Grassley's spokesperson countered, questioning Braley's eligibility to discuss agricultural and other policies, given his legal background, and highlighted Grassley's "Iowa common sense" and extensive Senate record. The exchange underscores tensions over qualifications and respect in political discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
