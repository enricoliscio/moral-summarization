SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash and accusations of mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a respected Republican and farmer from Iowa. In a video released by a conservative super PAC, Braley is seen asking for help in his campaign for Senate, disrespectfully dismissing Grassley as a "farmer who never went to law school." Braley, a trial lawyer, suggested that his own background and experience in fighting tort reform for thirty years made him a more suitable candidate for the Senate Judiciary Committee. However, a spokesperson for Grassley fired back, defending the senator's strong record on the judiciary committee and highlighting his valuable contributions to various policy areas, including agriculture and energy. Braley has since apologized for his remarks, expressing his respect for Iowa farmers and Grassley's work.

END OF SUMMARY.
