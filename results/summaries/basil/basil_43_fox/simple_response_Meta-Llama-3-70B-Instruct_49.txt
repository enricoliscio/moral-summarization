SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley made the comment while speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, implying that Grassley's lack of a law degree makes him unqualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley apologized for the remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, his apology rings hollow, as his initial comment reveals a condescending attitude towards those without a law degree. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, pointing out that by Braley's logic, he himself would be unqualified to speak on policy issues like agriculture and healthcare. The incident highlights the importance of humility and respect for others' experiences and backgrounds.

END OF SUMMARY.
