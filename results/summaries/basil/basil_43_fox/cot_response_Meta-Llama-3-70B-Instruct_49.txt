SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" in a video that surfaced Tuesday. Braley apologized, saying he has "tremendous respect" for Iowa farmers and appreciates their importance to the state. He proclaimed his support for Iowa's farmers, saying he's "grateful" to have their backing. The video shows Braley speaking to lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, where he highlighted the contrast between himself, a trial lawyer, and Grassley, a farmer, serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, touting Grassley's "strong record" on the committee and his ability to bring "common sense" to policy issues. The controversy has sparked a heated debate about who is best suited to serve on the committee. END OF SUMMARY.
