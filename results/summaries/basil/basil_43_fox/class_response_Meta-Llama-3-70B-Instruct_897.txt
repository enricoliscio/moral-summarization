SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley apologized for his remarks, saying he "respects" Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, his initial comments were meant to contrast his own background as a trial lawyer with Grassley's lack of legal experience. Braley argued that if elected, he would "fight" for tort reform on the Senate Judiciary Committee, whereas Grassley, as a "farmer," would not have the necessary expertise. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, suggesting that by Braley's logic, his own background as a trial lawyer would disqualify him from speaking on policy issues like agriculture and health care. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his unique perspective as a working family farmer.
