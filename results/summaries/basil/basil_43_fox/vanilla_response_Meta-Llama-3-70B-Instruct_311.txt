SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during a fundraiser in Texas. Braley apologized for the remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. The video shows Braley speaking to a group of lawyers, saying that if elected to the Senate, he would want to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but if Republicans take the Senate, Grassley would likely become chairman. Braley implied that Grassley's lack of a law degree makes him less qualified for the role. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, saying that by Braley's logic, he as a trial lawyer would not be eligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture and health care. The spokesperson touted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his experience as a working family farmer.

END OF SUMMARY.
