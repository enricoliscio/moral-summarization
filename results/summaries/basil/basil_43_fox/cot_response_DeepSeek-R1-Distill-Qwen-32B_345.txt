Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down what the user is asking for. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "fire," "mocking," "apologized," "respect," "support," "grateful," "campaign," "replace," "fighting," "tort reform," "background," "experience," "voice," "eligible," "strong record," "common sense," "works," "all of America." I'll list these under STEP 1.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the main event: Rep. Bruce Braley mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley. Then, I'll include his apology and the context of the fundraiser. I'll note Grassley's spokesperson's response, highlighting Grassley's qualifications and the attack on Braley's logic. Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the ongoing debate about qualifications and representation.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key points while maintaining the moral elements. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and concise, sticking to the word limit. Let me put it all together now.

**SUMMARY:**  
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced backlash after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, calling him a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during his Senate campaign. Braley apologized, stating he "respects" Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video, released by conservative super PAC America Rising, showed Braley speaking at a Texas fundraiser, where he contrasted his legal background with Grassley's lack of legal experience, implying Grassley might chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley's spokesperson criticized Braley's logic, arguing that as a trial lawyer, Braley wouldn't be "eligible" to speak on agriculture or health care. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his role as a "working family farmer" bringing "Iowa common sense" to policy. The exchange highlights the ongoing debate over qualifications and representation in politics.
