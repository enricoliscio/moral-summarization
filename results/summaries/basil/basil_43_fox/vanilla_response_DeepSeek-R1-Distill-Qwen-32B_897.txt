Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Bruce Braley and Chuck Grassley. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article starts by mentioning that Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video where he mocks Sen. Chuck Grassley. The context is Braley's campaign for the Senate in Iowa, which is known for its agriculture industry. In the video, Braley refers to Grassley as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." 

Braley then apologized, stating he respects Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video was posted by a conservative super PAC called America Rising, showing Braley speaking to lawyers at a Texas fundraiser. Braley mentioned wanting to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee if elected, contrasting his background with Grassley's.

Grassley's spokesperson responded, pointing out that if Braley's logic holds, as a trial lawyer, he wouldn't be eligible to speak on issues like agriculture. They also highlighted Grassley's strong record on the Judiciary Committee and his background as a working farmer.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: Braley's remarks, his apology, the context of the fundraiser, the contrast between their backgrounds, and Grassley's response.

I should structure it to first mention Braley's comments, then his apology, followed by the details of the fundraiser and his campaign goals. Then, include Grassley's spokesperson's rebuttal and Grassley's qualifications.

I should ensure the summary is concise, clear, and captures all essential elements without getting too detailed. Also, make sure to mention that the video was released by a conservative PAC and the implications of their backgrounds on the Judiciary Committee.

Let me put it all together, making sure it flows logically and stays within the word limit.
