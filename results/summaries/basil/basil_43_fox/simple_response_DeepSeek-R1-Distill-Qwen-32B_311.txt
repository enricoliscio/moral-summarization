Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley who's facing criticism after a video where he mocks Sen. Chuck Grassley. He called Grassley a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." This happened during his campaign for Senate in a state known for agriculture. Braley later apologized, saying he respects Grassley and supports Iowa farmers. The video was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising, and shows Braley speaking at a fundraiser with lawyers in Texas.

Braley mentioned that if elected, he'd want to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee but noted Grassley might become chairman if Republicans win. He contrasted his legal background with Grassley's lack thereof. Grassley's spokesperson responded, pointing out that Braley, as a trial lawyer, shouldn't speak on certain policies and highlighted Grassley's experience and background as a farmer.

So, the moral framing here is about respect and appropriateness in political discourse. Braley apologized, showing he respects farmers, but his initial remark was seen as disrespectful. Grassley's team countered by questioning Braley's qualifications to discuss non-law-related issues, emphasizing Grassley's expertise.

I need to make sure the summary captures this dynamic: Braley's criticism, his apology, Grassley's counter, and the underlying themes of respect and qualifications in politics. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.
