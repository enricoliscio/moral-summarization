Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible: respects, respect, appreciate, grateful, support, help, fighting, work, works.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Bruce Braley mocking Chuck Grassley during a campaign event. Braley apologized, emphasizing respect for Iowa farmers and their importance. The video was released by a conservative PAC, showing Braley speaking to lawyers in Texas. Braley mentioned wanting to serve on the Judiciary Committee but noted Grassley might become chairman. He contrasted his background with Grassley's, implying Grassley lacks legal experience. Grassley's spokesperson criticized this, pointing out Grassley's strong record and his role as a farmer senator.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral words. I'll start by mentioning Braley's remarks and his apology, using "respects" and "grateful." Then, I'll note the context of the fundraiser and his campaign goal, using "support." I'll include his comparison with Grassley, using "fighting" for his experience. Grassley's response will highlight his "work" and "works" for Iowa.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, maintaining the moral tone. I'll check word count to stay within limits. Finally, I'll format it with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video surfaced where he mocked Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, by calling him a “farmer from Iowa who never went to law school” during his Senate campaign. Braley apologized, stating he “respects” Grassley and “appreciates” the importance of Iowa’s farmers, for whom he is “grateful.” The video, released by a conservative PAC, showed Braley speaking to lawyers in Texas, where he highlighted his legal background and contrasted it with Grassley’s lack of legal experience. Braley emphasized his desire to “fight” for tort reform and serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, suggesting Grassley, as a farmer, might not be the best fit for the role. Grassley’s spokesperson countered, arguing that Braley’s logic would disqualify him from speaking on key issues and praised Grassley’s “strong record” on the Judiciary Committee, noting his role as a “working family farmer” who “works” to bring Iowa’s “common sense” to national policies. END OF SUMMARY.
