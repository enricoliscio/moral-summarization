SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school", in a video that surfaced Tuesday. Braley apologized, saying he has "tremendous respect" for Iowa farmers and appreciates their importance to the state. He proclaimed his support for farmers, saying he's "grateful" to have their support. Braley was speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, highlighting the contrast between his background and Grassley's. He emphasized that if elected, he would bring his experience and voice to the Senate Judiciary Committee, whereas Grassley, a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school", would likely become chairman. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, touting Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his ability to bring "common sense" to policy issues. END OF SUMMARY.
