SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school", in a video that surfaced online. Braley apologized, saying he has "tremendous respect" for Iowa farmers and appreciates their importance to the state. He proclaimed his support for them, stating he's "grateful" to have the backing of hundreds of farmers across Iowa. Braley's remarks were meant to highlight the contrast between his own background and Grassley's, implying that Grassley's lack of legal expertise would make him unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, touting the senator's "strong record" on the committee and his ability to bring "common sense" to various policy issues. The controversy has sparked a heated debate in Iowa's Senate campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
