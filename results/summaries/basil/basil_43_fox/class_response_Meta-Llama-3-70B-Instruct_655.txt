SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" in a video that surfaced Tuesday. Braley apologized for his remarks, saying he "respects" Grassley and appreciates Iowa's farmers. However, his initial comments were an attempt to highlight the importance of having a lawyer's perspective on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he hopes to serve on if elected. Braley implied that Grassley's lack of legal experience would make him unfit to lead the committee. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, his own experience as a trial lawyer would disqualify him from speaking on issues like agriculture and healthcare. The spokesperson touted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his unique perspective as a working family farmer. Braley's remarks have sparked controversy, with critics accusing him of elitism and disrespect towards Iowa's agricultural community.

END OF SUMMARY.
