Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Bruce Braley, a Democratic congressman from Iowa, who made some remarks mocking Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator. The video shows Braley saying Grassley is a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during a campaign event. Braley later apologized, saying he respects Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The article also mentions Grassley's spokesperson responding, pointing out that Braley's logic would mean he's not qualified to speak on certain issues and highlighting Grassley's experience and background as a farmer.

Now, for the first part, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

- "Fire" as in "under fire" implies criticism or blame.
- "Mocking" is a negative action, showing disrespect.
- "Respects" shows positive regard.
- "Support" indicates backing or approval.
- "Grateful" is a positive emotion.
- "Fighting" in the context of advocacy.
- "Eligible" relates to capability or worthiness.
- "Strong" as in a positive attribute.
- "Common sense" implies practical and sound judgment.
- "Works" in the sense of effectiveness or benefit.

Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me check again. The article also mentions "background," "experience," "voice," "public way," "stark contrast," "support," "apologized," "tremendous respect," "appreciate," "grateful," "eligible," "strong record," "common sense," "works for all of America." Hmm, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral frame. I think I have the main ones.

For the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping the morally framed words. I'll start by stating that Braley is facing criticism for mocking Grassley, then mention his apology and support for farmers. I'll include the context of the video being from a conservative PAC, his campaign for Senate, and his comments about the Judiciary Committee. Then, I'll note Grassley's spokesperson's response about Braley's eligibility and Grassley's background and experience. I need to keep it under 200 words and include the morally framed words.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first introduce the issue, then Braley's response, the context of the fundraiser, his comments, the spokesperson's rebuttal, and conclude with the implications.

Let me draft it:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video emerged where he mocked Sen. Chuck Grassley, calling him a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley apologized, stating he "respects" Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video, released by a conservative PAC, shows Braley discussing his campaign for Senate and the possibility of Grassley leading the Judiciary Committee. Braley emphasized his background in law, contrasting it with Grassley's lack of legal experience. Grassley's spokesperson countered, questioning Braley's eligibility to discuss certain policies and highlighting Grassley's "strong record" and "common sense" as a farmer. The exchange underscores the political stakes and the importance of agricultural and legal expertise in the race.

I think that captures the main points and includes the morally framed words like "criticism," "mocking," "respects," "supports," "apologized," "eligible," "strong," and "common sense." It's concise and under 200 words.
