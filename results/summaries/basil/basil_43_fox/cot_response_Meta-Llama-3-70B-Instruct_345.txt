SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley apologized, saying he has "tremendous respect" for Iowa farmers and appreciates their importance to the state. He claimed he would "literally" fight for tort reform on the Senate Judiciary Committee, implying Grassley's lack of legal experience makes him unfit for the role. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, his own experience as a trial lawyer would disqualify him from speaking on policy issues like agriculture. The spokesperson touted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his ability to bring "common sense" to various policy areas. Braley's remarks have sparked controversy in the midst of his Senate campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
