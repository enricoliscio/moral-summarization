SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." The video was taken at a fundraiser in Texas, where Braley was speaking to a group of lawyers. Braley apologized for the remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, a spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he as a trial lawyer wouldn't be eligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or healthcare. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's strong record on the judiciary committee and his experience as a working family farmer. The controversy comes as Braley campaigns for Senate in Iowa, a state known for its agriculture industry.
