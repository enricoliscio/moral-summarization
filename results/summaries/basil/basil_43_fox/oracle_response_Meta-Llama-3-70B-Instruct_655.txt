SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley apologized, saying he "respects" Grassley and appreciates the importance of Iowa's farmers, whom he is "grateful" to have the support of. The video, posted by America Rising, shows Braley speaking to lawyers at a Texas fundraiser, where he touted his own experience and background as a trial lawyer, implying that Grassley's lack of legal expertise makes him unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he too would be ineligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture and healthcare. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his "work" on various policy areas, bringing "Iowa common sense" to the Senate. Braley's apology and attempt to "help" his campaign by touting his own experience have been met with criticism.

END OF SUMMARY.
