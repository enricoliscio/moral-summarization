Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the article is about Iowa Democratic Representative Bruce Braley facing criticism after a video where he mocks Senator Chuck Grassley. The video was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising. Braley was speaking at a fundraiser in Texas, addressing lawyers. He made a comment about Grassley being a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." 

Braley apologized, saying he respects Grassley and supports Iowa farmers. He also mentioned wanting to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee if elected, contrasting his background with Grassley's. 

Grassley's spokesperson responded, pointing out that Braley, as a trial lawyer, shouldn't speak on certain issues if his logic holds. They also highlighted Grassley's experience and his role as a working farmer in the Senate.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Braley's remarks, the context of the campaign, his apology, the contrast he made, Grassley's response, and the spokesperson's counterpoints. Also, note the PAC's role in releasing the video.

Let me structure it: Start with Braley's remarks and the context, then his apology, the contrast in Judiciary Committee roles, Grassley's spokesperson's response, and the PAC's involvement. Keep it concise, ensuring all main elements are covered without getting too detailed.
