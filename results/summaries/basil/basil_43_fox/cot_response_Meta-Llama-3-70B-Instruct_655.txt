SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" in a video surfaced Tuesday. Braley apologized, saying he has "tremendous respect" for Iowa farmers and appreciates their importance to the state. He proclaimed his support for Iowa's farmers, saying he's "grateful" to have their support. Braley was speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, highlighting the contrast between his background and Grassley's, implying that Grassley's lack of law experience makes him unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, touting Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his "common sense" approach to policy issues. The spokesperson also noted that Grassley is one of only two working family farmers in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
