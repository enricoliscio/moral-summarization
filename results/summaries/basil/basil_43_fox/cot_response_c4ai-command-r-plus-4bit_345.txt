SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under *fire* after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a “farmer from Iowa who never went to law school”. Braley *apologised* for his remarks, saying he “*respects*” Grassley and is *grateful* to Iowa’s farmers for their support. In the video, Braley suggests that if he wins the Senate race, he would bring his experience as a lawyer to the Senate Judiciary Committee, whereas Grassley, a farmer, would not have the same legal expertise. A spokesperson for Grassley *fired back*, pointing out that Braley's logic would disqualify him from speaking on various policy issues and *touted* Grassley’s “*strong* record” on the judiciary committee and his work on agriculture, energy, and health care policy. Braley's comments sparked criticism as Iowa is known for its agriculture industry, and Grassley is one of the few working family farmers in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
