SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley made the comment at a fundraiser in Texas, where he was speaking to a group of lawyers. He was highlighting the difference between his own background as a trial lawyer and Grassley's lack of legal experience. Braley apologized for the remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, a spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he would not be eligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or healthcare. The spokesperson also touted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his experience as a working family farmer.
