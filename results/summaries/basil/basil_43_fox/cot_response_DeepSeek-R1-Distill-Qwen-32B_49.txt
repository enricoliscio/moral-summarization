Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. They also want me to identify the morally framed words and then create a summary preserving those frames. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

First, the article is about Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley facing criticism after a video where he mocks Sen. Chuck Grassley. Braley called Grassley a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during his Senate campaign. The article mentions that Iowa is known for agriculture, so that context is important.

Braley apologized, saying he respects Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising, showing Braley speaking to lawyers in Texas. Braley wanted to serve on the Judiciary Committee if elected, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying Grassley isn't qualified because he's a farmer without a law background.

Grassley's spokesperson responded, questioning Braley's eligibility to speak on certain policies since he's a trial lawyer. They highlighted Grassley's strong record and his background as a farmer, bringing common sense to various policies.

Now, for the morally framed words. I need to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "mocking," "apologized," "respects," "support," "grateful," "strong record," "common sense," "qualifications," "fairness," and "opportunity." These words carry judgments about actions, values, or qualities.

Next, the summary needs to include these words while being concise. I should mention Braley's remarks, the criticism, his apology, Grassley's response, and the underlying issues of qualifications and fairness. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but include all key points.

Putting it all together, I'll start by stating the main event, then the criticism, Braley's response, Grassley's counter, and the implications. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing.

Let me draft that. Make sure each sentence is clear and includes the necessary terms. Also, check the word count to stay within the limit. I think that's a solid approach.
