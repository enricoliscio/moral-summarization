SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school", in a video that surfaced Tuesday. Braley, who is running for Senate, apologized for his remarks, saying he "respects" Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, his initial comments were meant to contrast his own experience as a trial lawyer with Grassley's lack of legal background, implying that Grassley would not be equipped to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley touted his own "fighting tort reform for thirty years" as a reason to support him. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he himself would not be eligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or health care. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his unique perspective as a working family farmer.
