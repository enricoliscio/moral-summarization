Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. The key here is to identify the morally charged words and make sure they're included in the summary. The article is about Bruce Braley mocking Chuck Grassley, and the author used words like "respect," "appreciate," "support," etc. I need to ensure these words are in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Braley made a comment about Grassley not going to law school, which he later apologized for. He tried to frame it as a contrast between his legal background and Grassley's farming background. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, questioning Braley's eligibility to speak on certain issues because he's a lawyer. 

I need to capture the respect and support aspects. Braley says he respects farmers and supports them, so I'll include that. Also, the spokesperson highlighted Grassley's work and support for agriculture. 

I should structure the summary to include the key events: the video, Braley's apology, the contrast he made, and Grassley's response. Make sure to use the moral words where appropriate. Keep it concise, under 200 words. 

Let me start drafting: mention the video, the mocking comment, the apology, the support for farmers, the contrast in Senate roles, Grassley's spokesperson response, and the emphasis on Grassley's background. 

I need to check word count and ensure all moral terms are included without making it too lengthy. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the moral framing used by the author.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video emerged of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during his Senate campaign. Braley apologized, stating he "respects" Grassley and "appreciates" the importance of Iowa's farmers, expressing gratitude for their "support." The video, released by the conservative PAC America Rising, showed Braley speaking at a fundraiser in Texas. He contrasted his background as a trial lawyer with Grassley's lack of legal experience, suggesting Grassley might become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee if Republicans win the Senate. Grassley's spokesperson countered, questioning Braley's eligibility to speak on policy issues like agriculture, energy, and health care, given his legal background. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the Judiciary Committee and his role as a "working family farmer" bringing "Iowa common sense" to policy decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
