SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced of him making comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, at a fundraiser. In the video, Braley appears to be speaking to a group of lawyers and says that if he wins the Senate race, he would be a voice for them on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He contrasts this with the alternative, which would be having "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" as the committee chair, referring to Grassley. Braley has since apologized for his remarks, stating that he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. A spokesperson for Grassley responded by pointing out that being a trial lawyer does not disqualify one from speaking on various policy issues and highlighted Grassley's own experience as a working family farmer and his strong record on the judiciary committee. The incident has sparked a debate about the role of agriculture and legal expertise in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
