Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley who is facing criticism after a video where he mocked Sen. Chuck Grassley. The video was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising. Braley was speaking at a fundraiser in Texas and made comments about Grassley not having a law background. 

Braley apologized, saying he respects Grassley and supports Iowa farmers. He also mentioned wanting to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee if elected. Grassley's spokesperson responded, pointing out that Braley, as a trial lawyer, shouldn't speak on certain issues and highlighted Grassley's experience and background as a farmer in the Senate.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: who Braley is, the video incident, his apology, the context of the fundraiser, his comments about Grassley, the response from Grassley's side, and the key points made by both sides. I should make sure it's clear and concise, sticking to the facts without getting too detailed.
