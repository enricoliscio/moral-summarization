SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley apologized, saying he "respects" Grassley and appreciates the importance of Iowa's farmers, whom he is "grateful" to have supporting him. The video, posted by America Rising, shows Braley speaking to lawyers at a Texas fundraiser, where he emphasized the need for someone with a legal background on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He implied that Grassley, without a law degree, would not be suitable for the role. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, his own experience as a trial lawyer would disqualify him from speaking on policy issues like agriculture. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his ability to bring "Iowa common sense" to various policy areas, including agriculture, energy, and healthcare, where he "works" for the benefit of all Americans.
