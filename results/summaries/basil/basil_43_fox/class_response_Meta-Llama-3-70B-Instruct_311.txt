SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" in a video that surfaced Tuesday. Braley was speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, where he was campaigning for Senate. He apologized for his remarks, saying he "respects" Grassley and appreciates Iowa's farmers. However, Braley's comments were seen as an attempt to belittle Grassley's qualifications, implying that a lawyer like himself would be more suitable to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he as a trial lawyer would not be eligible to speak out on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or health care. The spokesperson touted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee, highlighting his work on issues like agriculture, anti-trust, and environmental policy. Braley's remarks have sparked controversy, with some seeing them as an attempt to undermine Grassley's credibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
