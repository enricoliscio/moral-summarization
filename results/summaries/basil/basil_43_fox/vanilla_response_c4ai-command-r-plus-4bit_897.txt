SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced of him making remarks about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, at a fundraiser. In the video, Braley appears to dismiss Grassley as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" and contrasts his own background as a lawyer with Grassley's lack of legal education. Braley is running for Senate in a state known for its agriculture industry and has since apologized for his remarks, expressing his respect for Iowa farmers and Grassley. A spokesperson for Grassley pushed back against Braley's comments, highlighting the senator's experience as a farmer and his work on various policy issues. The video was released by a conservative super PAC and has sparked discussions about Braley's suitability to represent Iowa in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
