SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced of him making comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, at a fundraiser. In the video, Braley suggests that having a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee would be less desirable than having someone with a legal background. Braley apologized for his remarks, stating that he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. A spokesperson for Grassley countered Braley's comments, highlighting the senator's diverse policy experience and his background as a working family farmer. The incident has sparked debate, with some arguing that Braley's comments display a disconnect with Iowa's agricultural community and others questioning whether a lawyer is necessary to chair the committee. The video was released by a conservative super PAC as Braley campaigns for a Senate seat in Iowa, a state known for its agriculture industry.
END OF SUMMARY.
