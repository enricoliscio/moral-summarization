Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions to keep as many of the morally charged words as possible, like "mocking," "help," "fighting," "tort," and "reform." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Bruce Braley mocking Chuck Grassley, his apology, the context of the campaign, and the reactions. 

I should make sure to include "mocking" when describing Braley's action. Also, when Braley talks about fighting tort reform, that's a key point to include. The word "help" comes up when he's talking about supporters helping him win the race. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the main events: Braley mocked Grassley, apologized, the context of the fundraiser, his campaign goals, and the response from Grassley's team. 

I should structure it to first mention the mocking, then his apology, the fundraiser details, his Senate ambitions, the contrast he made, the spokesperson's counter, and Grassley's credentials. 

I'll make sure to use the words "mocking," "help," "fighting," "tort," and "reform" where appropriate. Also, I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all necessary points without being too lengthy. 

Let me draft it out, checking word count and ensuring all moral framing words are included. I'll start with the main event, then the apology, the fundraiser context, his statements about the Judiciary Committee, the spokesperson's response, and conclude with Grassley's background. 

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's concise and includes all the required elements.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during his Senate campaign. Braley apologized, stating he "respects" Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video, released by a conservative PAC, showed Braley speaking at a Texas fundraiser, where he contrasted his background as a trial lawyer with Grassley's lack of legal experience. Braley emphasized his commitment to "fighting tort reform" and his desire to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley's spokesperson countered, arguing that Braley's logic would disqualify him from speaking on key issues and highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the committee, as well as his status as a working family farmer. Braley's remarks sparked debate over qualifications and the role of farmers in shaping policy. END OF SUMMARY.
