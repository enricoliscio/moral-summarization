Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Bruce Braley and Chuck Grassley. Let me read through the article first to understand what's happening. 

So, Bruce Braley is a Democratic Representative from Iowa who's running for the Senate. A video came out where he mocked Chuck Grassley, a Republican Senator from Iowa, calling him a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." That's during Braley's campaign in a state known for agriculture, which might be a sensitive topic. 

Braley apologized, saying he respects Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising, and it shows Braley speaking at a fundraiser in Texas to lawyers. Braley mentioned that if he wins, he'd want to be on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but if Republicans take the Senate, Grassley might become chairman. He contrasted his legal experience with Grassley's background, implying Grassley isn't suited for the role.

Grassley's spokesperson responded, pointing out that if Braley's logic holds, Braley, as a trial lawyer, wouldn't be eligible to speak on certain policy issues like agriculture. They also highlighted Grassley's strong record on the Judiciary Committee and his background as a working farmer, contributing to various policies.

So, the key points are: Braley mocked Grassley's background, Braley apologized, the context of the fundraiser and his campaign, Grassley's response, and the broader implications of their qualifications for the Judiciary Committee.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I should start with Braley's remarks, his apology, the context, the contrast he made, and Grassley's response. 

I should also mention the PAC that released the video and the fact that Grassley is one of two working farmers in the Senate, emphasizing his experience. 

I think the summary should flow logically: introduce Braley's comment, his apology, the event where he made the remarks, his campaign goals, the contrast with Grassley, Grassley's response, and the significance of their qualifications.

I need to be concise but cover all main points. Let me structure it step by step to ensure nothing important is missed.
