SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." The comments were made at a fundraiser in Texas, and Braley has since apologized, expressing his respect for Grassley and Iowa's farmers, for whom he is grateful to have support. In the video, Braley asks for help to win the race, highlighting the potential contrast between himself, with a legal background, and Grassley, who never practiced law. Braley suggests that having a lawyer on the Senate Judiciary Committee would be beneficial. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, defending the senator's strong record on the judiciary committee and his valuable contributions to various policy areas as a working family farmer with Iowa common sense. 

END OF SUMMARY.
