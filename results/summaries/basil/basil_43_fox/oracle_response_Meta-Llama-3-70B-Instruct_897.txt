SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley apologized, saying he "respects" Grassley and appreciates the importance of Iowa's farmers, for whom he is "grateful" to have their support. The video, posted by conservative super PAC America Rising, shows Braley speaking to lawyers at a Texas fundraiser, where he emphasized the importance of having a lawyer's perspective on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He implied that Grassley, a farmer, would not be suitable for the role. A spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, his own experience as a trial lawyer would disqualify him from speaking on policy issues like agriculture. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his ability to bring "Iowa common sense" to work on various policy issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
