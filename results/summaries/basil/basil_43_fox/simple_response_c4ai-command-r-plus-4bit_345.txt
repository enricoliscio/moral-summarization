SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash and accusations of elitism after a video surfaced of him making derogatory remarks about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a respected Republican senator from Iowa and a farmer. Braley, a lawyer, was recorded at a fundraiser in Texas mocking Grassley as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school," suggesting that his own legal background makes him more qualified to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. This is despite the fact that Grassley has a strong record on the judiciary committee and brings valuable Iowa common sense to a range of policy areas. Braley's comments are particularly insensitive given Iowa's strong agricultural industry and the important role that farmers play in the state's economy and culture. Braley has since apologized, but his remarks raise questions about his respect for the contributions of farmers and the importance of diverse backgrounds in public service. END OF SUMMARY.
