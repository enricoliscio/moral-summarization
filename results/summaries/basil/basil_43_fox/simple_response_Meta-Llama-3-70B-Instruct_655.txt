SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley made the comment while speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, implying that Grassley's lack of law school education makes him unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley apologized for his remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, a spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he as a trial lawyer would not be eligible to speak out on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or healthcare. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's strong record on the judiciary committee and his experience as a working family farmer. The incident has sparked controversy, with Braley's comments being seen as elitist and dismissive of Grassley's rural background.
