Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article is about Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley making a mocking comment about Sen. Chuck Grassley during his campaign. The video was released by a conservative PAC, and Braley apologized, saying he respects farmers and Grassley. Braley was speaking at a lawyers' fundraiser, comparing himself to Grassley in terms of Senate Judiciary Committee roles. Grassley's spokesperson fired back, questioning Braley's eligibility to speak on certain issues and highlighting Grassley's background as a farmer and his work on the committee.

I need to capture the key points: Braley's comment, the context of the campaign, the response from Grassley's side, and the moral implications of the attack. The author seems to present it as a clash of backgrounds and qualifications, with Braley's remarks possibly undermining Grassley's legitimacy despite his experience.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main elements: who, what, when, where, why, and the moral angle. I'll structure it to show Braley's criticism, the context of the campaign, the response, and the underlying issue of qualifications versus experience.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and sticks to the moral framing without adding my own bias.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican, during his Senate campaign. Braley, speaking at a lawyers' fundraiser, referred to Grassley as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school," highlighting a contrast in their qualifications for the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley later apologized, stating his respect for Iowa farmers and Grassley, while emphasizing his own legal background. Grassley's spokesperson countered, questioning Braley's eligibility to discuss policy issues and highlighting Grassley's "Iowa common sense" and experience as a working farmer and senator. The exchange underscores tensions over qualifications versus practical experience in public service. END OF SUMMARY.
