Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words: mocking, help, fighting, tort, reform. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Rep. Bruce Braley making a mocking remark about Sen. Chuck Grassley during his campaign. The article mentions the video, the apology, and the response from Grassley's spokesperson.

I need to make sure that in the summary, I include the words'mocking', 'help', 'fighting', 'tort', and'reform'. I'll structure the summary to highlight Braley's actions and the subsequent reactions, ensuring these terms are naturally integrated.

I should start by stating that Braley mocked Grassley, using the term'mocking'. Then, mention his campaign and the context of Iowa's agriculture. Include his apology and the support he claims from farmers. Next, describe the fundraiser where he spoke to lawyers, aiming to join the Judiciary Committee. Use 'help' when talking about the impact of voters choosing him. Highlight his 'fighting' against tort reform. 

Then, address Grassley's spokesperson response, pointing out the inconsistency in Braley's argument, using 'help' again if possible. Finally, mention Grassley's background as a farmer and his work in the Senate, tying back to the moral framing.

I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including all the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" during his Senate campaign. Braley apologized, stating he "respects" Grassley and supports Iowa's farmers. The video, released by the conservative super PAC America Rising, showed Braley speaking to lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley emphasized his experience fighting tort reform and suggested that if elected, he could serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He contrasted his background with Grassley's, implying Grassley's lack of legal experience. Grassley's spokesperson countered, arguing that Braley's logic would disqualify him from speaking on key issues like agriculture and health care. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's "strong record" on the Judiciary Committee and his role as a working farmer, bringing "Iowa common sense" to policy matters. Braley's remarks sparked debate over qualifications and representation in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
