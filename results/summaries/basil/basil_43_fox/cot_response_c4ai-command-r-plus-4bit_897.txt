SUMMARY: 
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism and *fire* after a video surfaced of him making remarks that many perceived as disparaging towards Sen. Chuck Grassley, a respected Republican senator from Iowa known for his agricultural background. In the video, Braley appears to be *fighting* for the support of a group of lawyers, stating that a choice must be made between himself, a lawyer with a thirty-year track record, and Grassley, "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley has since apologized, expressing his *respect* for Iowa farmers and his *gratitude* for their *support*. He also acknowledged his appreciation for Grassley's *strong* record on the judiciary committee and his contribution to various policy areas with Iowa *common sense*. Braley's comments have sparked a backlash, with critics arguing that they reflect a lack of appreciation for the agricultural community and the importance of diverse backgrounds in policymaking. The incident raises questions about the role of background and experience in shaping one's perspective and eligibility to speak on certain issues. END OF SUMMARY.
