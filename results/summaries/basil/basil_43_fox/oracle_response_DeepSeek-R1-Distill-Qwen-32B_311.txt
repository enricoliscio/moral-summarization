Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Bruce Braley mocking Chuck Grassley and the subsequent fallout. The author used words like "respects," "respect," "appreciate," "grateful," "support," "help," "fighting," "work," and "works." I should make sure to include these terms where appropriate.

First, I'll outline the main points: Braley made a mocking remark about Grassley during a campaign event, apologized, Grassley's spokesperson criticized him, and highlighted Grassley's background and achievements.

I need to structure the summary to include the key moral words. I'll start by mentioning Braley's remarks, then his apology and expressions of respect and support. Then, I'll note Grassley's spokesperson's counterpoints, emphasizing Grassley's work and experience.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. Let me make sure each sentence includes the moral framing where it fits naturally without forcing it. Also, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faced criticism after a video emerged where he mocked Sen. Chuck Grassley, calling him a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school," during his Senate campaign. Braley apologized, expressing respect for Iowa farmers and his support for their importance to the state. The video, shared by a conservative PAC, showed Braley speaking at a Texas fundraiser, where he contrasted his background with Grassley's, suggesting Grassley, as a farmer without a law degree, might lead the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley's spokesperson countered, questioning Braley's eligibility to speak on certain issues and highlighting Grassley's "strong record" on the Judiciary Committee, as well as his role as a working family farmer bringing "Iowa common sense" to key policy areas. Braley emphasized his commitment to fighting for tort reform and serving on the Judiciary Committee if elected. END OF SUMMARY.
