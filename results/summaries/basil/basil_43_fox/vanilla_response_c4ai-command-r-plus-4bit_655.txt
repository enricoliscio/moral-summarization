SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced of him making remarks about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, at a fundraiser. In the video, Braley appears to be speaking to a group of lawyers and says that if he wins the Senate race, he would be a voice for them on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He contrasts this with Grassley, who he describes as "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley has since apologized for his remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. A spokesperson for Grassley pushed back against Braley's comments, highlighting the senator's experience and work in various policy areas. The video was released by a conservative super PAC and has sparked debate about Braley's suitability to represent Iowa in the Senate, given the state's strong agriculture industry.
END OF SUMMARY.
