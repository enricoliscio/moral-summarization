SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley made the comment at a fundraiser in Texas, where he was speaking to a group of lawyers about his campaign for Senate. He apologized for the remarks, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, a spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, he as a trial lawyer would not be eligible to speak out on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or health care. The spokesperson highlighted Grassley's strong record on the judiciary committee and his experience as a working family farmer. The controversy comes as Braley campaigns to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
