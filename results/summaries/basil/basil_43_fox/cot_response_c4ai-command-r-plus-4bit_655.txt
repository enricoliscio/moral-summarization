SUMMARY:
Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is **under fire** after a video surfaced of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a “farmer from Iowa who never went to law school.” In the video, which was released during Braley’s campaign for Senate in the agriculture-heavy state, Braley suggests that his own background as a lawyer would be more suitable for the Senate Judiciary Committee than Grassley's. Braley has since **apologized** for his remarks, expressing his **respect** for Grassley and Iowa’s farmers, and his **gratitude** for the support he has received from them. A spokesperson for Grassley pushed back, highlighting the senator’s “**strong** record” on the judiciary committee and his valuable contributions to policy areas such as agriculture, energy, and healthcare, thanks to his “common sense” approach.
END OF SUMMARY.
