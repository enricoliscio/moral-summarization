SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced of him making remarks that many interpreted as disparaging towards farmers. In the video, Braley appears to be speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser, saying that if he wins the Senate race, he would be a voice for lawyers on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He contrasts this with the current chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, whom he describes as "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Braley's comments were seen as offensive to the agriculture industry, which is a significant sector in Iowa. Braley apologized for his remarks, stating that he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. A spokesperson for Grassley countered Braley's logic, highlighting the senator's diverse policy expertise and strong record on the judiciary committee. The incident has sparked a debate about the role of farmers and lawyers in politics, with some arguing that Braley's comments reflect a disconnect between urban and rural America. END OF SUMMARY.
