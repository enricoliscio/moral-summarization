SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing criticism after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley apologized, saying he "respects" Grassley and appreciates the importance of Iowa's farmers. He expressed gratitude for the support of hundreds of farmers across Iowa. The video, posted by America Rising, shows Braley speaking to lawyers at a Texas fundraiser, where he emphasized the importance of having a voice with legal experience on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley's spokesperson argued that by his own logic, he, as a trial lawyer, wouldn't be eligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture. Grassley's aide touted the senator's "strong record" on the judiciary committee and his ability to bring "Iowa common sense" to work on various policy areas, including agriculture, energy, and healthcare. Braley's apology emphasized his support for Iowa's farmers and his commitment to fighting for their interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
