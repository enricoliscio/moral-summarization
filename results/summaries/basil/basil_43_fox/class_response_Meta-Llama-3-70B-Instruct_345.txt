SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire for mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school", in a video that surfaced Tuesday. Braley apologized for his remarks, saying he "respects" Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, the video shows Braley trying to appeal to lawyers at a Texas fundraiser, saying that if elected, he would fight for tort reform on the Senate Judiciary Committee, implying that Grassley's lack of law school education makes him unfit for the role. Braley's spokesperson argued that by his own logic, as a trial lawyer, he wouldn't be eligible to speak on policy issues like agriculture, energy, or healthcare. Grassley's office fired back, highlighting his strong record on the judiciary committee and his unique perspective as a working family farmer. The controversy has sparked a heated debate about qualifications and experience in politics.
