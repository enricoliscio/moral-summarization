SUMMARY:

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash after a video surfaced showing him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, as a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley made the comment while speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas, suggesting that if he's elected to the Senate, he would be a better fit for the Senate Judiciary Committee than Grassley, who he implied lacks legal expertise. Braley has since apologized, saying he respects Grassley and Iowa's farmers. However, a spokesperson for Grassley fired back, arguing that by Braley's logic, his own background as a trial lawyer would disqualify him from speaking on certain policy issues. The spokesperson also highlighted Grassley's strong record on the judiciary committee and his experience as a working family farmer.

END OF SUMMARY.
