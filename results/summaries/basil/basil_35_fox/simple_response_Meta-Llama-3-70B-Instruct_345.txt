SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has sparked controversy, with concerns over the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, highlighting the severe and growing Islamist threat. A significant August 2012 cable warned of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia's presence in Benghazi, and foreshadowed the attack. Despite this, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the warning, which former diplomatic security agents deem a "cry for help." The State Department's internal review found senior officials demonstrated a "lack of proactive leadership and management ability" in response to security concerns, but no misconduct. The administration's failure to prioritize security and protect American lives is a grave moral failure, underscoring a lack of accountability and responsibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
