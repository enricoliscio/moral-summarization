SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial storyline on the Benghazi attack has been called into question, with evidence suggesting that the State Department failed to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, highlighting the severe and growing Islamist threat. Despite these warnings, the administration downplayed the threat, with Secretary of State Clinton claiming she had no knowledge of the warnings. The failure to respond to these warnings has been deemed negligent by a former diplomatic security agent. The moral failure of the State Department's leadership is clear, with a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in response to security concerns. The administration's attempts to strip out references to prior attacks and downplay the severity of the threat are a clear breach of trust and responsibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
