SUMMARY: Recently surfaced documents and testimony reveal that the State Department received warnings of security threats in Benghazi prior to the attack on the US consulate in September 2012. A classified State Department cable from August 2012, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature, warned of the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi and the lack of adequate security measures to protect US personnel. During congressional hearings, Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of this cable. The cable also noted that the group charged with protecting the consulate appeared to be compromised and that there had been a spike in violence against foreigners in the region. These revelations, along with ongoing controversy over the Obama administration's initial response to the attack, raise questions about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. The State Department has acknowledged that certain senior officials demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership but stopped short of finding misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
