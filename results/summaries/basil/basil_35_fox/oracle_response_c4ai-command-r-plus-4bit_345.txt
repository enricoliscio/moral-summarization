SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has brought to light concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Emails revealed that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland tried to strip references to prior attacks in Benghazi, not wanting to give Congress ammunition to "beat up" on her department. A classified State Department cable from August 2012, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature, warned of the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi and the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, tasked with protecting the consulate. The cable also foreshadowed the attack, expressing concerns about the ability to defend the compound in Benghazi due to limited resources and host nation support. Despite this, Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of the cable during congressional hearings, with a former diplomatic security agent calling it a "cry for help." The State Department's failure to respond to security requests and repeated warnings of the growing threat and increasing violence in Libya, including attacks on other foreign entities, highlights negligence and a lack of proactive leadership and management within the department.
END OF SUMMARY.
