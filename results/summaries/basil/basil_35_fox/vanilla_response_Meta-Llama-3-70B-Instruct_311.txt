SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial storyline on the Benghazi attack has been called into question, with concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi, and President Obama acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. A review of State Department records and a classified cable revealed a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya about the Islamist threat. The cable, sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia's presence in Benghazi and expressed concerns about the ability to defend the post in the event of a coordinated attack. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the warning, and a former diplomatic security agent argued that the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.
