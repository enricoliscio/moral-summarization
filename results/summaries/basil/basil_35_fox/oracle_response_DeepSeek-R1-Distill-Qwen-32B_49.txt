Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of the situation. It mentions that the State Department had prior warnings but didn't act on them. Victoria Nuland tried to strip references to previous attacks to avoid Congress's criticism. President Obama admitted that the staff wasn't adequately protected. There were classified cables showing severe threats and compromised security. Secretary Clinton claimed she wasn't informed, and there's a question about negligence in leadership.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. The list includes words like attack, failure, strip, etc. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long.

I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's failure, the stripping of information, the growing threat, and the negligence in leadership. I'll make sure to include key points like the classified cables, Clinton's lack of knowledge, and the overall negligence.

I'll start by mentioning the controversy, then the initial storyline and Nuland's actions. Then, the documented warnings and the administration's acknowledgment of inadequate protection. I'll note the classified cables and the lack of response, leading to the attack. Include Clinton's testimony and the subsequent questions about her knowledge. Conclude with the internal review pointing to negligence and lack of leadership.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key moral points are included. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary.

SUMMARY: The controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack highlights concerns about leadership failure and negligence. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland sought to strip references to prior attacks to avoid giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the department. President Obama acknowledged that staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified cables and public records reveal documented warnings about the growing Islamist threat, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi. Despite these warnings, the administration failed to provide adequate security, with requests for assistance going unanswered. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of a critical classified cable, sparking questions about her leadership. A former diplomatic security agent argued that the multiple warnings present a compelling case of negligence. An internal review found senior officials lacked proactive leadership but did not find misconduct. The attack on the consulate, ultimately blamed on Ansar al-Sharia, underscored the administration's failure to act on documented threats. END OF SUMMARY.
