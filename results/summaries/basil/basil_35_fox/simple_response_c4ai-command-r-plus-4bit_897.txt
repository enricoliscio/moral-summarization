SUMMARY: The Benghazi scandal resurfaces with new evidence revealing the State Department's negligence in addressing security concerns. Documents obtained by media outlets show Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, attempting to conceal prior attacks in Benghazi to avoid criticism from Congress. A classified State Department cable from August 2012, signed by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi and the compromised security of the consulate. This cable did not reach Secretary Clinton or above the assistant secretary level. Testimonies from General Martin Dempsey and diplomatic security agents further highlight the negligence of State Department leadership. The multiple warnings and documented attacks on foreign entities in Benghazi underscore the failure of the State Department to act on these threats, endangering the lives of their personnel and exposing their incompetence in ensuring the safety of their diplomats.

END OF SUMMARY.
