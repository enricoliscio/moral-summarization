SUMMARY: The Benghazi scandal resurfaces, casting doubt on the Obama administration's handling of the attack. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, attempted to downplay the issue by removing references to previous attacks, but evidence shows a pattern of negligence. A classified cable from Ambassador Chris Stevens warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi, along with a compromised security group. This cable, which seemed to foreshadow the attack, did not reach the attention of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, despite being marked as SECRET. The cable also revealed a lack of adequate defense capabilities and host nation support. The State Department's internal review acknowledged leadership failures but stopped short of assigning specific misconduct. This controversy highlights a concerning lack of accountability and action from the State Department leadership, endangering the lives of diplomatic staff in dangerous regions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
