SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi. A classified State Department cable, marked SECRET, warned of a severe and growing Islamist threat in Libya, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia. The cable, sent in August 2012, also expressed concerns about the ability to defend the consulate in the event of a coordinated attack. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the cable. Records show a steady stream of documented warnings and over 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack. A former diplomatic security agent argues that the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.
