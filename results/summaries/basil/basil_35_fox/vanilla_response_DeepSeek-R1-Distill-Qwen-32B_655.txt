Okay, I need to summarize this article about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of it. The article talks about how the State Department tried to downplay prior attacks, with Victoria Nuland removing references. They also mention a classified cable warning about the threat, which Secretary Clinton didn't see. There were multiple warnings and security issues, and some officials think the leadership was negligent. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points like the controversy, the talking points, the cable, Clinton's lack of knowledge, and the negligence claims. I should structure it clearly, starting with the controversy, then the details of the warnings, and end with the negligence and State Department's response.

SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, with concerns over documented warnings and security lapses. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to remove references to prior attacks in official talking points to avoid criticism. President Obama acknowledged inadequate protection for staff in Benghazi. A classified August 2012 cable, signed by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of a severe Islamist threat, including the presence of Al Qaeda and compromised security forces. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she was unaware of the cable, despite it being reviewed by military officials. The cable highlighted security shortcomings, such as limited manpower and host nation support. Over 200 security incidents in Libya were documented before the attack, with warnings of increasing violence against foreigners. A former diplomatic security agent argued that State Department leadership was negligent, though an internal review found no misconduct but criticized leadership for lacking proactive management. END OF SUMMARY.
