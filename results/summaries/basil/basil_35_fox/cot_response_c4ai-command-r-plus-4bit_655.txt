SUMMARY: A controversy has resurfaced regarding the Obama administration's initial narrative on the Benghazi attack, highlighting concerns about the State Department leadership's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland is accused of attempting to remove references to prior attacks in Benghazi from "talking points," arguing that Congress should not have ammunition to "beat up" on her department. The controversy is underscored by a classified State Department cable, sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warning of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi and the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, tasked with protecting the consulate. Despite this, Secretary of State Clinton denied knowledge of the warning during congressional hearings. The State Department's internal review found a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in response to security concerns but stopped short of finding misconduct. The article suggests that the State Department leadership was negligent in ignoring multiple warnings and failing to provide adequate protection to its staff in Benghazi. END OF SUMMARY.
