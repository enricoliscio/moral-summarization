SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has brought to light State Department concerns about leadership's failure to act on warnings and security incidents. Documents obtained by media outlets reveal efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland to strip references to prior attacks in Benghazi, citing concerns about giving Congress ammunition. A classified State Department cable from August 2012 warned of a significant threat of terrorist activity, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi. It also highlighted concerns about the ability to defend against a coordinated attack due to limited resources and host nation support. Despite these warnings, Secretary Clinton testified that she had no knowledge of the cable, which diplomatic security agents described as a cry for help. The multiple warnings and documented attacks underscore a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent in their failure to protect their staff in Benghazi. While an internal review found a lack of proactive leadership, no specific finding of misconduct was made.
END OF SUMMARY.
