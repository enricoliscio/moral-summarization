SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has come under scrutiny, with concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" revealed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks, with the goal of avoiding giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the department. Despite this, President Obama acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. A review of State Department records and a classified cable revealed a steady stream of warnings about the growing Islamist threat in Libya, including a significant threat of terrorist activity. The cable warned of compromised security and a lack of host nation support, foreshadowing the attack. Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the warning, which former diplomatic security agents described as a "cry for help." The controversy raises questions about the State Department's leadership and management, with allegations of negligence and misconduct. END OF SUMMARY.
