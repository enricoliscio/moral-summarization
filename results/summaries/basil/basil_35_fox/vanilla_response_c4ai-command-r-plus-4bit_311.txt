SUMMARY: Recently released documents and testimony have brought renewed attention to the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack and the State Department's failure to act on security warnings. Emails and drafts obtained by media outlets show that State Department officials attempted to downplay prior security incidents and warnings in Benghazi, with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland expressing concern about giving Congress ammunition to "beat up" on the department. A classified State Department cable from August 2012, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature, warned of the presence of Islamist militias and Al Qaeda training camps in Benghazi and highlighted concerns about the ability to defend the consulate in the event of an attack. Despite these warnings, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified that she had no knowledge of the cable, claiming it did not reach her level of leadership. The State Department has acknowledged leadership failures in response to security concerns but stopped short of finding specific misconduct. The controversy underscores the ongoing scrutiny of the Obama administration's response to the Benghazi attack and the State Department's handling of security threats.
