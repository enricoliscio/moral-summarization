Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The user mentioned that I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications here.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Benghazi attack and the controversy over the Obama administration's handling of it. The key issues seem to be warnings that were ignored, the State Department's response, and the negligence in protecting the consulate.

I notice that the article talks about classified cables showing warnings about the threat in Benghazi, but these weren't acted upon. The State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, tried to downplay prior attacks to avoid scrutiny. President Obama admitted that the staff wasn't adequately protected. Secretary Clinton claimed she wasn't aware of the warnings, which some found surprising.

The moral framing here is about negligence and failure to act despite clear warnings. The State Department's leadership is criticized for not taking the threats seriously, leading to the attack. There's also the issue of accountability, with Clinton's lack of knowledge being a point of contention.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the ethical failures. I should mention the warnings, the attempts to downplay the situation, the admission of inadequate protection, and the criticism of leadership. Also, include the internal review that found a lack of proactive leadership.

I'll structure it to start with the controversy, then the warnings, the attempts to downplay, the admission, Clinton's testimony, the internal review, and the overall negligence. Make sure it's concise and captures the moral aspects without getting bogged down in too much detail.

SUMMARY: The controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack highlights concerns about negligence and failure to act on documented warnings. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland sought to downplay prior attacks to avoid congressional scrutiny, while President Obama later acknowledged inadequate protection for staff. Classified cables revealed warnings from intelligence and security officials about the growing Islamist threat, including the presence of Al Qaeda-linked groups and compromised local security forces. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she was unaware of the critical cable, sparking criticism of leadership negligence. An internal review found senior officials lacked proactive management in addressing security concerns, though no misconduct was explicitly identified. The failure to act on repeated warnings underscores ethical failures in prioritizing security and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
