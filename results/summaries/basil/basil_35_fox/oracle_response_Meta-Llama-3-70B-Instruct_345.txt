SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has come under scrutiny, with concerns over the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, highlighting the growing Islamist threat. A significant warning came in an August 2012 classified cable, which warned of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia's presence in Benghazi and expressed concerns about the ability to defend the consulate in the event of a coordinated attack. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to provide adequate protection, leading to the assault that killed four Americans. The administration's initial storyline has been disputed, with allegations that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland stripped out references to prior attacks in Benghazi to avoid giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the department. The controversy raises questions about the leadership's failure to act and the lack of proactive leadership and management ability in response to security concerns.
