Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the controversy around the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack. It mentions that State Department records show warnings about the threat, but these weren't properly addressed. Victoria Nuland tried to strip references to prior attacks to avoid criticism. President Obama acknowledged that the staff wasn't adequately protected. A classified cable highlighted the severe threat but wasn't brought to Secretary Clinton's attention. The State Department's internal review found a lack of proactive leadership but no misconduct.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article: attack, failure, strip, attacks, argued, protected, threat, growing, activity, protecting, compromised, provide, unanswered, assault, conference, violence, spike, targeted, help, demonstrated, leadership, management, misconduct.

I should ensure these words are included in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to highlight the key points: documented warnings, stripping references, lack of protection, negligence, and the internal review's findings.

I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the criticism towards the administration's handling of security. I'll also keep the summary clear and to the point, ensuring all critical elements are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack highlights concerns about leadership failure to act on documented warnings. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to strip references to prior attacks to avoid giving Congress ammunition to criticize her department. President Obama acknowledged that staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified State Department records revealed repeated warnings about the growing Islamist threat, including a cable detailing the presence of Al Qaeda and compromised security support. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the critical cable, which former security agents described as a "cry for help." A State Department internal review found senior officials lacked proactive leadership and management but did not find misconduct. The failure to address security concerns has been criticized as negligent, with multiple warnings indicating inadequate protection and support for the consulate. END OF SUMMARY.
