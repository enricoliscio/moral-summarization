SUMMARY: Controversy has resurfaced regarding the Obama administration's initial narrative on the Benghazi attack, highlighting concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. According to drafts of talking points, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to remove references to prior attacks in Benghazi to avoid criticism from Congress. A classified State Department cable from August 2012 revealed warnings about the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi, as well as concerns about the ability to defend the consulate. Despite the warnings, the State Department leadership failed to take adequate security measures. During congressional hearings, Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of the cable, while Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed surprise that she was unaware of it. The group Ansar al-Sharia was also well-established in Benghazi, and multiple attacks on foreign targets had occurred in the year leading up to the assault. A former diplomatic security agent characterized the cable as a "cry for help," suggesting negligence on the part of State Department leadership. The State Department has acknowledged leadership failures but has not found specific misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
