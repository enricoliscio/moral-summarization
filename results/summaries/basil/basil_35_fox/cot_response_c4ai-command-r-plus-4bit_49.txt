SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing renewed controversy over its handling of the Benghazi attack, with new evidence suggesting that the State Department leadership failed to act on warnings and security incidents. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, attempted to downplay the prior attacks in Benghazi to avoid criticism from Congress. Even President Obama admitted that the staff in Benghazi lacked adequate protection.

A classified State Department cable from August 2012 warned of a significant Islamist threat, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, and foreshadowed the attack on the consulate. Despite this, Secretary of State Clinton denied knowledge of the warning during congressional hearings, claiming it did not reach her level of attention. However, other officials, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were aware of the cable, raising questions about Clinton's negligence.

The group Ansar al-Sharia was well-established in Benghazi and had a history of targeting foreigners. State Department records also documented numerous security incidents and warnings in the year leading up to the attack. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to provide adequate security, leading to accusations of leadership misconduct and negligence. While the State Department acknowledged a lack of proactive leadership, it stopped short of admitting misconduct. 

END OF SUMMARY.
