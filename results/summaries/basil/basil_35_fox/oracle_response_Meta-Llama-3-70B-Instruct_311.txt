SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland arguing that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to "beat up" on her department. President Obama acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, detailing the severe and growing Islamist threat. The cables warned of terrorist activity, compromised security, and a lack of host nation support, foreshadowing the attack. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the cables, which former diplomatic security agents called a "cry for help." The controversy raises questions about the State Department's leadership, management, and misconduct in responding to security concerns.
