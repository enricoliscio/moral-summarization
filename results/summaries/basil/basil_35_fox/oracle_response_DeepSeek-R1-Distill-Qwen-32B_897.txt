Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I need to make sure those are included as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of the situation. The key issues are the warnings that were ignored, the State Department's actions, and the accountability of officials like Hillary Clinton.

I need to highlight the moral issues: failure to act on warnings, stripping references, compromised security, negligence, and the lack of leadership. I should use the words like "attack," "failure," "strip," "protected," "threat," "compromised," "unanswered," "assault," "help," "negligence," "leadership," "management," and "misconduct."

I'll start by mentioning the resurgent controversy over the administration's initial storyline. Then, note that the State Department's talking points tried to strip references to prior attacks. Victoria Nuland's argument about not giving Congress ammo is important. President Obama's acknowledgment that staff weren't protected is a key point.

Next, the documented warnings from intelligence officials about the growing threat should be included. The August 2012 classified cable is crucial, detailing the presence of militias and the compromised security. Hillary Clinton's claim of not knowing about the cable and the subsequent questioning by Congress add to the moral framing.

I should mention the negligence and the internal review's findings about leadership failure. Also, the State Department's response that there was no misconduct, but a lack of proactive leadership.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key morally framed words without making it too long. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is concise and the moral elements are clear.

SUMMARY: The Benghazi attack controversy highlights the Obama administration's failure to act on documented warnings. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland stripped references to prior attacks to avoid giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize her department. President Obama acknowledged that staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified cables revealed growing threats from Islamist militias and Al Qaeda-affiliated groups, with warnings of compromised security and unanswered requests for police presence. Despite these warnings, Hillary Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the critical cable, sparking questions about leadership negligence. A State Department review found senior officials lacked proactive management but did not conclude misconduct. The controversy underscores failures in protecting U.S. personnel and addressing security concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
