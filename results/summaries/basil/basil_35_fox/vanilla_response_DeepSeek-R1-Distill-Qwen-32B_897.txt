Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of it. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the controversy over the initial story from the Obama administration regarding the Benghazi attack. There's mention of State Department concerns about leadership failing to act on warnings. They obtained talking points where Victoria Nuland tried to remove references to prior attacks to prevent Congress from criticizing the department. President Obama admitted that the staff wasn't adequately protected.

Then, there's a classified cable from August 2012 that warned about the severe threat from Islamist militias and Al Qaeda in Benghazi. This cable was sent to Secretary Clinton but she claimed she didn't see it. During congressional hearings, she said she wasn't aware of the cable, and the Accountability Review Board placed responsibility at a lower level. However, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs confirmed he knew about it, raising questions about why Clinton wasn't informed.

The article also mentions over 200 security incidents leading up to the attack, with increased targeting of foreigners. A former security agent believes there was negligence in State Department leadership. The State Department's internal review found a lack of proactive leadership but no misconduct.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll focus on the key points: the controversy, the talking points, Nuland's actions, Obama's admission, the classified cable's warnings, Clinton's lack of awareness, the congressional findings, the security incidents, the negligence claim, and the internal review's conclusions.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too detailed. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each paragraph covers a specific aspect without overlapping.

I'll start with the controversy and the talking points, then move to the classified cable and its implications, followed by Clinton's testimony and the internal review. Finally, mention the negligence claim and the internal findings. That should cover all necessary points succinctly.
