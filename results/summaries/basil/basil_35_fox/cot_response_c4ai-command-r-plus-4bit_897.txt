SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has brought to light concerns about the State Department leadership's failure to act on documented warnings of security threats. Emails revealed that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to strip references to prior attacks in Benghazi, arguing that Congress should not be given ammunition to "beat up" on her department. Despite acknowledged shortcomings in protection, the State Department failed to act on warnings from intelligence and security officials, including a classified cable sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warning of the presence of Al Qaeda, Ansar al-Sharia, and other Islamist militias in Benghazi. This cable also foreshadowed the attack, expressing concerns about the ability to defend the consulate due to limited resources and host nation support. Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of this cable during congressional hearings, but her testimony was called into question by Senator Lindsey Graham and General Martin Dempsey. The State Department's failure to respond to security requests and warnings of a growing Islamist threat raises questions of negligence and misconduct.
