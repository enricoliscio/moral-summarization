SUMMARY:
The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" show efforts to strip out references to prior attacks, with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland arguing that the administration should not give Congress "ammunition to beat up" on her department. Classified cables reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya, including a significant warning in August 2012 that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi, where the CIA briefed on the severe and growing Islamist threat. The cable warned of inadequate security measures, limited manpower, and a lack of host nation support, foreshadowing the attack. The State Department's leadership has been accused of being negligent, with a former diplomatic security agent arguing that the multiple warnings present a compelling argument for negligence.
