SUMMARY: The Benghazi attack has brought to light serious concerns about the State Department's leadership failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Emails revealed attempts by a State Department spokeswoman to remove references to prior attacks in Benghazi, citing the desire to avoid giving Congress ammunition to "beat up" on the department. This controversy underscores the negligent nature of the State Department's handling of the situation, with evidence of ignored warnings and a lack of proactive leadership. In the wake of the attack, the State Department acknowledged the inadequate protection of its staff and the severity of the Islamist threat. A classified cable sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi and the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, tasked with consulate protection. Despite the cable's alarming content, Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of it during congressional hearings. The situation was further exacerbated by the revelation of numerous attacks on foreign entities in Benghazi and a lack of security support for US personnel. The State Department's internal review stopped short of misconduct, but it did highlight the leadership's failure to address security concerns proactively. END OF SUMMARY.
