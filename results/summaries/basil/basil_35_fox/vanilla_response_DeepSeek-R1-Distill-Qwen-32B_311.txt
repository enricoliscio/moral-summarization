Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of the situation. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about the controversy surrounding the initial storyline from the Obama administration regarding the Benghazi attack. It mentions that there were documented warnings and security incidents that the State Department didn't act on. They obtained draft talking points from Victoria Nuland, who tried to remove references to prior attacks to avoid Congress criticizing the department. President Obama admitted that the staff wasn't adequately protected.

There's a classified cable from August 2012 that warned about the severe threat from Islamist militias, including AQ training camps. The cable also noted that the local security group was compromised and there was a lack of support. Hillary Clinton testified that she wasn't aware of this cable, and a former security agent said it was a "cry for help." Sen. Lindsey Graham questioned why the military knew about the cable but Clinton didn't, and Gen. Dempsey was surprised she didn't know.

The article also mentions over 200 cases of violence in Libya leading up to the attack, with foreigners increasingly targeted. A former security agent believes the warnings show negligence by State Department leadership. The State Department's internal review found a lack of proactive leadership but no misconduct.

So, to summarize, I need to cover the key points: the controversy, the warnings, Nuland's talking points, Obama's admission, the classified cable details, Clinton's lack of awareness, the military's knowledge, the security reviews, and the State Department's findings.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first mentioning the controversy, then the warnings, the talking points, Obama's statement, the cable's contents, Clinton's testimony, the military's involvement, the statistics on violence, the negligence claim, and the State Department's review.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. I'll also make sure to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.
