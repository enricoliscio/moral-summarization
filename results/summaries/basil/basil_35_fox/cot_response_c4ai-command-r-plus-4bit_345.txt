SUMMARY:
The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has sparked renewed controversy, with State Department documents revealing leadership failure and negligence in addressing documented warnings of the severe and growing Islamist threat. Emails show State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempting to downplay prior attacks in Benghazi to avoid "beat up" from Congress. A classified cable sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens warned of the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, as well as the compromising of the 17 February Brigade, tasked with consulate protection. It foreshadowed the attack, highlighting concerns about the ability to defend against a coordinated assault. Despite this, Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of the cable during congressional hearings, while military leaders were aware of its contents. The State Department's failure to respond to security requests and warnings of escalating violence in Libya, including attacks on other foreign entities, points to negligent leadership and potential misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
