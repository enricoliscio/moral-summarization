SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has been called into question, highlighting the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks, with the goal of not giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the department. Despite President Obama's acknowledgment that the Benghazi staff were not adequately protected, a review of State Department records reveals a steady stream of warnings about the growing Islamist threat in Libya. A classified cable warned of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia's presence in Benghazi, and foreshadowed the attack itself, citing concerns about the ability to defend the post in the event of a coordinated assault. The cable was apparently not seen by Secretary of State Clinton, who claimed she had no knowledge of the warning. The controversy raises questions about the leadership's failure to provide adequate protection and respond to security concerns, demonstrating a lack of proactive leadership and management ability.
