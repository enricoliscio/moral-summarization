SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has been disputed, and new evidence suggests that the State Department was negligent in responding to documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records show a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, including a significant threat of terrorist activity and the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to provide adequate protection to the consulate, and Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the warnings. The moral failure of the State Department's leadership is evident in their lack of proactive response to security concerns, prioritizing political considerations over the safety of personnel. The administration's attempts to downplay the severity of the situation and shift blame are a further indictment of their moral responsibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
