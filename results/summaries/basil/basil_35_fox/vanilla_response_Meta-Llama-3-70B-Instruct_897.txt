SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland arguing that the administration shouldn't give Congress "ammunition" to criticize her department. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, including a significant August 2012 cable that warned of a severe and growing Islamist threat. The cable, marked SECRET, identified Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi and expressed concerns about the ability to defend the consulate. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the cable, and a review found no specific finding of misconduct among senior officials.
