SUMMARY: Revelations about the Obama administration's initial response to the Benghazi attack have brought to light serious concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Emails and cables obtained by media organizations reveal that Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, attempted to downplay prior attacks in Benghazi to avoid criticism from Congress. Even President Obama conceded that the staff in Benghazi lacked adequate protection.

A classified State Department cable from August 2012, signed by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of the presence of Islamist militias and Al Qaeda training camps in Benghazi. It also highlighted the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, responsible for consulate security, and the lack of host nation security support. This cable, which has been described as a "cry for help," did not reach Secretary of State Clinton's attention, despite its urgency and significance.

Additionally, there were numerous documented attacks in Libya in the year leading up to the Benghazi attack, including incidents targeting foreigners. The State Department leadership's failure to respond to security requests and warnings has been characterized as negligent by experts, raising serious questions about their conduct and moral responsibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
