SUMMARY: New revelations about the Obama administration's initial response to the Benghazi attack highlight concerns regarding the State Department leadership's failure to act on security warnings and incidents. Documents obtained by media organizations reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to strip references to prior attacks in Benghazi, arguing that Congress should not be given ammunition to criticize the department. The administration's awareness of the threat is underscored by a classified State Department cable, which warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi, as well as the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, responsible for protecting the consulate. Despite requests for additional security, these went unanswered, and the consulate lacked host nation support. The cable also foreshadowed the attack, expressing concerns about the ability to defend the post in the event of a coordinated assault. This raises questions about the negligence of the State Department leadership, with a former diplomatic security agent suggesting their response to security requests and warnings was inadequate. The State Department has acknowledged a lack of proactive leadership and management ability but stopped short of finding misconduct.
