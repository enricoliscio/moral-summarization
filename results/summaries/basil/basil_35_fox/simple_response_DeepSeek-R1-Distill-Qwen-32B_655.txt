Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the author's perspective. 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of the situation. The key points are that there were warnings ignored, the State Department tried to downplay prior attacks, and there's a debate over negligence and responsibility.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral issues, like negligence and the failure to act despite warnings. The user wants the summary to be under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but include all the essential elements: the warnings, the State Department's actions, the congressional hearings, and the internal review findings.

I should structure it to highlight the ethical concerns, such as the administration's attempt to avoid scrutiny and the potential negligence in leadership. Also, mentioning the internal review's conclusion about the lack of proactive leadership is important for the moral framing.

I'll start by outlining the main points: resurgent controversy, documented warnings, State Department's actions to downplay prior attacks, the classified cable details, congressional testimonies, and the internal review's findings. Then, I'll condense these into a coherent summary that emphasizes the moral aspects without exceeding the word limit.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting from the controversy, moving through the warnings, the attempts to downplay, the congressional findings, and ending with the internal review's conclusion on negligence.

Finally, I'll make sure to use clear and concise language, avoiding any unnecessary details to stay within the 200-word limit while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Benghazi attack controversy has resurfaced, highlighting concerns about the Obama administration's handling of security warnings. State Department records and classified cables reveal repeated intelligence about the growing Islamist threat in Benghazi, including the presence of Al Qaeda-linked groups and compromised local security forces. Despite these warnings, the administration allegedly downplayed prior attacks and failed to provide adequate protection. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland reportedly sought to omit references to earlier incidents to avoid criticism. President Obama later acknowledged that staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she was unaware of critical security cables, sparking questions about negligence and accountability. A classified cable from August 2012, signed by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of significant security risks, including the presence of Islamist militias and the inability to defend the consulate. Internal reviews found senior officials lacked proactive leadership in addressing security concerns, though no misconduct was explicitly identified. Critics argue the administration's actions raised ethical concerns about prioritizing political optics over safety. END OF SUMMARY.
