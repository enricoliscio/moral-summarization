SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing renewed scrutiny over its handling of the Benghazi attack, with recently obtained documents revealing an attempt by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland to conceal prior security incidents and warnings from Congress. The administration's failure to act on these warnings has led to accusations of negligence and a lack of moral responsibility towards those affected by the attack.

A classified State Department cable from August 2012, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature, warned of the significant presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi, as well as the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, tasked with protecting the consulate. This cable, which did not reach Secretary of State Clinton or above the assistant secretary level, seemed to foreshadow the attack, highlighting concerns about the ability to defend the consulate.

During congressional hearings, Clinton denied knowledge of the cable, a claim questioned by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, who expressed surprise at her apparent lack of awareness.

The multiple documented warnings and security incidents leading up to the attack, including attacks on other diplomatic missions and a well-established presence of Islamist groups, raise serious moral questions about the State Department leadership's failure to act and their attempts to conceal their negligence.

END OF SUMMARY.
