SUMMARY:
The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting the State Department's negligence and failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" show efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland arguing that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to "beat up" on her department. A review of State Department records reveals a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, citing a severe and growing Islamist threat. A classified cable warned of the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, and foreshadowed the attack itself. The State Department's leadership demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in response to security concerns, with no specific finding of misconduct. President Obama acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected, and the controversy underscores concerns about the administration's failure to act on documented warnings.
