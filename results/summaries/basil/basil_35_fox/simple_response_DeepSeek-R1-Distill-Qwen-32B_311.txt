Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of the situation. The main points are the controversy over the administration's initial storyline, the State Department's concerns about not acting on warnings, and the documented security issues before the attack.

First, I should mention the resurgent controversy and the talking points from Victoria Nuland trying to downplay prior attacks. That shows an attempt to avoid blame. Then, President Obama's acknowledgment that the staff wasn't adequately protected is a key point about negligence.

Next, the classified cables and warnings from intelligence officials about the severe threat in Benghazi are important. The August 2012 cable mentioned Islamist militias and the compromised security force, which were signs of potential attacks.

Hillary Clinton's lack of knowledge about the cable during congressional hearings is another moral point, as it suggests oversight or negligence at higher levels. The State Department's internal review found a lack of proactive leadership, which supports the negligence claim.

I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's failure to act on warnings, the negligence in security, and the political implications. Keeping it under 200 words, I need to be concise but cover all these elements.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key moral issues: the administration's handling of information, the security warnings ignored, and the leadership's responsibility. I'll make sure to end with the token as instructed.

SUMMARY: The resurgent controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack highlights concerns about negligence in addressing documented warnings and security incidents. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to downplay prior attacks in talking points, avoiding giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the administration. President Obama acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were inadequately protected. Classified cables and public records revealed repeated warnings from intelligence and security officials about the severe Islamist threat in Benghazi, including the presence of Al Qaeda and compromised local security forces. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she was unaware of key security cables during congressional hearings, sparking questions about oversight. A State Department review found senior officials lacked proactive leadership in addressing security concerns, though no misconduct was specifically identified. The failure to act on warnings has raised moral questions about negligence and accountability in protecting U.S. personnel. END OF SUMMARY.
