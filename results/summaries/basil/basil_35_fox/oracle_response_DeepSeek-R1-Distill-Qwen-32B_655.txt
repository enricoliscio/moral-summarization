Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article discusses the controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack. It mentions that the State Department tried to downplay prior attacks and security warnings. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, is highlighted for stripping references to prior attacks to avoid giving Congress ammunition. The administration acknowledged that the staff wasn't adequately protected. There were multiple classified cables warning about the severe threat, including the presence of Islamist militias and Al Qaeda groups. Despite these warnings, the State Department didn't act, leading to negligence in leadership and management. The article also mentions that Secretary Clinton claimed she wasn't aware of the cables, and there's a debate over whether she should have been informed. The summary needs to include words like attack, failure, strip, threat, compromised, etc., and stay under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to cover the main issues: the State Department's attempt to downplay prior attacks, the documented warnings, the lack of action leading to negligence, and the accountability issues with Clinton. I'll make sure to use the specified moral terms to maintain the framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all key points with the required vocabulary.

SUMMARY: The Benghazi attack controversy highlights the Obama administration's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to strip references to prior attacks in Benghazi to prevent Congress from "beating up" her department. President Obama acknowledged that staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified cables revealed severe warnings about the Islamist threat, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, which ultimately carried out the assault. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to provide adequate security, with requests for help going unanswered. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of a key classified cable, sparking questions about leadership negligence. A review found senior officials lacked proactive management, though no misconduct was specifically identified. The repeated failures underscore a failure to protect U.S. personnel and interests. END OF SUMMARY.
