SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story on the Benghazi attack has been called into question, with concerns that the State Department failed to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" show efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland arguing that the administration should not give Congress "ammunition" to criticize her department. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, including an August 2012 cable that warned of a significant threat of terrorist activity. The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature, warned of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia presence in Benghazi and expressed concerns about the ability to defend the post in the event of a coordinated attack. Former diplomatic security agents argue that the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.
