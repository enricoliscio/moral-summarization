Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. Let me start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Benghazi attack and the controversy surrounding the Obama administration's handling of it. It mentions that the State Department had warnings about the threat in Benghazi but didn't act on them. There are classified cables and talking points that show the administration tried to downplay prior attacks to avoid political fallout. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, is mentioned for stripping references to previous attacks. The article also discusses the lack of protection for the consulate, the compromised security groups, and the negligence in leadership.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words like "attack," "failure," "strip," "threat," etc. I should make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens. I'll structure it by highlighting the key points: the warnings, the stripping of information, the negligence, and the political implications. I'll ensure that each moral term is appropriately included to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY: The controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack highlights a failure to act on documented warnings. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland sought to strip references to prior attacks to avoid giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the administration. Classified cables and public records reveal a growing threat from Islamist militias and Al Qaeda-linked groups in Benghazi, with warnings of a severe security situation. Despite these concerns, the consulate remained unprotected, and requests for additional security went unanswered. A classified August 2012 cable, signed by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps, as well as the compromised 17 February Brigade tasked with protecting the consulate. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she was unaware of the cable, despite its circulation within the military. A State Department review acknowledged a lack of proactive leadership and management but found no misconduct. The incident underscores negligence in leadership and a failure to provide adequate protection, leaving staff vulnerable to the assault. END OF SUMMARY.
