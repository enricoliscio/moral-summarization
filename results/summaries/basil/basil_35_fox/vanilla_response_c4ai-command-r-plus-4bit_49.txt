SUMMARY: Recently released documents and cables from the State Department have brought renewed attention to the controversy surrounding the Obama administration's response to the Benghazi attack. Emails and drafts obtained by media outlets indicate that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempted to downplay the prior security incidents and warnings in Benghazi leading up to the attack. A classified State Department cable from August 2012, sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi and highlighted concerns about the ability to defend the consulate in the event of a coordinated attack. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Clinton testified that she had no knowledge of the cable, which former diplomatic security agents have described as a "cry for help." Records also show a significant number of violent incidents in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, including attacks on other Western targets. A former diplomatic security agent has stated that the warnings present a compelling argument that the State Department leadership was negligent in their response to the security threats in Benghazi.
END OF SUMMARY.
