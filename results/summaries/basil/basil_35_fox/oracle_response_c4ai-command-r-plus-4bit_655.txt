SUMMARY: The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has come under renewed scrutiny, highlighting concerns about leadership's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. State Department records and a classified cable reveal a series of warnings about the severe and growing Islamist threat in Benghazi, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia. Despite these warnings, the leadership failed to provide adequate protection for the staff in Benghazi, leading to a devastating attack.

The classified cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature, warned of ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps within Benghazi and the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, tasked with protecting the consulate. It also highlighted the lack of host nation security support and the consulate's limited defense capabilities.

During congressional hearings, Secretary Clinton denied knowledge of the cable, despite its urgency and significance. The multiple warnings and documented security incidents present a strong case of negligence on the part of State Department leadership, even though an official review stopped short of finding misconduct.

This incident underscores the tragic consequences of leadership failure and the importance of proactive management in ensuring the protection of American diplomatic personnel.
