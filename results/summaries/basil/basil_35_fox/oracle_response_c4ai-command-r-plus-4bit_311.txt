SUMMARY: The Benghazi attack has brought to light concerns about the State Department's leadership failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Talking points obtained by media outlets revealed that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland tried to strip references to prior attacks in Benghazi, not wanting to give Congress ammunition to "beat up" on her department. This is despite warnings from intelligence and State security officials about the severe and growing Islamist threat, including a classified cable sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens warning of the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi. The cable also highlighted the compromised nature of the 17 February Brigade, responsible for protecting the consulate, and the lack of host nation security support. Records released by the House oversight committee documented over 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the assault, with foreigners increasingly targeted. The State Department's failure to respond to security requests and warnings has led to accusations of negligence and misconduct, with some arguing that the leadership demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability.
END OF SUMMARY.
