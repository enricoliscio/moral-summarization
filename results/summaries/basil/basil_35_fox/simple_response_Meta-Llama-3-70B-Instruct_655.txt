SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has come under scrutiny, with concerns that the State Department failed to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, including a significant threat of terrorist activity and the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi. Despite these warnings, the administration's initial storyline downplayed the severity of the attack, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland attempting to strip out references to prior attacks. President Obama has since acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. The moral failure lies in the administration's negligence and lack of proactive leadership, prioritizing political spin over the safety of American lives.

END OF SUMMARY.
