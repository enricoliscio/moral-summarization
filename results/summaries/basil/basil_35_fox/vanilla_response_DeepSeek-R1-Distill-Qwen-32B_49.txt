Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the controversy surrounding the initial story from the Obama administration regarding the Benghazi attack. It mentions that the State Department was concerned about leadership not acting on warnings and security incidents. They obtained draft "talking points" from The Weekly Standard and ABC News, which show Victoria Nuland trying to remove references to prior attacks in Benghazi. She didn't want to give Congress ammo to criticize the State Department. President Obama admitted that the staff in Benghazi weren't adequately protected.

There's a review of State Department records and a classified cable from Fox News. This cable, sent in August 2012, warned about the severe Islamist threat in Benghazi. It mentioned ten militias and AQ training camps. The cable also noted that the group protecting the consulate was compromised and that requests for police presence were ignored. It warned about the inability to defend the consulate in case of an attack due to limited resources.

During congressional hearings, Hillary Clinton said she wasn't aware of the cable, which some former agents called a "cry for help." Sen. Lindsey Graham questioned why the military knew about the cable but Clinton didn't. Gen. Dempsey was surprised she didn't know. The article also mentions over 200 cases of violence in Libya leading up to the attack, with foreigners increasingly targeted. A former security agent says the warnings show negligence by State leadership. The State Department's internal review found a lack of proactive leadership but no misconduct.

So, the key points are:
- The administration's initial narrative downplayed prior attacks.
- State Department officials tried to remove references to prior incidents.
- There were multiple warnings about the threat in Benghazi.
- Clinton claimed she wasn't informed about critical cables.
- There's criticism about negligence and lack of leadership.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the controversy, the warnings, Clinton's testimony, and the internal review. Make sure to include the main events and the implications of the State Department's actions.
