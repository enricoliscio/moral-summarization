Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration's handling of it. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article talks about the controversy over the initial story from the Obama administration regarding the attack. There were warnings from intelligence and State security officials that were not acted upon. I should mention the State Department's draft talking points and Victoria Nuland's role in trying to downplay prior attacks.

Next, the classified cable from August 2012 is important. It warned about the severe threat from Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, and the lack of security support. Secretary Clinton claimed she wasn't aware of this cable, which was a point of contention during congressional hearings.

Also, the article mentions that the military was informed about the cable, but Clinton wasn't. The State Department later admitted to a lack of leadership but didn't find any misconduct. I should include the internal review's findings here.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and hits all these points without getting too detailed. Keeping it under 200 words means being concise but comprehensive. I'll structure it by first introducing the controversy, then the warnings, Clinton's testimony, military's awareness, and the State Department's review.

SUMMARY: The controversy over the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, with concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings. Draft talking points from the State Department, obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News, showed efforts to downplay prior attacks in Benghazi, with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland arguing against giving Congress ammunition to criticize the department. President Obama acknowledged that the consulate staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified State Department records revealed warnings from intelligence and security officials about the growing Islamist threat in Libya, including a significant August 2012 cable detailing the presence of Islamist militias and al-Qaeda training camps in Benghazi. The cable, signed by Ambassador Chris Stevens, warned of the consulate's vulnerability and lack of host nation support. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed she was unaware of the cable during congressional hearings, despite the military being informed. A former diplomatic security agent criticized the State Department's leadership for negligence. An internal review found a lack of proactive leadership but no misconduct. END OF SUMMARY.
