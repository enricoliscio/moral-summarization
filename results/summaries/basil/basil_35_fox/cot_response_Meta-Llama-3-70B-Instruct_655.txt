SUMMARY:
The Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, detailing the severe and growing Islamist threat. The cables warned of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia's presence in Benghazi, and a key section foreshadowed the attack itself, citing inadequate security measures and a lack of host nation support. Despite this, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the warnings, which former diplomatic security agents have described as a "cry for help." The State Department's leadership has been accused of negligent and inadequate response to security concerns, with some senior officials demonstrating a lack of proactive leadership and management ability. The administration's actions have been criticized as a failure to protect the staff in Benghazi. END OF SUMMARY.
