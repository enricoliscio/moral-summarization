SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's initial story on the Benghazi attack has resurfaced, highlighting concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi. A classified State Department cable, sent in August 2012, warned of a severe and growing Islamist threat, including the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia. The cable also expressed concerns about the ability to defend the consulate in the event of a coordinated attack. Despite these warnings, Secretary of State Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the cable. Congressional hearings revealed a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya. The controversy raises questions about the State Department's leadership and its failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help.
