SUMMARY:
The Obama administration's initial storyline on the Benghazi attack has been disputed, highlighting concerns about the State Department's leadership failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Classified cables and records show a steady stream of warnings from intelligence and security officials on the ground in Libya, highlighting the severe and growing Islamist threat. Despite these warnings, the administration failed to provide adequate protection to the staff in Benghazi, leading to a "cry for help" from the Regional Security Officer. The State Department's leadership has been accused of being negligent and demonstrating a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in response to security concerns. The administration's efforts to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi have been seen as an attempt to avoid being "beaten up" by Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
