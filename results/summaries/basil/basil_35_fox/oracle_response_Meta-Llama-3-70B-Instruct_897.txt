SUMMARY:

The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack has come under scrutiny, with concerns about the State Department's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft "talking points" showed efforts to strip out references to prior attacks, with the goal of not giving Congress "ammunition" to criticize the department. President Obama acknowledged that the staff in Benghazi were not adequately protected. Classified cables and records reveal a steady stream of warnings about the growing Islamist threat, including a significant warning about terrorist activity and compromised security. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to provide adequate protection, leading to the assault. The administration's response has been criticized as negligent, with a lack of proactive leadership and management ability. The controversy raises questions about the administration's accountability and responsibility for the failure to protect American lives.
