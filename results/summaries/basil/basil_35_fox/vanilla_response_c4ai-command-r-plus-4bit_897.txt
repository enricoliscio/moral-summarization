SUMMARY: Newly obtained documents and testimony reveal that the State Department was warned about security threats in Benghazi prior to the 2012 attack that killed four Americans. A classified cable sent by Ambassador Chris Stevens warned of the presence of Islamist militias and AQ training camps in Benghazi and requested additional security support. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to provide adequate protection for the consulate. During congressional hearings, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denied knowledge of the cable, while military leaders expressed surprise that she was not informed. The documents also reveal a pattern of violence and security incidents in the lead-up to the attack, including attacks on other Western targets. The revelations raise questions about the State Department's leadership and whether they ignored warnings and failed to take necessary action to protect American personnel.
END OF SUMMARY.
