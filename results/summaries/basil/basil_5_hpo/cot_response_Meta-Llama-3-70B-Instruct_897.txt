SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization has approved a resolution condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate its racist elements. NAACP leaders claim that the tea party has welcomed white supremacists and bigots into their ranks, and that this acceptance has led to a negative and dangerous environment. Tea party activists, including Sarah Palin, have disputed these claims, calling them false and appalling. The NAACP resolution aims to empower the tea party to take responsibility and address the racism within its movement. The debate highlights the need for the tea party to be responsible members of democracy and ensure they don't tolerate bigotry or racism. END OF SUMMARY.
