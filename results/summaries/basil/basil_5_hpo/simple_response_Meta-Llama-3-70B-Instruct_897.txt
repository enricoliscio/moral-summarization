SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has condemned racism within the tea party movement, accusing its activists of tolerating bigotry. The NAACP's resolution, adopted at its annual convention, calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its ranks. Tea party organizers have disputed the claims, with Sarah Palin saying the accusations are "false and appalling." However, NAACP leaders argue that the movement has accepted and welcomed white supremacists, and that it's time for the tea party to take responsibility and ensure it doesn't tolerate bigotry. The resolution comes after previous incidents of racism, including reports of racial epithets being yelled at black congressmen. The NAACP's move is seen as a call to action, urging the tea party to examine itself and reject racist elements. By doing so, the NAACP hopes to empower the tea party to become a more responsible and inclusive movement.
