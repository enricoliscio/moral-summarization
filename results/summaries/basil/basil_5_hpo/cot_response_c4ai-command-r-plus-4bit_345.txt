SUMMARY: 
Leaders of the NAACP accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, and adopted a resolution condemning these issues within the movement. The resolution calls on the tea party to repudiate racism and be responsible members of democracy, not tolerating bigots or bigotry among their members. NAACP leaders say they have witnessed tea party activists welcoming white supremacists into their organizations and claim that the movement has become dangerous, with a small percentage of people believing their country has been taken away from them. Tea party activists dispute these claims, stating that the movement is diverse and united against higher taxes and limited government. They further claim that accusations of racism are false and appalling. The debate has brought attention to the moral issues of tolerance, activism, and extremist behavior in American politics.
