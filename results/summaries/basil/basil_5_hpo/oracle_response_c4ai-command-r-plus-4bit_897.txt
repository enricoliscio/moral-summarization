SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks. The organization's leaders adopted a resolution during their annual convention in Kansas City, calling on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its movement. The resolution sparked debate, with tea party activists disputing the claims and calling for the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. NAACP leaders maintained that they do not have an issue with the tea party's existence but with its acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists. They encouraged the tea party to be responsible and ensure that bigotry and racism are not tolerated among their members. Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, called the claims false and appalling, stating that tea party activists do not judge people by the color of their skin. The final wording of the resolution will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board of directors in October. The controversy highlights ongoing concerns about the presence of extremist and racist elements within political movements.
