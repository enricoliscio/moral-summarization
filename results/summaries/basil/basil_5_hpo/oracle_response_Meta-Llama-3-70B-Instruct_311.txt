SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization has approved a resolution condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. NAACP leaders argue that the tea party's acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists is a major concern, and that it's time for the movement to take responsibility and ensure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members. Tea party activists, on the other hand, dispute claims of racism, calling them unfounded and false. They argue that the movement is made up of a diverse group of people upset with the country's direction, and that there is no evidence of racism within their ranks. The NAACP's resolution has sparked a heated debate, with some calling on the organization to withdraw the proposal. END OF SUMMARY.
