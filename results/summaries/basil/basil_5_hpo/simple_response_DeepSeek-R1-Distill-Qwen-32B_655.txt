Okay, so the user has given me a news article about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating racism. They want me to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture both sides of the argument without bias.

First, I should identify the main points. The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party. They're saying the movement is welcoming bigots. The Tea Party is disputing this, calling it unfounded and false. There's mention of past incidents, like the health care debate, where some claimed racism. Also, the NAACP's stance is about holding the Tea Party accountable, while the Tea Party feels wrongly accused.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the NAACP's action, their reasons, the Tea Party's response, and the context of past allegations. Make sure to include quotes or paraphrases that highlight the moral stances from both sides. Avoid taking sides, just present the facts as they are framed in the article.

Wait, the user mentioned it's a news summarizer and a moral expert. So I need to ensure the moral implications are clear. The NAACP is framing the issue as a matter of responsibility and inclusion, while the Tea Party sees it as an unfair attack. I should balance both perspectives without leaning too much one way.

Also, the summary needs to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start with "SUMMARY:". Keep it concise but comprehensive. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed. Check the word count to stay within limits.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it all together, ensuring it flows logically and covers all necessary points while preserving the moral framing as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and adopted a resolution condemning racism within the movement during its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to reject racist elements, while Tea Party organizers denied the allegations, calling them unfounded and false. NAACP leaders argue that the Tea Party must take responsibility for excluding white supremacists, emphasizing their commitment to racial justice. Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, dismissed the claims as "appalling," asserting that the movement is about limited government and patriotism, not racism. The NAACP's resolution highlights concerns about the Tea Party's inclusivity and its potential to attract extremist groups. Meanwhile, Tea Party activists maintain that the accusations are baseless and distract from their focus on fiscal conservatism and individual rights. The debate reflects broader tensions over the political movement's image and its alignment with anti-racist values. END OF SUMMARY.
