Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing of the original article. The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. The NAACP passed a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party. Tea Party members denied the accusations and called for the resolution to be withdrawn. The article mentions specific terms like bigotry, racism, repudiate, racists, false, educate, responsible, tolerate, etc.

I should start by identifying the key events: the resolution's adoption, the Tea Party's response, the debate details, and the context of previous accusations. I need to make sure to include as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning the NAACP's action, the Tea Party's denial, the resolution's call for repudiating racism, and the context of past incidents. I'll also include the NAACP's stance on educating their members and the Tea Party's responsibility to not tolerate bigots.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, is concise, and stays under 200 words. I'll check each sentence to see if it includes the necessary moral terms and accurately reflects the article's content without adding personal opinions.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved as per the user's request.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution during its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements within its ranks, while Tea Party organizers denied the allegations, calling them false and unfounded. NAACP leaders emphasized the need for the Tea Party to become responsible members of democracy and reject white supremacists. Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, condemned the NAACP's claims, stating they were saddened by the accusations. The resolution also aims to educate the public about the movement's potential dangers, though its final wording remains pending approval. Tea Party activists, like Alex Poulter, argued the movement is diverse and denied any evidence of racism. The debate highlights tensions between the NAACP's push for accountability and the Tea Party's defense against accusations of intolerance. END OF SUMMARY.
