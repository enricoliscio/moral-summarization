SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during the NAACP's annual convention, condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate its racist elements. The NAACP claims that the tea party has welcomed white supremacists into their organizations, and that their acceptance of bigotry is appalling. Tea party organizers dispute the allegations, calling them unfounded and claiming that the movement is made up of a diverse group of people who are upset with the government. However, the NAACP points to instances of racism, including the use of racial epithets and spitting on black congressmen. The NAACP urges the tea party to stand up against bigotry and take responsibility for their actions. By tolerating racism, the tea party is allowing extremist groups to latch on to their movement, making it hard to achieve anything positive. END OF SUMMARY.
