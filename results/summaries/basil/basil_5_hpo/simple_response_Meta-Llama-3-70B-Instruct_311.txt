SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during the NAACP's annual convention, calling on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities. The resolution was met with resistance from tea party organizers, who disputed claims of racism and called on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. NAACP leaders argue that the tea party has accepted and welcomed white supremacists into their organizations, which has led to a dangerous and divisive environment. Tea party activists, on the other hand, claim that their movement is diverse and upset with the current state of the country, with no evidence of racism. The NAACP's resolution aims to hold the tea party accountable for its actions and to promote a more inclusive and respectful political discourse.
