Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP and the Tea Party. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by saying that the NAACP, which is the country's largest civil rights organization, accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry. They adopted a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party during their annual convention in Kansas City. A spokesman, Chris Fleming, mentioned this. 

Tea Party organizers are disputing these claims. They want the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The debate wasn't open to the public, but the resolution's final version calls on the Tea Party to repudiate any racist elements. Hilary Shelton from the NAACP's Washington bureau hopes this will make the Tea Party examine itself.

Sarah Palin, a Tea Party supporter, was saddened by the NAACP's claims, saying they falsely accuse patriotic Americans of being racists. She called the accusations appalling.

The resolution's final wording isn't out yet; it needs approval from the NAACP's national board in October. The original resolution aimed to educate the NAACP membership and the community about the Tea Party movement, suggesting it could become dangerous for some people who feel the country has been taken away from them.

NAACP President Ben Jealous said they don't have a problem with the Tea Party's existence but are against their acceptance of white supremacists. Tea Party activist Alex Poulter disputed the allegations, saying the movement is diverse and there's no evidence of racism. Another group, the St. Louis Tea Party, also asked the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.

The Tea Party isn't affiliated with major parties but supports less government, free markets, lower taxes, individual rights, and political activism. They've been accused of racism before, especially during the health care debate when some demonstrators allegedly used racial epithets. Some lawmakers were spit on, but conservatives denied the claims.

Anita L. Russell, the NAACP branch president, thinks the resolution is focusing on the negative and helping extremist groups.

So, putting it all together, the summary should include the NAACP's resolution, the Tea Party's response, Sarah Palin's reaction, the resolution's content, the NAACP's stance, the Tea Party's diversity claim, and the historical context of racism accusations.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention the accusation, the resolution, the responses from both sides, and the context of past racism claims.

The NAACP, the nation's largest civil rights organization, has condemned the Tea Party movement for tolerating racism, adopting a resolution during its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to reject racist elements, though Tea Party organizers deny the allegations and demand the resolution be withdrawn. NAACP President Ben Jealous stated the group has no issue with the Tea Party's existence but opposes its acceptance of white supremacists. Tea Party activists, including Sarah Palin, claim the accusations are unfounded and harmful. The resolution highlights concerns about the movement's potential to become dangerous, referencing past incidents where Tea Party supporters were accused of racism during the health care debate. The NAACP's stance aims to hold the Tea Party accountable, while Tea Party leaders argue the claims are baseless and distract from their focus on limited government and individual rights. END OF SUMMARY.
