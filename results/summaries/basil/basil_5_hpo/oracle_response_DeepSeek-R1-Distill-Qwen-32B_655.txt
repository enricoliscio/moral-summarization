Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The NAACP accused the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They adopted a resolution condemning this. The Tea Party disputed these claims, calling them false and unfounded. They want the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate people about the movement's potential dangers and urges the Tea Party to take responsibility. They mention that while they don't oppose the Tea Party's existence, they object to the acceptance of white supremacists. The Tea Party activists argue they're a diverse group and have seen no evidence of racism. There's also mention of past incidents where Tea Party supporters were accused of racism, like the health care debate. The NAACP believes focusing on these negatives helps extremist groups.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll start by stating the NAACP's accusation, their resolution, and the Tea Party's response. I'll include words like "condemning," "tolerating," "racism," "bigotry," "false," "unfounded," "repudiate," "responsible," "acceptance," "welcoming," "educate," "latching," and "pulling." I'll structure it to show both sides and the context of past incidents. Let me make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Okay, I think this captures the essence while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution condemning such behavior during its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities, while the NAACP aims to educate its membership about the movement's potential dangers. Tea party organizers disputed the claims, labeling them false and unfounded, and demanded the resolution be withdrawn. NAACP President Ben Jealous emphasized the need for the tea party to become responsible members of democracy and reject bigots within their ranks. Tea party supporters, like Sarah Palin, denied the accusations, calling them appalling. Activists argued the movement is diverse and accused the NAACP of running with unfounded claims. The resolution highlights concerns about the tea party's acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists, while the NAACP warns of the movement's potential to become more dangerous. Tea party groups, like the St. Louis Tea Party, issued their own resolutions opposing the NAACP's action. The debate reflects ongoing tensions over racism accusations, with the NAACP asserting that focusing on these issues empowers extremist groups. END OF SUMMARY.
