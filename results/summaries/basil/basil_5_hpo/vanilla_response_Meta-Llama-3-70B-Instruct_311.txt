SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has approved a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party movement. The resolution, adopted during the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its ranks. Tea Party organizers dispute claims of racism, with some calling the allegations "unfounded" and "false." The NAACP resolution is seen as an attempt to hold the Tea Party accountable for tolerating bigotry and racism within its membership. The debate has sparked a heated response, with Tea Party supporters like Sarah Palin denouncing the NAACP's claims as "appalling" and "false." The resolution's final wording will be released in October, pending approval by the NAACP's national board of directors.

END OF SUMMARY.
