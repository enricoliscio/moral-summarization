SUMMARY: Leaders of the NAACP have accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks. The organization's annual convention saw the adoption of a resolution condemning these issues within the tea party. The resolution calls on the tea party to repudiate racism and white supremacists in their midst. NAACP leaders say they have no problem with the tea party's existence but take issue with their acceptance and welcoming of bigots and racists. Tea party activists dispute these allegations, claiming they are diverse and inclusive. They say the accusations are unfounded and false. The NAACP's resolution has sparked debate and controversy, with some calling for its withdrawal, while others defend it as necessary to hold the tea party accountable for the actions of its members. The NAACP stands by its resolution, saying it is important to educate people about the dangers of tolerating bigotry and racism in any form. END OF SUMMARY.
