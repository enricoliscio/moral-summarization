Alright, so I need to help summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They adopted a resolution during their convention in Kansas City. The Tea Party activists are disputing these claims, calling them false and are asking the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.

I should note the main actors: NAACP leaders, Tea Party organizers, Sarah Palin, and some specific incidents mentioned, like the health care debate where racial epithets were allegedly used. Also, the resolution's content is importantâ€”condemning racism within the Tea Party and urging them to reject bigots.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. So, I'll mention the resolution, the NAACP's stance, the Tea Party's response, and perhaps a brief mention of the incident with the congressmen to provide context on why the NAACP is taking this action.

I should structure it by first stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's reaction, and include the resolution's call for accountability. Also, mention that the Tea Party is diverse and denies racism, and that the resolution's final version will be decided later.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point to stay within the word limit. Make sure to include the key elements: who, what, when, where, why, and the opposing viewpoints.

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring it's clear and covers all main points without unnecessary details.
