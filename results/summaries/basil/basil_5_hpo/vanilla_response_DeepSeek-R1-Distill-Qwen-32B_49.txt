Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating racism. They adopted a resolution at their convention in Kansas City. Tea Party leaders are disputing this, saying it's false and calling for the resolution to be withdrawn.

I should note the key points: NAACP's resolution, the Tea Party's response, Sarah Palin's statement, and the context of past racism allegations.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll mention the resolution's main points, the accusations, the Tea Party's defense, and the underlying issues like the health care debate.

I should structure it in a clear, straightforward manner, making sure to include all important elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and adopted a resolution condemning racism within the movement during its annual convention in Kansas City. Tea Party organizers denied the claims, calling them false and demanding the resolution be withdrawn. The resolution urges the Tea Party to reject racist elements and activities, while the NAACP emphasized its concern with the movement's acceptance of white supremacists. Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, condemned the accusations as baseless. The resolution highlights the need for the Tea Party to address its tolerance of bigots and become responsible members of democracy. Tea Party activists, such as Alex Poulter, dismissed the allegations, stating the movement is diverse and no evidence of racism exists. The debate over racism within the Tea Party has been ongoing, particularly following incidents during the health care debate. The NAACP resolution aims to address these concerns and promote accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
