SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks. The NAACP's resolution, passed during its annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the tea party to repudiate racism and white supremacists in its midst. NAACP leaders Ben Jealous and Hilary Shelton argue that while they do not have an issue with the tea party's existence, they cannot condone the movement's acceptance of discriminatory beliefs and practices. Tea party activists, such as Alex Poulter, deny these accusations, claiming that the movement is diverse and inclusive. They argue that the NAACP's claims are unfounded and based on false assumptions. The tea party's philosophy centers on limited government, free markets, individual rights, and political activism. However, the movement has faced persistent allegations of racism, particularly during the health care debate when several black congressmen reported being subjected to racial epithets and even physical assault. The NAACP's resolution aims to hold the tea party accountable for its members' actions, encouraging them to be responsible members of democracy who actively reject bigotry and extremism.
