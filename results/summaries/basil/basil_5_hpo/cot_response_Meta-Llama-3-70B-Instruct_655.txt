SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during the NAACP's annual convention, condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate its racist elements. Tea party organizers disputed the claims, saying they are unfounded and that the movement is made up of a diverse group of people who are upset with the country's direction. However, the NAACP cited instances of racist behavior, including the use of racial epithets and spitting on a black congressman. The NAACP president said the organization has no problem with the tea party's existence, but rather with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations. The resolution aims to empower the tea party to take responsibility and ensure they don't tolerate bigotry or racism. END OF SUMMARY.
