Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating racism. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I need to include. I should make sure to use as many of those as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racism in the Tea Party. They used words like "tolerating bigotry" and "racism." The Tea Party disputed these claims, calling them "unfounded" and "accusations." Sarah Palin was "saddened" by the claims. The NAACP wants to "educate" people about the movement's dangers. There's mention of "white supremacists" and "bigots." The Tea Party activists argue they're a "diverse group" and that the allegations are "unfounded."

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "tolerating," "bigotry," "racism," "saddened," "educate," "movement," "tolerate," "bigots," "unfounded," "accusations," "activism," and maybe "latching." I should structure it to show both sides: the NAACP's stance and the Tea Party's rebuttal.

I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response. Mention the resolution's call to "repudiate racist elements." Include Sarah Palin's reaction. Note that the resolution's full text isn't out yet but highlights the concern about the movement becoming dangerous. The NAACP's president emphasizes not opposing the Tea Party's existence but their tolerance of bigots. Tea Party activists deny the allegations, calling them unfounded. They argue they're a diverse group focused on political activism. The NAACP's president, Ben Jealous, wants them to take responsibility.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence includes the moral terms without making it sound forced. The summary should reflect the conflict and the moral language used by both sides.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution condemning such behavior at its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements within the movement, while Tea Party organizers dispute these claims, calling them unfounded and accusing the NAACP of spreading false accusations. Sarah Palin, a vocal Tea Party supporter, expressed sadness over the allegations, denouncing the claims as false and appalling. The NAACP aims to educate its membership about the potential dangers of the Tea Party movement, particularly its tolerance of bigots and white supremacists. Tea Party activists, however, argue they are a diverse group focused on political activism, not racism. NAACP President Ben Jealous emphasized the need for the Tea Party to take responsibility and ensure it does not welcome racists. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between the NAACP and the Tea Party over issues of racism and activism. END OF SUMMARY.
