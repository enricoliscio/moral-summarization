Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The NAACP is accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They passed a resolution against it, and the Tea Party is denying the allegations. 

I need to capture both sides of the story. The NAACP's stance is that they're holding the Tea Party accountable, while the Tea Party claims the accusations are unfounded. It's important to mention the resolution's content, like calling on the Tea Party to reject racists and educate their members. Also, the Tea Party's response, with Sarah Palin's statement, should be included.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and balanced. I'll start by stating the accusation, then the resolution details, followed by the Tea Party's denial and their counterpoints. I'll end with the broader context of the debate. 

Let me structure it: first the accusation, then the resolution's content, the Tea Party's response, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by emphasizing the NAACP's call for responsibility and the Tea Party's rejection of the claims as false.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, each sentence leading to the next without unnecessary details. That should cover all the necessary points while staying within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution at its annual convention in Kansas City to condemn such behavior within the movement. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to reject racist elements and activities, while the NAACP also plans to educate its members about the potential dangers of the movement. Tea Party leaders, including Sarah Palin, denied the allegations, calling them false and appalling. They argue that the movement is diverse and made up of individuals concerned with government overreach, not racism. NAACP President Ben Jealous emphasized that the organization does not oppose the Tea Party's existence but objects to its acceptance of white supremacists. The debate over the resolution highlights ongoing tensions between the groups, with the NAACP urging accountability and the Tea Party dismissing the claims as unfounded. The resolution's final wording will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board in October. END OF SUMMARY.
