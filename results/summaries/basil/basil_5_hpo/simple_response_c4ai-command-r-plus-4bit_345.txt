SUMMARY: During its annual convention in Kansas City, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement and adopted a resolution condemning such actions. The NAACP's resolution sparked debate and received pushback from tea party organizers and supporters, who disputed the claims of racism and called for the resolution's withdrawal. The resolution highlights the tension between the NAACP's commitment to racial equality and the tea party's political philosophy of limited government and individual rights. NAACP leaders, such as Ben Jealous and Hilary Shelton, expressed concern about the presence of white supremacists within the tea party and encouraged the movement to take responsibility for ensuring that bigotry and racism are not tolerated. Tea party activists, like Alex Poulter, denied the presence of racism within their ranks and felt that the accusations were unfounded. The St. Louis Tea Party issued its own resolution calling on the NAACP to retract its statement. This incident showcases the competing values of racial justice and political ideology in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
