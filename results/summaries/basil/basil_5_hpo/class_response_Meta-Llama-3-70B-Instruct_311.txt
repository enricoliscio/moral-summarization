SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization's leaders claim that the tea party has welcomed white supremacists into their ranks, and that this acceptance is a threat to democracy. The NAACP has adopted a resolution calling on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within their movement. Tea party organizers have disputed the claims, calling them unfounded and appalling. The NAACP's president, Ben Jealous, stated that the organization is not opposed to the tea party's existence, but rather their acceptance of bigotry. The resolution aims to educate the community about the dangers of tolerating racism and to encourage the tea party to stand up against bigotry. The debate has sparked a heated response from tea party activists, with some calling on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. END OF SUMMARY.
