SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during the NAACP's annual convention, calling on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. The NAACP claims that the tea party's acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations is a major concern. Tea party activists, however, disputed the allegations, calling them unfounded and appalling. The NAACP's resolution aims to empower the tea party to take responsibility and ensure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members. The debate highlights the need for the tea party to be responsible members of democracy and address the extremist elements within their movement. END OF SUMMARY.
