Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP is accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They passed a resolution condemning this. The Tea Party is disputing these claims, calling them unfounded and accusing the NAACP of spreading false accusations. 

I should note the key points: the NAACP's resolution, the Tea Party's response, the accusations of racism, the call for the Tea Party to repudiate bigots, and the debate around whether the claims are true or not. 

I need to include words like "tolerating," "bigotry," "racism," "saddened," "judge," "educate," "movement," "stand," "tolerate," "bigots," "welcoming," "unfounded," "accusations," "activism," "spit," "pulling," "looking," "latching." 

I'll structure the summary to mention the NAACP's action, the Tea Party's reaction, the moral implications, and the ongoing debate. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

I'll start by stating the NAACP's resolution, then the Tea Party's denial. I'll mention the specific morally charged terms as they come up. I should also include Sarah Palin's response and the incident with the congressmen being spat on. 

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, highlighting the conflict and the moral accusations from both sides. I'll avoid adding any new information not in the article and stick to the facts presented.

Finally, I'll review to ensure all the morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution at its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution condemns the tea party movement for welcoming white supremacists and calls on its members to repudiate racist elements. Tea party leaders, including Alex Poulter, disputed these claims, labeling them unfounded and accusing the NAACP of spreading false accusations. Sarah Palin, a tea party supporter, expressed sadness over the allegations, calling them false and appalling. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members about the potential dangers of the tea party movement and urges it to become responsible members of democracy. The debate over racism within the tea party has been contentious, with some accusing the movement of judging people by the color of their skin. The NAACP hopes the resolution will encourage the tea party to address its internal issues, while tea party activists argue they are a diverse group focused on limited government and individual rights. The moral framing of the issue highlights the tension between accusations of racism and the tea party's emphasis on activism and patriotism. END OF SUMMARY.
