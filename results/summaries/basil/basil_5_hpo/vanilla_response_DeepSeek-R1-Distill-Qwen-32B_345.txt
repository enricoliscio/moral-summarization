Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP and the Tea Party. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that the NAACP, the largest civil rights organization, accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and approved a resolution against racism within the Tea Party. This happened at their annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements. Tea Party organizers are disputing these claims and want the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.

The resolution's final version says it's calling on the Tea Party and all good people to reject racism. Hilary Shelton from the NAACP hopes this will make the Tea Party examine itself. Sarah Palin, a Tea Party supporter, is upset and says the claims are false and appalling. The NAACP's president, Ben Jealous, clarifies that they don't have a problem with the Tea Party's existence but with their acceptance of white supremacists. Tea Party activists like Alex Poulter argue that there's no evidence of racism in their movement.

The article also mentions that the Tea Party has faced accusations of racism before, especially during the health care debate when some demonstrators were accused of using racial epithets. The NAACP's local president, Anita Russell, thinks the focus on negatives helps extremist groups.

So, to summarize, the key points are: NAACP condemns Tea Party for racism, Tea Party denies it, resolution calls for rejecting racists, Palin's response, NAACP's stance on existence vs. white supremacists, and past accusations during health care debate.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to mention the resolution, the accusations, the responses from both sides, and the context of past incidents.
