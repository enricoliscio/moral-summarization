SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks, sparking a fierce debate. The civil rights organization adopted a resolution condemning racism within the tea party, calling on its members to repudiate any racist elements. NAACP leaders argued that the tea party welcomes white supremacists and that it is the responsibility of the movement to ensure it does not tolerate bigotry or accept members with hateful ideologies. Tea party activists vehemently denied the accusations, claiming they are diverse and inclusive. Sarah Palin defended the movement, calling the NAACP's claims false and appalling. The resolution has sparked a heated debate, with tea party supporters demanding its withdrawal.
