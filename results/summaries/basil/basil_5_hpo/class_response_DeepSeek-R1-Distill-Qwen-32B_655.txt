Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words provided and keep the summary under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP is accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution against them. The Tea Party is disputing these claims, calling them unfounded and accusing the NAACP of spreading false accusations. There's mention of past incidents where racism was alleged, like during the health care debate. 

I need to make sure I include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "tolerating," "bigotry," "racism," "saddened," "judge," "educate," "movement," "stand," "tolerate," "bigots," "welcoming," "unfounded," "accusations," "activism," "spit," "pulling," "looking," "latching." 

I should structure the summary to highlight the NAACP's stance and the Tea Party's response, ensuring the moral tone is maintained. I'll start by stating the NAACP's accusation, then mention the resolution and the Tea Party's denial. I'll include the debate details and the context of past incidents. Finally, I'll note the NAACP's call for accountability and the Tea Party's request to withdraw the resolution.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key points without getting bogged down in details. Let me draft this, making sure each sentence incorporates the moral language where appropriate.

SUMMARY: The NAACP accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution condemning the movement during its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements, though Tea Party organizers disputed the claims, calling them unfounded and urging the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. NAACP leaders emphasized the need for the Tea Party to take responsibility and reject bigots within its ranks, while Tea Party supporters argued the accusations were baseless and damaging. The debate highlighted tensions over the movement's inclusivity and its association with white supremacists. NAACP President Ben Jealous stressed the importance of accountability, while Tea Party activists like Alex Poulter maintained the movement was diverse and focused on limited government and individual rights. The resolution also referenced past incidents, such as racial epithets during the health care debate, though Tea Party supporters denied these allegations. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the public about the potential dangers of the Tea Party's ideology, while Tea Party groups like the St. Louis Tea Party issued their own resolutions opposing the NAACP's stance. END OF SUMMARY.
