Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about the NAACP accusing Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism. They passed a resolution condemning this during their convention. The Tea Party disputes these claims, calling them false and appalling. Sarah Palin and other Tea Party members deny the allegations, saying there's no evidence of racism. The NAACP's resolution aims to make the Tea Party accountable and stop welcoming bigots. The Tea Party is described as a diverse group focused on limited government and individual rights, but they've faced occasional racism accusations, especially during the health care debate. The NAACP believes the resolution will encourage self-reflection and responsibility within the Tea Party.

I need to capture the moral stance here. The NAACP is framing the Tea Party as tolerant of racism, while the Tea Party is framing the accusations as unfounded and harmful. I should mention both sides and the underlying issues of tolerance versus accusation.

Let me structure the summary to include the main points: NAACP's resolution, Tea Party's response, the debate's context, and the implications of the resolution. I'll keep it under 200 words, focusing on the moral arguments from both sides.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the moral framing without bias, just presenting both perspectives as they are presented in the article.
