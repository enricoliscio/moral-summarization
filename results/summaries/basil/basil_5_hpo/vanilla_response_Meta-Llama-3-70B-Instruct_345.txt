SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party movement. The resolution, adopted during the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its ranks. NAACP leaders accuse Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry, while Tea Party organizers dispute claims of racism and call on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The debate centers around allegations of racism within the Tea Party, with some accusing the movement of welcoming white supremacists. Tea Party activists deny these claims, saying the movement is diverse and focused on issues like limited government and lower taxes. The resolution is seen as a call to action for the Tea Party to address concerns about racism within its ranks.
