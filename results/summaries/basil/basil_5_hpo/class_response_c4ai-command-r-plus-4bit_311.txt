SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks, sparking a debate over the presence of racist elements in the movement. The civil rights organization's resolution condemns racism in the tea party and calls on its leaders to repudiate such elements. NAACP leaders argue that the tea party welcomes white supremacists and that there is evidence of racism within the movement, while tea party activists strongly dispute these claims, calling them unfounded accusations. The resolution has stirred controversy, with Sarah Palin expressing sadness over the suggestion that tea party activists judge people based on the color of their skin. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members about the true nature of the tea party movement and to encourage the movement to stand against bigotry and racism. It highlights the concern that a small percentage of people within the movement may be pulling others towards negative and extremist views.
