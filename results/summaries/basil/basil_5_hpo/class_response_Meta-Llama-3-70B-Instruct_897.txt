SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization's leaders claim that the tea party has welcomed white supremacists and failed to repudiate racist elements. The NAACP's resolution, adopted during their annual convention, calls on the tea party to stand up against bigotry and racism. Tea party organizers, however, dispute the claims, calling them unfounded and appalling. They argue that their movement is about limited government and lower taxes, not racism. The NAACP's president, Ben Jealous, emphasized that the organization has no issue with the tea party's existence, but rather with their acceptance of bigots and bigotry. The debate highlights the need for the tea party to take responsibility and educate its members about the dangers of racism. By tolerating racism, the tea party risks becoming a breeding ground for extremist groups. END OF SUMMARY.
