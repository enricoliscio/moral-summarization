Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want a summary that includes the morally charged words from the original text. 

Looking at the article, it's about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. The Tea Party is disputing these claims. I need to identify all the single words that carry moral weight. Words like "tolerating," "condemning," "bigotry," "racism," "false," "appalling," "unfounded," "extremist," and "negative" come to mind. These words are crucial because they convey the moral judgment in the article.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I need to make sure to include those morally framed words to maintain the original tone. I'll start by stating the NAACP's accusation, then mention the Tea Party's response. I'll include Sarah Palin's reaction and the ongoing debate. It's important to highlight both sides and the underlying issues they're facing.

I should also note that the resolution isn't final yet and that the Tea Party is diverse but accused of welcoming white supremacists. Ending with the NAACP's call for accountability and the Tea Party's denial wraps up the summary nicely. I need to keep the language clear and direct, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

**STEP 1:**

\*tolerating  
\*condemning  
\*bigotry  
\*racism  
\*false  
\*appalling  
\*unfounded  
\*extremist  
\*negative  

**SUMMARY:**  
The NAACP accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution condemning the movement. Tea Party organizers denied the claims, calling them false and appalling. NAACP leaders emphasized the need for the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements within its ranks, while Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, argued that the accusations were unfounded and damaging. The resolution, which has not yet been finalized, highlights concerns about the Tea Party's tolerance of white supremacists and its potential to become more dangerous. Tea Party activists, who advocate for less government and lower taxes, dispute the allegations, asserting that the movement is diverse and focused on legitimate political issues. The debate reflects broader tensions over the moral and political framing of the Tea Party's activities.  
END OF SUMMARY.
