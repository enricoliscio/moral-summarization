SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has condemned racism within the tea party movement, accusing activists of tolerating bigotry and racism. The resolution, adopted during their annual convention, calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within their ranks. NAACP leaders argue that the movement's acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists is unacceptable and that it's time for the tea party to be responsible members of democracy and ensure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry. Tea party activists, including Sarah Palin, have disputed the claims, calling them false and appalling. However, the NAACP points to instances of racism, including racial epithets and spitting incidents, as evidence of the problem. The organization hopes the resolution will empower the tea party to examine itself and take action against racist elements. The NAACP's move is seen as a stand against bigotry and a call to action for the tea party to become more responsible and inclusive.
