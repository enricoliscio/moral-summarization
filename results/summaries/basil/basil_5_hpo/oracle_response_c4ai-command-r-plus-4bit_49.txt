SUMMARY: Tea party activists have been accused of tolerating bigotry and racism by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which has adopted a resolution condemning such actions within the movement. The NAACP's resolution calls on the tea party to repudiate racism and educate its members about the dangers of tolerating bigotry and welcoming white supremacists into their organizations. Tea party activists dispute the claims of racism, with Sarah Palin calling them false and appalling. The NAACP also highlights the need for the tea party to be responsible and ensure that extremist groups are not latching onto their movement. The final wording of the resolution is pending approval by the NAACP's national board of directors. The debate has sparked a discussion about the role of the tea party in promoting responsible and inclusive political activism.
