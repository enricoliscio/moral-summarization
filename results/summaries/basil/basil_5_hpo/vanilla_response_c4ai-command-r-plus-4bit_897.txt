SUMMARY: The NAACP accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks during its annual convention in Kansas City. The NAACP's resolution sparked debate and was met with opposition from tea party activists, who disputed the allegations and called for the resolution to be withdrawn. The resolution's supporters argued that the tea party movement has welcomed white supremacists and that it is necessary to call out and repudiate racist elements within the movement. Sarah Palin defended the tea party, stating that claims of racism were false and appalling. Tea party activists described their movement as a diverse group of people advocating for lower taxes, limited government, and individual rights. The final wording of the resolution will be released after the approval of the NAACP's national board of directors in October. The debate highlights the ongoing tensions between the two groups and their differing views on race and political activism in America. END OF SUMMARY.
