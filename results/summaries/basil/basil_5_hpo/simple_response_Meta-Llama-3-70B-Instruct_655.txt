SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during their annual convention, calling on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within their ranks. The NAACP claims that the tea party has accepted and welcomed white supremacists into their organizations, and that this has led to a dangerous and divisive atmosphere. Tea party organizers and supporters, including Sarah Palin, have disputed these claims, saying that they are false and appalling. However, the NAACP points to instances of racism, such as the alleged use of racial epithets by tea party activists during the health care debate. The NAACP is urging the tea party to take responsibility and ensure that they do not tolerate bigotry or racism within their movement.
