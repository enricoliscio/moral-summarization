SUMMARY: 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks. The NAACP's resolution, adopted at its annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its movement. The resolution has sparked controversy, with tea party activists disputing the claims of racism and calling for the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The NAACP maintains that it has no problem with the tea party's existence but takes issue with its acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists and bigots. They believe that the tea party should be responsible for ensuring that bigotry and racism have no place in their movement. The tea party, on the other hand, describes itself as a diverse group of people advocating for limited government, lower taxes, individual rights, and political activism. They deny any evidence of racism and believe that the accusations are unfounded. The resolution has sparked a debate about the role of extremist groups and the need to focus on positive actions rather than divisive rhetoric.
