SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The NAACP's resolution, adopted during their annual convention, calls on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. Tea party organizers have disputed the claims, with Sarah Palin saying the accusations are "false and appalling." NAACP President Ben Jealous emphasized that the organization has no problem with the tea party's existence, but rather with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations. The resolution aims to empower the tea party to take responsibility and ensure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members. The debate has sparked a heated response, with some tea party activists calling on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. END OF SUMMARY.
