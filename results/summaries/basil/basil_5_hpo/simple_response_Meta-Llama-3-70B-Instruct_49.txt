SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has condemned racism within the tea party movement, accusing its activists of tolerating bigotry. The resolution, adopted at the NAACP's annual convention, calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its ranks. NAACP leaders argue that the movement has welcomed white supremacists and failed to address racism, which could lead to more dangerous consequences. Tea party organizers and supporters, including Sarah Palin, have disputed the claims, calling them "false" and "appalling." They argue that the movement is diverse and focused on issues like limited government and lower taxes, not racism. However, past incidents, such as racial epithets hurled at black congressmen, have raised concerns about racism within the movement. The NAACP's resolution aims to hold the tea party accountable for its actions and ensure that it does not tolerate bigotry.
