SUMMARY: During its annual convention in Kansas City, the NAACP accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks. The NAACP's resolution called on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within the movement, sparking debate and controversy. Tea party activists disputed the allegations, characterizing the movement as a diverse group advocating for limited government and lower taxes. They called on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution, arguing that there was no evidence of racism. The resolution's supporters, including NAACP President Ben Jealous, asserted that the tea party welcomed white supremacists into their organizations. The resolution also aimed to educate NAACP members and the community about the potential dangers of the tea party movement. Sarah Palin defended the tea party, calling the NAACP's claims false and appalling. The final wording of the resolution will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board of directors in October. 

END OF SUMMARY.
