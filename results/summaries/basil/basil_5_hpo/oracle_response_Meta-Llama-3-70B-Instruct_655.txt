SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization approved a resolution condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. NAACP leaders claim that the tea party's acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists is a major concern. Tea party organizers, on the other hand, dispute the allegations, calling them unfounded and false. They argue that the movement is made up of a diverse group of people upset with the country's direction, and that there is no evidence of racism within their ranks. The NAACP resolution aims to educate its membership and the community that the tea party's philosophy goes beyond just opposing higher taxes and limited government, and that it has the potential to become more dangerous if it tolerates bigotry. The organization is urging the tea party to stand up and take responsibility for ensuring that they do not tolerate racism and bigotry among their members.
