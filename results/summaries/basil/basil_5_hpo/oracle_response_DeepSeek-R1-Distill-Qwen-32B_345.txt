Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The NAACP is accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They passed a resolution condemning this, and the Tea Party is disputing the claims. The resolution calls for the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements. There's some debate about whether the Tea Party is welcoming white supremacists, and the NAACP wants them to be responsible members of democracy. The Tea Party activists are denying the accusations, saying they're unfounded and that people are running with these accusations as if they're true. There's also mention of past incidents where racists epithets were used, which the Tea Party denies.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: bigotry, racism, repudiate, racists, false, educate, become, stand, responsible, make, tolerate, acceptance, welcoming, going, unfounded, running, accusations, spit, pulling, looking, latching. 

I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, using "tolerating bigotry" and "condemning racism." Then mention the resolution and the call to repudiate. Include the NAACP's stance on not having a problem with the Tea Party's existence but their acceptance of supremacists. The Tea Party's response, using "unfounded" and "running with accusations." Also, note the past incident with the epithet and the NAACP's goal to educate and make the Tea Party responsible.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it in a few sentences, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate without making it sound forced. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward, focusing on the moral aspects as presented.
