SUMMARY: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization's leaders approved a resolution condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. The NAACP claims that the tea party has welcomed white supremacists into their organizations, which has led to a rise in bigotry and racism. Tea party activists, including Sarah Palin, have disputed the allegations, calling them "unfounded" and "appalling." However, the NAACP argues that the tea party's acceptance of bigotry is a threat to democracy and that it's time for the movement to take responsibility and stand against racism. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of tolerating bigotry and to empower the tea party to look inward and address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
