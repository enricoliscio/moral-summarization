SUMMARY: During its annual convention in Kansas City, the NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racism within the tea party movement. The resolution sparked debate, with some tea party activists disputing claims of racism and calling for the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The NAACP's resolution highlights concerns about the acceptance of white supremacists within the tea party movement and encourages the movement to repudiate any racist elements. Tea party supporters, including Sarah Palin, denied allegations of racism and expressed disappointment in the NAACP's claims. The resolution has sparked further discussion about the role of racism in political activism and the need for all groups to foster an inclusive and respectful environment. The final wording of the resolution will be released after the NAACP's national board of directors approves it in October. END OF SUMMARY.
