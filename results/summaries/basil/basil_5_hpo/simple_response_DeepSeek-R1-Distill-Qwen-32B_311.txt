Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it first.

The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They passed a resolution condemning this during their convention. Tea Party members denied the claims and called for the resolution to be withdrawn. There's some debate about whether the movement is inclusive or if it's welcoming racists.

I should start by identifying the main points: NAACP's accusation, the resolution's content, the Tea Party's response, and the context of past racism allegations. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”NAACP sees it as a responsibility to address racism, while the Tea Party feels unfairly accused.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to mention the resolution, the accusations, the Tea Party's denial, and the underlying issues like the 2010 health care protests. I should also highlight the NAACP's stance on the Tea Party needing to take responsibility.

Let me structure it: first, the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response, followed by the context and the moral implications. I'll avoid getting too bogged down in details, focusing on the key moral arguments from both sides.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused the Tea Party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution during its annual convention in Kansas City to condemn such behavior within the political movement. Tea Party activists denied the allegations, calling them unfounded and urging the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The NAACP resolution called on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities, emphasizing the need for the movement to take responsibility and ensure it does not welcome white supremacists. Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, criticized the NAACP's claims as false and appalling, arguing that the movement is made up of a diverse group of people concerned with government overreach. The resolution highlights concerns that the Tea Party could evolve into a more dangerous force, with a small percentage of members holding extremist views. The NAACP maintains it does not oppose the Tea Party's existence but condemns its acceptance of bigots. The debate reflects broader tensions over the Tea Party's inclusivity and its handling of accusations of racism, particularly following past incidents during the health care debate. END OF SUMMARY.
