Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I have to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP is accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They adopted a resolution to condemn this. The Tea Party disputes these claims, calling them false and unfounded. There's some debate about whether the movement is welcoming white supremacists. The NAACP wants the Tea Party to repudiate these elements and become responsible members of democracy. They also want to educate people about the potential dangers of the movement. The Tea Party activists argue that these accusations are running wild without evidence. The article also mentions past incidents where Tea Party supporters were accused of racism, like during the health care debate. The NAACP feels that focusing on the negative aspects makes it hard to create positive change, and they're concerned that extremist groups are latching onto these issues.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by mentioning the NAACP's accusation of the Tea Party tolerating bigotry and racism. Then, note the resolution they adopted. Include the Tea Party's response, calling the claims false and unfounded. Highlight the NAACP's desire for the Tea Party to repudiate racists and become responsible. Also, mention the NAACP's intent to educate the public. The Tea Party disputes these claims, saying they're based on unfounded accusations. Touch on the past incidents and the NAACP's concern about negative focus leading to extremism.

I should make sure to use the morally framed words provided, such as bigotry, racism, repudiate, racists, false, educate, become, responsible, tolerate, welcoming, unfounded, accusations, pulling, latching.

Let me structure the summary step by step:

1. NAACP accuses Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopts resolution.
2. Tea Party disputes claims, calling them false and unfounded.
3. NAACP wants Tea Party to repudiate racists and become responsible.
4. Resolution aims to educate about potential dangers.
5. Tea Party activists deny racism, say accusations are running without evidence.
6. Past incidents mentioned, NAACP concerned about negative focus attracting extremists.

Now, I'll write this in a concise manner, making sure to include all these points and the moral terms.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Let me draft it:

The NAACP has accused the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution to condemn these elements within the movement. The Tea Party disputes these claims, calling them false and unfounded. The NAACP resolution urges the Tea Party to repudiate racists and become responsible members of democracy. It also aims to educate the public about the potential dangers of the movement. Tea Party activists deny racism, stating the accusations are unfounded and running without evidence. Past incidents, like racial epithets during the health care debate, have fueled these accusations. The NAACP expresses concern that focusing on the negative aspects pulls attention away from positive change and allows extremist groups to latch onto the issue.

Now, I'll count the words to ensure it's under 200. It seems to be within the limit. I think this captures the moral framing effectively using the specified terms.
