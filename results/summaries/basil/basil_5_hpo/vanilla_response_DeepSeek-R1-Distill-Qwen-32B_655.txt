Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP and the Tea Party. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by mentioning that NAACP leaders accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and approved a resolution condemning racism. This happened at their annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to reject racist elements. Tea Party organizers are disputing these claims, saying they're false and asking the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.

I should note the key points: the NAACP's accusation, the resolution's content, the Tea Party's response, and the context of past claims of racism. Also, Sarah Palin's reaction and the NAACP's stance on not opposing the Tea Party's existence but their acceptance of white supremacists.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main action: NAACP condemns Tea Party for racism. Then mention the resolution's call to reject racists. Include the Tea Party's denial and request to withdraw the resolution. Add Sarah Palin's statement and the NAACP's position on not opposing the Tea Party itself but their welcoming of white supremacists. Also, include the context of past accusations during the health care debate.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering all main points without getting too detailed. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.
