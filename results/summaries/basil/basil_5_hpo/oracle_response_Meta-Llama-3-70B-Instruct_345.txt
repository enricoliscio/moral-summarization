SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during the NAACP's annual convention, calling on the tea party to "repudiate the racist element and activities" within their ranks. The NAACP claims that some tea party members have accepted and welcomed white supremacists, and that the movement has become a platform for bigotry. Tea party organizers have disputed these claims, calling them "unfounded" and "false." However, the NAACP points to incidents of racial epithets and spitting directed at black congressmen as evidence of the problem. The NAACP is urging the tea party to take responsibility and make a stand against racism, rather than tolerating or accepting it. By doing so, the NAACP hopes to empower the tea party to look inward and address the issue.
