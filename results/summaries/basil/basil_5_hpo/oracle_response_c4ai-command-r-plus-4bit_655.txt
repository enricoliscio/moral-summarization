SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks. The organization's leaders approved a resolution condemning racism within the tea party, sparking debate and responses from both sides. NAACP President Ben Jealous stated that they do not have a problem with the tea party's existence but take issue with their acceptance of white supremacists. Tea party activists disputed the allegations, claiming they are a diverse group with no evidence of racism. Sarah Palin, a prominent tea party supporter, called the claims false and appalling. The resolution aims to empower the tea party to address racism and encourage them to be responsible members of democracy. Anita Russell, president of the Kansas City NAACP branch, expressed concern about extremist groups latching onto negative messages. The final wording of the resolution will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board of directors.
