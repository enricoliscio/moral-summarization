SUMMARY: The NAACP accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and adopted a resolution condemning racism within the movement. The resolution was passed during the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City and sparked debate between the two groups. NAACP leaders claimed that the tea party welcomes white supremacists into their organizations, while tea party activists denied the allegations and called for the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, expressed sadness over the NAACP's claims and refuted accusations of racism within the movement. The final wording of the resolution will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board of directors in October. The debate highlights tensions between the two groups and their differing views on race and politics in America. END OF SUMMARY.
