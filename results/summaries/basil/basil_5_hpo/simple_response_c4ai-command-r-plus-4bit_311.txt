SUMMARY: Leaders of the NAACP accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks during their annual convention in Kansas City. The NAACP's resolution sparked debate and was criticized by tea party organizers and supporters, such as Sarah Palin, who denied claims of racism and called for the resolution to be withdrawn. The resolution highlighted the need for the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its movement and encouraged it to be more inclusive and tolerant. NAACP leaders, like Ben Jealous, expressed concern about the acceptance of white supremacists within tea party organizations. Tea party activists, on the other hand, denied allegations of racism and emphasized their commitment to limited government, individual rights, and political activism.
