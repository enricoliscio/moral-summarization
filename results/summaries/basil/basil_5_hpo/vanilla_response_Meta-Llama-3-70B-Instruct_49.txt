SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. During their annual convention in Kansas City, the NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racism within the tea party. The resolution calls on the tea party to "repudiate the racist element and activities" within their ranks. Tea party organizers have disputed the claims, with Sarah Palin calling the allegations "false and appalling." The NAACP president, Ben Jealous, stated that the organization is not opposed to the tea party's existence, but rather their acceptance of white supremacists. The resolution is set to be finalized in October. This is not the first time the tea party has faced allegations of racism, with similar claims made during the healthcare debate in March.
