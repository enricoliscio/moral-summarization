SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The NAACP's resolution, adopted during their annual convention, calls on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. The organization's leaders argue that the tea party's acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists is a problem that needs to be addressed. Tea party organizers, on the other hand, dispute claims of racism, calling them unfounded and appalling. They claim that their movement is made up of a diverse group of people who are upset with the current state of the country, and that they do not tolerate bigotry. The NAACP's resolution is seen as a call to action, urging the tea party to stand up against racism and bigotry, and to educate their members and the community about the dangers of tolerating hate groups.
