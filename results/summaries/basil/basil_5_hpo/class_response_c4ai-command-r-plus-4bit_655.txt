SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks, sparking a backlash from tea party activists who deny the allegations and call for the resolution to be withdrawn. The NAACP's resolution, which was adopted during its annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the tea party to repudiate racism and white supremacists among its members. NAACP leaders say they are not opposed to the tea party's existence but take issue with its acceptance of intolerance and hatred. Tea party activists, however, claim that the movement is diverse and united by a shared concern for the country's future. They argue that accusations of racism are unfounded and divisive. The NAACP's resolution has stirred debate about the nature of the tea party movement and the role of extremist elements within it. The NAACP stands by its resolution, asserting that it is necessary to expose and address racism and bigotry wherever they exist. End of summary.
