SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has condemned racism within the tea party movement, accusing its leaders of tolerating bigotry. The organization's resolution calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its ranks. Tea party organizers have disputed the claims, with Sarah Palin calling the accusations "false and appalling." However, NAACP leaders argue that the movement's acceptance of white supremacists is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. The resolution is a call to action for the tea party to take responsibility and ensure that bigots are not tolerated within their organizations. The NAACP's move is seen as a moral imperative, urging the tea party to reflect on its values and promote a more inclusive and respectful political discourse.
