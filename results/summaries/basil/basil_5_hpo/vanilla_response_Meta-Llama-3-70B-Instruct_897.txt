SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has adopted a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party movement. The resolution, approved during the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities within the movement. Tea Party organizers disputed the claims of racism, with Sarah Palin saying the allegations were "false and appalling." NAACP leaders argue that the Tea Party has tolerated bigotry and welcomed white supremacists into their organizations. The resolution is seen as a call to action for the Tea Party to take responsibility and ensure they don't tolerate racism. The debate has sparked a heated response, with some Tea Party groups calling on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The final wording of the resolution will be released in October after approval by the NAACP's national board of directors.
