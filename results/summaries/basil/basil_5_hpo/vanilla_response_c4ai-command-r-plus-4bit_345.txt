SUMMARY: The NAACP accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks during its annual convention in Kansas City. The organization's leaders debated and approved a resolution condemning the political movement, calling on it to repudiate any racist elements. Tea party activists disputed the claims of racism and called for the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. NAACP representatives stated that they had no issue with the tea party's existence but took umbrage with their acceptance of white supremacists. They encouraged the movement to ensure that bigotry and bigots are not tolerated among their members. The debate was largely closed to the public, and the final wording of the resolution will not be released until October when the NAACP's national board of directors approves it. Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, called the claims false and appalling, while tea party activists maintained that the movement is made up of diverse individuals united by a shared political philosophy. A separate group called the St. Louis Tea Party issued its own resolution asking the NAACP to withdraw its proposal.
END OF SUMMARY.
