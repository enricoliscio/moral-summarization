SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and approved a resolution condemning racism within the political movement. The resolution, adopted during the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the tea party to "repudiate the racist element and activities" within its ranks. Tea party organizers disputed the claims, saying they are unfounded and false. The NAACP president, Ben Jealous, stated that the organization doesn't have a problem with the tea party's existence, but rather with their acceptance of white supremacists into their organizations. The resolution comes after occasional claims of racism within the tea party movement, including an incident in March where black congressmen reported being subjected to racial epithets and spitting during a health care debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
