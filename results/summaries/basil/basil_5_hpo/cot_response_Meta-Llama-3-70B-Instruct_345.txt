SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. A resolution was adopted during the NAACP's annual convention, calling on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. The resolution condemned the acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into tea party organizations. Tea party organizers disputed the claims, calling them unfounded and appalling. The NAACP president emphasized that the organization has no problem with the tea party's existence, but rather with their tolerance of bigotry. The debate highlights the need for the tea party to be responsible members of democracy and ensure they don't tolerate racism or bigotry. END OF SUMMARY.
