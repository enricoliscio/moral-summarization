SUMMARY:

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their movement. The organization's leaders adopted a resolution condemning racism and calling on the tea party to repudiate the racist element and activities within their ranks. The resolution urges the tea party to be responsible members of democracy and ensure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members. Tea party organizers disputed the claims, calling them unfounded and false. However, the NAACP pointed to instances of racism, including racial epithets yelled at black congressmen and spitting incidents. The organization's president, Ben Jealous, emphasized that the issue is not with the tea party's existence, but with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of tolerating bigotry and racism.
