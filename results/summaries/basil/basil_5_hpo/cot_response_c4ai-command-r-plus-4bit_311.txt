SUMMARY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism. The NAACP's resolution, which was approved at their annual convention in Kansas City, calls on the tea party to repudiate racism and bigotry within its ranks. The resolution has sparked debate, with tea party activists disputing the claims of racism and calling for the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. The NAACP maintains that it has no issue with the tea party's existence but condemns its acceptance of white supremacists and bigotry. They believe that the tea party should be held responsible for ensuring that such elements are not tolerated within their movement. The resolution also highlights the need to educate people about the dangers of extremist groups latching onto and exploiting negative sentiments.

Palin, a prominent tea party supporter, and other tea party activists have denied the existence of racism within their movement, calling the accusations false and appalling. They assert that the movement is diverse and united by a shared concern for the country's future. However, the NAACP stands by its resolution, emphasizing the need to address and eradicate racism and bigotry in all forms.
