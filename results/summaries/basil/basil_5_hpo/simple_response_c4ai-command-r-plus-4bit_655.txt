SUMMARY: During their annual convention in Kansas City, civil rights organization NAACP accused tea party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism within their ranks. The NAACP's resolution highlights the need for the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its movement. While tea party supporters deny claims of racism and call for the resolution's withdrawal, the NAACP maintains that the issue lies in the tea party's acceptance of white supremacists. The debate has sparked controversy, with some accusing the NAACP of targeting patriotic Americans and falsely claiming that tea party activists judge people based on skin color. The resolution aims to encourage the tea party to take responsibility for ensuring that bigotry and bigots are not tolerated within their organizations. The NAACP emphasizes that it does not oppose the tea party's existence but seeks to address the concerning presence of extremist groups within the movement.
