Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. I should highlight the key points: the resolution passed, the Tea Party's response, the debate details, and the broader context of accusations against the Tea Party. I'll make sure to include the NAACP's stance and the Tea Party's denial, keeping it concise under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution at its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution condemns racist elements within the Tea Party movement and calls for its members to reject such activities. Tea Party organizers denied the allegations, calling them false and appalling, and demanded the NAACP withdraw the resolution. NAACP leaders emphasized their concern with the movement's acceptance of white supremacists, while Tea Party supporters, including Sarah Palin, rejected the claims as unfounded. The debate over the resolution highlighted tensions between the NAACP and the Tea Party, with the NAACP urging the movement to take responsibility and ensure it does not tolerate bigots. The resolution's final wording will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board in October. The controversy underscores ongoing accusations of racism against the Tea Party, particularly during the health care debate, though conservative activists deny these claims. The NAACP stressed the importance of addressing negative elements within the movement to promote a positive and inclusive democracy.
