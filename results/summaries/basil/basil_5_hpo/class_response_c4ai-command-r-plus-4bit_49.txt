SUMMARY: Leaders of the NAACP have accused the tea party movement of tolerating bigotry and racism within its ranks, sparking a debate over the moral integrity of the political movement. The NAACP's resolution, which was adopted during its annual convention, calls on the tea party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its ranks. NAACP leaders argue that the tea party welcomes white supremacists and fails to tolerate bigotry among its members. Tea party activists dispute these allegations, claiming that the movement is diverse and that accusations of racism are unfounded. The debate has brought attention to the moral responsibilities of political movements, with the NAACP urging the tea party to educate its members and stand against racism. The resolution has also prompted a backlash from some tea party supporters, who claim that the accusations are false and appalling. The final wording of the resolution will be released in October, but the debate highlights ongoing tensions between the two groups and their differing views on activism, tolerance, and racial equality.
