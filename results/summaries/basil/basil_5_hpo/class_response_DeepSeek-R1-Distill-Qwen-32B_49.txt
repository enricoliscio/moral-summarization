Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words they listed, like tolerating, bigotry, racism, etc. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They adopted a resolution at their convention. The Tea Party disputes these claims, saying they're unfounded and false. There are specific incidents mentioned, like the health care debate where some congressmen were spat on and called racial epithets. The NAACP wants the Tea Party to take responsibility, while the Tea Party activists argue they're a diverse group focused on less government and individual rights.

I should include the morally charged words like "tolerating," "bigotry," "racism," "saddened," "judge," "educate," "movement," "stand," "tolerate," "bigots," "welcoming," "unfounded," "accusations," "activism," "spit," "pulling," "looking," "latching." 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures both sides: NAACP's accusations and the Tea Party's defense. Also, mention the resolution and the response from Tea Party supporters like Sarah Palin and Alex Poulter. I should structure it to show the conflict and the moral stances each side is taking.

Let me start by stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response, include the incidents, and the broader context of the debate. Make sure to use the moral words to frame the summary accurately.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution at its annual convention in Kansas City. The resolution condemns the movement for welcoming white supremacists and calls on Tea Party members to repudiate racist elements. Tea Party organizers, including Sarah Palin, disputed these claims, calling them "unfounded" and "appalling." The NAACP aims to educate its membership about the potential dangers of the Tea Party movement, which they argue could evolve into a more harmful force. Tea Party activists, like Alex Poulter, maintain that the movement is diverse and focused on less government and individual rights, denying any evidence of racism. The debate highlights tensions between the NAACP's call for accountability and the Tea Party's defense against accusations of intolerance. END OF SUMMARY.
