Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and racism. They adopted a resolution condemning this, which the Tea Party disputes. The NAACP's resolution calls on the Tea Party to reject racist elements, and they want to educate people about the movement's dangers. The Tea Party activists, like Sarah Palin, are upset and deny the claims, calling them unfounded and appalling. There's also mention of past incidents where Tea Party supporters were accused of racism, like during the health care debate.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally charged words the author used: tolerating, bigotry, racism, racist, saddened, judge, educate, movement, stand, tolerate, bigots, welcoming, unfounded, accusations, activism, spit, pulling, looking, latching.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the NAACP and the Tea Party. Start with the accusation, the resolution, the Tea Party's response, and the context of past incidents. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft a summary that includes these elements, making sure to use the specified moral words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it captures the essence without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY: The NAACP accused Tea Party activists of tolerating bigotry and racism, adopting a resolution at its Kansas City convention to condemn such behavior. The resolution called on the Tea Party to reject racist elements and activities, while the NAACP also aimed to educate its members about the movement's potential dangers. Tea Party leaders disputed the claims, calling them unfounded and appalling, and demanded the resolution be withdrawn. Sarah Palin, a Tea Party supporter, expressed sadness over the accusations, denying that the movement judges people by skin color. NAACP President Ben Jealous emphasized the need for the Tea Party to take responsibility and not welcome white supremacists. Tea Party activist Alex Poulter argued the allegations were baseless, describing the movement as a diverse group concerned with government overreach. The debate followed past accusations of racism, including incidents during the health care debate where some Tea Party supporters were accused of using racial epithets and spitting at lawmakers. The NAACP resolution highlights concerns about the movement's tolerance of extremism, while Tea Party activists insist they are focused on limited government and individual rights. END OF SUMMARY.
