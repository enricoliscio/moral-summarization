SUMMARY: President Trump waded into dangerous waters by commenting on the criminal case of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump drew a comparison between Flynn's case and that of Hillary Clinton, claiming she "lied many times" to the FBI during her email investigation but faced no consequences. This tweet backfired, with legal experts suggesting it exposed Trump to obstruction of justice allegations as it implied prior knowledge of Flynn's lies. The President's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but the damage was done. Trump's comments, echoing a "double standard," and his denial of asking the FBI to go easy on Flynn, have raised concerns among some senators, who see a potential case of obstruction of justice building against the President. Trump's defense of Flynn and attack on Clinton's treatment by the FBI highlight a perceived injustice, but have also put him in a precarious legal and moral position.
END OF SUMMARY.
