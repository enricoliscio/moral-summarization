SUMMARY: President Trump has waded into moral controversy by commenting on the "very unfair" treatment of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump drew a moral comparison to Hillary Clinton, claiming she "lied many times" yet faced no consequences. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, stating that Flynn's actions during the transition were lawful and that he was merely "confused." However, Trump's comments have raised legal and moral concerns, with some experts suggesting potential obstruction of justice allegations. Senator Lindsey Graham warned Trump about the dangers of commenting on ongoing criminal investigations. Despite these warnings, Trump continues to defend Flynn, expressing sympathy for his plight and implying a double standard in the justice system. Flynn now cooperates with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling, leaving many wondering what revelations he might bring to light about Trump and his associates.
