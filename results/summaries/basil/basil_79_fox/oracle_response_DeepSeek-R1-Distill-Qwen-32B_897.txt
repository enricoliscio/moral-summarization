Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

President Trump is discussing the case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair." He compares Flynn's situation to Hillary Clinton's, noting that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump feels sorry for Flynn, who pleaded guilty. He mentions that Clinton lied many times but nothing happened to her, implying a double standard. The article also touches on Trump's tweets that got the White House into trouble, specifically about Flynn's firing and potential obstruction of justice. Senators Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein comment on the situation, with Feinstein suggesting an obstruction case is being built. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation.

I need to include the moral words: lied, destroyed, happened, ruined, unfair, lies, actions, obstruction, lying, putting. I should make sure these are present in the summary. Let me structure the summary to cover Trump's statements, the comparison with Clinton, the legal implications, and the political fallout.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's unfairness claim, then mention Flynn and Clinton's cases. Include the consequences faced by Flynn versus Clinton. Mention the tweets causing issues, potential obstruction charges, and Flynn's cooperation. End with the ongoing investigation and political implications.

I need to ensure the moral framing is clear, using the specified words. Let me draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all necessary points.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn as "very unfair," claiming Flynn and Hillary Clinton both "lied" to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts, stating that Flynn's life was "destroyed" while Clinton, who "lied many times," faced no repercussions. Trump accused the FBI of a "double standard," highlighting that Clinton's interview did not result in charges, unlike Flynn's case. This came after Trump's tweet about Flynn's firing sparked concerns of potential obstruction of justice, as it implied Trump knew Flynn had lied to the FBI. Trump denied asking Comey to stop investigating Flynn, while his lawyer John Dowd attempted to clarify the tweet. Senator Dianne Feinstein noted the Senate Judiciary Committee is "putting together" a case of obstruction against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, though his potential revelations remain unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
