SUMMARY: 
President Trump waded into moral controversy by commenting on the criminal case against former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Trump drew a moral equivalence between Flynn and Hillary Clinton, claiming both "lied" to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences, deeming it "very unfair." Trump's sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements about Russia contacts, contrasts with Clinton's lack of repercussions for her "lies" during an FBI interview. The president's remarks echo a weekend tweet suggesting a "double standard." Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, attributing Flynn's firing to his lies to the Vice President. However, Trump's comments have sparked concerns about obstruction of justice, with legal experts and Senator Dianne Feinstein noting the potential for a case to be built against the president. The situation is further complicated by Flynn's cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, raising questions about what he might reveal about Trump and his associates. END OF SUMMARY.
