SUMMARY: President Trump has called into question the fairness of the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, claiming that Flynn and Hillary Clinton both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced repercussions. Trump's comments come after Flynn pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. The President argued that Clinton "lied many times" during her FBI interview, yet faced no consequences, while Flynn's life has been "destroyed" and "ruined" due to his lies. Trump's tweet about the matter has caused controversy, with some legal experts suggesting it could expose the President to obstruction of justice allegations. His personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but the issue has sparked concerns about potential obstruction of justice by Trump. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is examining the possibility of obstruction of justice charges against the President. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, raising questions about what he might reveal about Trump and his associates. The contrasting outcomes for Flynn and Clinton, as portrayed by Trump, highlight what he perceives as an "unfair" justice system.
