SUMMARY: President Trump has waded into the criminal case against Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, calling it "very unfair." Trump drew comparisons between Flynn and Hillary Clinton, claiming both "lied" to the FBI yet faced disparate consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements about his Russia contacts, while Clinton faced no repercussions for her "many lies" during her FBI interview. Trump's comments echo a previous tweet that suggested a "double standard." The President's involvement has sparked concerns about potential obstruction of justice, with legal experts interpreting his tweet as an admission of prior knowledge of Flynn's lies. The White House has since attempted to clarify Trump's statements, but Senator Dianne Feinstein suggests an obstruction case is emerging. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling, the outcome of which remains uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
