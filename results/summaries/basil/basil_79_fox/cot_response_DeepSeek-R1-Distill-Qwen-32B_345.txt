Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about President Trump's comments on Michael Flynn's case. He says it's "unfair" that Flynn was prosecuted while Hillary Clinton wasn't. Words like "unfair," "lied," "ruined," "double standard," "careless," "peril," "shame," "lawful," "nothing to hide," "obstruction of justice," "deny," "accused," "cooperating," "truth," "justice," "fairness," and "transparency" stand out as morally charged.

Next, I have to summarize the article, keeping those moral terms. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I need to capture Trump's criticism of the Flynn case, his comparison to Clinton, the legal implications of his tweets, and the ongoing investigation. I should ensure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll include words like "unfair," "lied," "ruined," "double standard," etc.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: start with Trump's comments, mention the comparison to Clinton, touch on the legal issues from his tweets, and end with the implications for Flynn and the investigation. I need to make sure each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary is clear and accurate.

* Nothing to hide  
* Obstruction of justice

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair," and claimed a "double standard" existed between Flynn and Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying about his Russia contacts. Trump also highlighted that Clinton was not recorded or under oath during her FBI interview, unlike Flynn. However, legal experts warned that Trump's tweets about Flynn could expose him to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump denied asking FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating Flynn and claimed he fired Flynn only for lying to Vice President Pence. Meanwhile, Flynn is now cooperating with Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference, though it remains unclear what he might reveal. The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering whether Trump's actions constitute obstruction of justice, highlighting ongoing concerns about fairness and transparency in the case.
