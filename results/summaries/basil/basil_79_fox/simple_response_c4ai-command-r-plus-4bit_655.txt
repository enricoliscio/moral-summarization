SUMMARY: President Trump wades into dangerous moral territory, comparing the cases of Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton. Trump decries a "double standard" where Flynn's life is "ruined" for lying to the FBI while Clinton, who "lied many times," faced no consequences. This statement is morally dubious, as Clinton's case was handled by the FBI and Comey, who deemed her actions careless but not criminal. Trump's comments, including a tweet by his lawyer, potentially expose him to obstruction of justice allegations, as they indicate he knew Flynn lied to the FBI. The moral implications are serious, with Sen. Feinstein suggesting they form part of an obstruction case against Trump. Trump's defense of Flynn, who is now cooperating with Mueller, raises ethical concerns about his commitment to justice and equality before the law. Trump's actions and words are morally questionable and may have serious legal repercussions.
END OF SUMMARY.
