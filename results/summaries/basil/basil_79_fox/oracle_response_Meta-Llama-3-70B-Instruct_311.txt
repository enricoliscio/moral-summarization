SUMMARY:

President Trump sparked controversy by calling the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn "very unfair," claiming that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump feels "badly" for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts, and believes Clinton's actions were equally egregious. Trump's comments have raised concerns about obstruction of justice, as he previously tweeted that he fired Flynn for lying to the Vice President and the FBI, which could imply that he knew Flynn lied when he allegedly asked Comey to lay off the investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but the damage was done. The President's comments have sparked outrage, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein stating that the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators, and it remains to be seen what he will reveal about Trump and his associates.

END OF SUMMARY.
