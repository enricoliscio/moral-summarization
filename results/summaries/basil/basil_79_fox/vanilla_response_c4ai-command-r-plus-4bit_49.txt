SUMMARY: President Trump called the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn "very unfair," claiming Flynn and Hillary Clinton both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments come after Flynn pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump argued that Clinton "lied many times" during her FBI interview yet faced no repercussions, while Flynn's life was "ruined." This statement echoed a previous tweet by Trump suggesting a "double standard." The White House faced backlash after a tweet by Trump stating he had to fire Flynn for lying to the FBI, with legal experts suggesting it exposed Trump to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, claimed responsibility for the tweet, saying it referred to information given to the White House Counsel by then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Trump denied asking the FBI to stop investigating Flynn, but Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggested the Senate Judiciary Committee is seeing a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling.
END OF SUMMARY.
