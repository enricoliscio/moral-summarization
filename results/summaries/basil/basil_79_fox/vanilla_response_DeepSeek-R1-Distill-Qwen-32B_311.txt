Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump commenting on Michael Flynn's case. He called it "very unfair" because Flynn lied to the FBI and faced consequences, while Hillary Clinton lied too but didn't face the same fate. Trump mentioned this while leaving Washington for an event in Utah. 

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his Russia contacts. Trump feels bad for Flynn and points out the double standard, comparing it to Clinton's situation where she lied but nothing happened. The article also mentions that Trump's tweet about Flynn earlier caused issues, possibly implicating him in obstruction of justice. His lawyer, John Dowd, tried to clarify that the tweet wasn't breaking news and that Flynn's case was handled by the Justice Department. 

Senators like Lindsey Graham warned Trump about commenting on ongoing investigations. Feinstein suggested that the committee is seeing signs of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, but it's unclear what he'll reveal. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's comments, the comparison with Clinton, the consequences for Flynn, the tweet issue, the lawyer's clarification, senators' warnings, and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller. I'll structure it to cover all these points concisely.
