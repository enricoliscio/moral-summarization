SUMMARY:

President Trump sparked controversy by claiming that the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump argued that Flynn and Hillary Clinton both "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments were seen as an attempt to deflect attention from Flynn's guilty plea and to fuel a "double standard" narrative. However, Trump's words may have exposed him to further scrutiny, as some legal experts argued that his tweet potentially revealed obstruction of justice. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but the damage was already done. The incident has raised concerns about Trump's involvement in the Russia investigation and his potential interference with justice. As Senator Dianne Feinstein noted, the Senate Judiciary Committee is now seeing a case of obstruction of justice against Trump take shape.

END OF SUMMARY.
