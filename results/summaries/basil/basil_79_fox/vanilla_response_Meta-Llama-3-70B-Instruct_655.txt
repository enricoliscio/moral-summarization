SUMMARY:

President Trump has defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying the criminal case against him is "very unfair." Trump claimed that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump said Clinton "lied many times" during her FBI interview, but nothing happened to her, whereas Flynn's life was "ruined." Trump's comments have sparked controversy, with some legal experts saying his tweets could potentially expose him to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, later clarified that the tweet was referring to Flynn's conversation with Vice President Pence, not the FBI. Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said the Senate Judiciary Committee has begun to see "the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice" against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case.
