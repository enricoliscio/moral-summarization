Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments on Michael Flynn's case. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Trump called the case against Flynn "very unfair," comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. He mentioned that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. He felt bad for Flynn, who pleaded guilty. Trump pointed out that Clinton lied multiple times but nothing happened to her, implying a double standard.

Then, there's the context of Trump's previous tweet that caused issues. He said he fired Flynn because he lied, which some experts think could imply obstruction of justice. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, claimed he wrote the tweet and tried to clarify that the administration didn't accuse Flynn of lying. Trump also denied asking Comey to stop the investigation.

Additionally, Senator Lindsey Graham advised Trump to be cautious with his comments on ongoing investigations. Senator Feinstein mentioned that the Senate is looking into obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, but it's unclear what he'll reveal.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's unfairness claim, the comparison to Clinton, the tweet controversy, the legal implications, and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller. I'll make sure to mention the senators' comments on obstruction of justice and the potential risks of Trump's statements.

Let me structure it step by step: Start with Trump's unfairness statement, mention the comparison to Clinton, explain the tweet and its implications, include Dowd's clarification, then the senators' reactions, and end with Flynn's cooperation.

I should keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. Also, make sure to use clear and straightforward language without getting bogged down in too many details.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary, ensuring all key points are covered succinctly.
