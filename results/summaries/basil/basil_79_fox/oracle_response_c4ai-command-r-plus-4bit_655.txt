SUMMARY: President Trump waded into the case of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, claiming that Flynn's treatment was "very unfair". Trump drew a comparison between Flynn and Hillary Clinton, his 2016 Democratic rival, stating that both had "lied" to the FBI yet only Flynn faced consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life, he said, had been "destroyed" and "ruined" by the investigation. The president's comments came despite warnings from Senator Lindsey Graham, who cautioned Trump about commenting on ongoing criminal investigations. A tweet by Trump referring to Flynn's "lies" caused further problems, with legal experts suggesting it could expose the president to obstruction of justice allegations. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but Senator Dianne Feinstein asserted that a case of obstruction of justice was emerging against Trump. Flynn has pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI and is now cooperating with the Special Counsel's investigation into Russia's meddling. Trump's remarks highlight his perception of an unjust double standard in the treatment of Flynn and Clinton, with Flynn's life and reputation suffering as a result of his actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
