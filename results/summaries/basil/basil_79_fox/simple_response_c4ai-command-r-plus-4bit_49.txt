SUMMARY: President Trump waded into moral hazard territory on Monday, wading deeper into the Flynn investigation and claiming a 'double standard' in the treatment of his former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Trump stated that Clinton "lied many times to the FBI" during her interview regarding her private email server scandal, while Flynn's life was "destroyed" for doing the same. This echoes a controversial weekend tweet by Trump, which caused a stir as legal experts suggested it could expose Trump to obstruction of justice allegations. The President's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but Trump's comments on Monday reiterated his stance. Senator Lindsey Graham warned Trump about his tweets, while Senator Dianne Feinstein stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is observing a potential case of obstruction of justice. Flynn has pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI and is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Trump's comments highlight a perceived moral inequity in the treatment of Flynn and Clinton, with potential legal and political repercussions.
END OF SUMMARY.
