SUMMARY: President Trump commented on the criminal case against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, claiming that Flynn and Hillary Clinton both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump stated that Clinton lied multiple times during her FBI interview, while Flynn's life was "destroyed" for his false statements. Trump's comments echo a previous tweet, where he questioned a "double standard." Legal experts have suggested that Trump's comments could expose him to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, stating that Trump was referring to information provided to the White House Counsel by the former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggested that a case of obstruction of justice against Trump is forming. Flynn has pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI and is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
