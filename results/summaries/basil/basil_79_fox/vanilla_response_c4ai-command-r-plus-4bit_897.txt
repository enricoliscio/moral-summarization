SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the criminal case against his former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, claiming it is unfair compared to the treatment of Hillary Clinton. Trump asserted that both Flynn and Clinton lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements about his Russia contacts, while Clinton was not charged for her use of a private email server. Trump's comments come despite warnings from Senator Lindsey Graham, who advised caution when commenting on ongoing investigations. A recent tweet by Trump, claiming he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, has caused further issues, with legal experts suggesting it could expose Trump to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, has tried to clarify the tweet, but Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated that a case of obstruction of justice is emerging against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's election meddling.
END OF SUMMARY.
