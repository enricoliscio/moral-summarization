SUMMARY: President Trump waded into the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair." Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments come after he tweeted about Flynn's guilty plea, causing legal experts to raise questions about potential obstruction of justice by the president. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but the damage was done. Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggested that a case of obstruction of justice against Trump is emerging. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling, though the extent of his revelations is unknown. Trump's defense of Flynn and criticism of Clinton as "unfair" treatment highlight his views on lying to the FBI and the apparent double standard in consequences.
END OF SUMMARY.
