SUMMARY:
President Trump defended his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, claiming the criminal case against him is "very unfair". Trump argued that Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI, was treated harshly compared to Hillary Clinton, who "lied many times" to the FBI without facing consequences. Trump felt "badly" for Flynn, saying his life was "ruined" by the investigation. The president's comments sparked controversy, with some legal experts suggesting his tweets could expose him to "obstruction of justice" allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, saying it referred to Flynn's statements to the Vice President and FBI agents, which were deemed "lawful". The investigation into Flynn's Russia contacts continues, with Flynn now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators. END OF SUMMARY.
