SUMMARY: President Trump wades into the criminal case against his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, claiming that Flynn's treatment has been "very unfair." Trump compares Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, stating that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments come after Flynn pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. While Clinton was also interviewed by the FBI and was found to have acted carelessly, she did not face criminal charges. Trump's tweets and comments on the matter have raised concerns about possible obstruction of justice, as he allegedly knew Flynn had lied to the FBI when he asked the FBI to lay off the investigation. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to explain away the tweets, but Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggests that a case of obstruction of justice is emerging against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling, though the extent of his revelations about Trump and his associates is unclear. Trump's defense of Flynn and criticism of Clinton as the "liar" in this situation raises questions about the president's understanding of fairness and justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
