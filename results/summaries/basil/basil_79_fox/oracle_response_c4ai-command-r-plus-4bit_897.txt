SUMMARY: President Trump has waded into the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, claiming that Flynn's treatment has been "very unfair". Trump drew a comparison between Flynn and Hillary Clinton, stating that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts, while Clinton was not under oath or recorded during her FBI interview. Trump's comments have sparked concerns about obstruction of justice, with legal experts interpreting his weekend tweet as an admission that he knew Flynn had lied to the FBI when he allegedly asked Comey to halt the Flynn investigation. Despite this, Trump maintains that Flynn's actions during the transition were lawful and that he fired Flynn for lying to the Vice President. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, has attempted to clarify Trump's tweet, but Senator Dianne Feinstein suggests the President's comments are building a case of obstruction of justice. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, though the extent of his revelations about Trump and associates remains unclear. Trump's defense of Flynn and criticism of Clinton highlights his belief in an unjust double standard, yet his intervention may expose him to further legal scrutiny.
END OF SUMMARY.
