SUMMARY:

President Trump has called the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn "very unfair", claiming that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump feels "badly" for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump compared Flynn's situation to Clinton's, who was interviewed by the FBI about her private email system and was not charged. Trump also noted that Clinton was not recorded or under oath during her interview. Trump's comments have sparked controversy, with some legal experts saying his tweets could potentially expose him to obstruction of justice allegations. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case.

END OF SUMMARY.
