SUMMARY:

President Trump has sparked controversy by claiming that the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn is "very unfair". Trump argued that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments have been criticized for potentially exposing him to obstruction of justice allegations, as they suggest he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he allegedly asked Comey to lay off the investigation. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the situation, but the controversy has only deepened. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. The moral framing of this situation is clear: Trump's actions are being called into question, and his attempts to deflect criticism by invoking a perceived double standard are being seen as unjust and potentially illegal.

END OF SUMMARY.
