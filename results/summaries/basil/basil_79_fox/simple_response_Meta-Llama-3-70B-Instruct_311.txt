SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again demonstrated a blatant disregard for the rule of law and fairness by claiming that the criminal case against Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump's comments are a thinly veiled attempt to deflect attention from his own administration's wrongdoing and to discredit the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling. By falsely equating Flynn's guilty plea with Hillary Clinton's actions, Trump is engaging in a gross display of whataboutism and hypocrisy. The president's tweets and comments have already sparked concerns about obstruction of justice, and his continued interference in the investigation is a threat to the integrity of the legal process. It's clear that Trump is more concerned with protecting his own interests than with upholding justice and accountability. His actions are a stark reminder of the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
