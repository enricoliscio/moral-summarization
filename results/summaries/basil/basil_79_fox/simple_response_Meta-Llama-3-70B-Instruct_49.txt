SUMMARY:

President Trump has sparked controversy by claiming that the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump argued that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments have raised concerns about his potential involvement in the Russia investigation, with some legal experts suggesting that his tweets could be seen as obstruction of justice. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the situation, but the issue remains murky. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. The situation highlights the double standard that Trump claims exists, where Flynn is being punished for his lies while Clinton was not held accountable for hers. The moral framing of this situation suggests that the rule of law should be applied equally to all individuals, regardless of their political affiliations.
