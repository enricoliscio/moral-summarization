SUMMARY:
President Trump has sparked controversy by calling the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn "very unfair." Trump claimed that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. The president feels "badly" for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump argued that Clinton "lied many times" during her FBI interview, but "nothing happened to her." In contrast, Flynn's life was "ruined" after he lied. Trump's comments have raised concerns about obstruction of justice, with some legal experts suggesting that his tweet potentially exposed him to allegations. Trump has denied asking Comey to stop investigating Flynn, but the controversy continues to unfold. END OF SUMMARY.
