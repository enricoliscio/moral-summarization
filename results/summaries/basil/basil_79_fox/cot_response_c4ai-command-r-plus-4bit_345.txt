SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the criminal case against former national security advisor Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair." Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements about his Russia contacts, while Clinton faced no repercussions for her actions. The president's comments have sparked concerns about possible obstruction of justice, as they suggest he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he asked Comey to halt the investigation. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, arguing that Flynn was confused and that the FBI was not accusing him of lying. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein suggested that a case of obstruction of justice is emerging against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling, raising questions about what he might reveal about Trump and his associates. END OF SUMMARY.
