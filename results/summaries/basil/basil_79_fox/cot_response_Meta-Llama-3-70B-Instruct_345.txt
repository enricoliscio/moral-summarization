SUMMARY:
President Trump claimed the criminal case against Michael Flynn is "very unfair" and that Flynn's life was "ruined" because he lied to the FBI, whereas Hillary Clinton "lied many times" and faced no consequences. Trump's comments sparked controversy, with some legal experts suggesting his tweets could be seen as obstruction of justice. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the situation, but Senator Dianne Feinstein stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Meanwhile, Flynn is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case. Trump's comments have raised questions about a "double standard" and whether he is trying to influence the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
