SUMMARY: President Trump wades into the moral debate over the Flynn investigation, comparing it to Hillary Clinton's case and suggesting a double standard. Trump claims Clinton "lied many times to the FBI" without consequences, while Flynn's life was "destroyed" for lying. Legal experts raise concerns about potential obstruction of justice by Trump, as his tweet suggests prior knowledge of Flynn's lies. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, attempts to clarify the tweet, but Trump denies asking Comey to halt the Flynn probe. Sen. Dianne Feinstein sees a potential obstruction of justice case building against Trump. The moral framing of "unfairness" and "double standards" in the justice system is evident in Trump's comments, with Flynn's guilty plea and Clinton's lack of charges as the focal points. 

END OF SUMMARY.
