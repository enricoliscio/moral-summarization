SUMMARY:

President Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, claiming the criminal case against him is "very unfair." Trump argued that Flynn "lied" to the FBI, just like Hillary Clinton, but only Flynn faced consequences. The president feels "badly" for Flynn, saying his life was "ruined" by the FBI, while Clinton's "lies" went unpunished. Trump's comments have sparked controversy, with some legal experts suggesting his tweets could expose him to "obstruction of justice" allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, saying it referred to Flynn's conversation with the vice president, not the FBI. Despite this, Senator Dianne Feinstein believes the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of "obstruction of justice" against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators, potentially revealing more about Trump and his associates. Trump's actions have raised questions about a "double standard" and the fairness of the justice system.

END OF SUMMARY.
