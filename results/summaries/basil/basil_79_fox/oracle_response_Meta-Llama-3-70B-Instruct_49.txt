SUMMARY:

President Trump has sparked controversy by claiming that the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump alleges that Flynn "lied" to the FBI, just like Hillary Clinton, but only Flynn faced consequences. The president feels "badly" for Flynn, whose life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts. Trump argues that Clinton "lied many times" to the FBI without facing punishment, while Flynn's "lies" led to his downfall. The president's comments have raised concerns about obstruction of justice, with some legal experts suggesting that his tweets could be used as evidence against him. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, saying it was referring to Flynn's consistent story to the FBI and Vice President Pence. Despite the backlash, Trump continues to wade into the Flynn investigation, claiming a "double standard" is at play.
