SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, claiming it was unfair compared to the treatment of Hillary Clinton. Trump argued that both Flynn and Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. He also noted that Clinton was not under oath or recorded during her interview. Trump's comments, both in-person and on Twitter, have raised concerns about potential obstruction of justice allegations. His personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweets, saying they referred to information the White House had at the time. Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggested that there is a growing case for obstruction of justice against Trump, as Flynn cooperates with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
