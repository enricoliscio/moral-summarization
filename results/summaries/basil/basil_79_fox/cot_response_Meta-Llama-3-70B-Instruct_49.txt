SUMMARY:
President Trump has sparked controversy by calling the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn "very unfair." Trump claimed that both he and Hillary Clinton "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. The president feels "badly" for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump argued that Clinton "lied many times" during her FBI interview, but "nothing happened to her." In contrast, Flynn's life was "ruined" despite his actions being "lawful." Trump's comments have raised concerns about obstruction of justice, with some legal experts suggesting that his tweets could be used as evidence against him. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, has attempted to clarify the situation, but the controversy continues to swirl. END OF SUMMARY.
