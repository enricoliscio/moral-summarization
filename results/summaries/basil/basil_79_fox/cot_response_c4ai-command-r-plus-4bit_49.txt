SUMMARY: 
President Trump has criticized the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair." Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming that both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements about his Russia contacts, while Clinton faced no repercussions despite "lying many times" during her FBI interview. Trump's comments have sparked concerns about possible obstruction of justice, as his tweet revealed he knew Flynn had lied to the FBI when he asked Comey to drop the investigation. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the tweet, but Senator Dianne Feinstein suggested that the president's actions are building a case for obstruction of justice. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, raising questions about what he might reveal about Trump and his associates.
