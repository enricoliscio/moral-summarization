Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about President Trump commenting on Michael Flynn's case, comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. 

First, I should read through the article carefully. Trump is saying that both he and Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. He feels badly for Flynn, who pleaded guilty. He mentions that Clinton lied many times but nothing happened to her, while Flynn's life was ruined. He's suggesting a double standard.

The article also mentions that Trump's tweets about this caused issues, with legal experts concerned about obstruction of justice. Trump's lawyer tried to explain the tweet, but the Senate is looking into obstruction of justice. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, but it's unclear what he'll reveal.

I need to summarize this in under 200 words, focusing on Trump's moral argument about the double standard, the consequences for Flynn, and the political implications like the obstruction of justice allegations and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's comments, then the comparison to Clinton, the consequences for Flynn, the legal implications from Trump's tweets, and finally Flynn's role in Mueller's investigation.

I need to make sure I don't add any personal opinions, just present the facts as they are, preserving the moral framing from the article. So, I'll start with Trump's statement, then the comparison, the legal issues, and the ongoing investigation.

Let me draft this out, keeping it concise and within the word limit. Make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair," and compared it to Hillary Clinton's FBI interview, suggesting a double standard. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his Russia contacts, while Clinton faced no charges despite allegedly lying. Trump argued that Flynn's life was ruined, unlike Clinton. His comments and tweets on the matter have raised concerns about potential obstruction of justice, as legal experts noted his tweets could imply knowledge of Flynn's lies. Trump denied asking FBI Director Comey to halt the investigation. His lawyer, John Dowd, claimed the tweet was not meant to break news, citing confusion about Flynn's statements. Senate Democrats are considering obstruction of justice charges against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's Russia investigation, though his potential revelations remain unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
