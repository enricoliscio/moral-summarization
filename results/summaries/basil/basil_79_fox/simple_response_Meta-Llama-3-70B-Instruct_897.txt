SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again demonstrated a blatant disregard for the rule of law and fairness by claiming that the criminal case against Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump's comments are a thinly veiled attempt to deflect attention from his own administration's scandals by falsely equating Flynn's guilty plea with Hillary Clinton's actions during the email investigation. Trump's moral hypocrisy is on full display as he conveniently ignores the fact that Clinton was not charged with any crime, whereas Flynn has admitted to lying to the FBI. The president's tweets and comments have also raised concerns about obstruction of justice, with some legal experts arguing that his actions could be used as evidence against him. Trump's behavior is a stark reminder of the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions, and the need for a fair and impartial justice system that applies to all, regardless of political affiliation.

END OF SUMMARY.
