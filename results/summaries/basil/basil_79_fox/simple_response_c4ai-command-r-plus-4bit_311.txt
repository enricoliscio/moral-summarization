SUMMARY: President Trump wades into a moral debate about fairness and justice, comparing the treatment of Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton by the FBI. Trump claims Clinton "lied many times" yet faced no consequences, while Flynn's life was "destroyed" for lying. This raises questions about a potential double standard and the fairness of the justice system. Trump's comments, including a tweet written by his lawyer, have caused a stir, with some experts suggesting they expose him to obstruction of justice allegations. Senator Lindsey Graham warns Trump about the perils of commenting on ongoing investigations, while Senator Dianne Feinstein suggests a case of obstruction of justice is forming against the President. The moral framing of the article revolves around the concepts of fairness, justice, and equal treatment under the law, with Trump arguing for the unfair treatment of Flynn in comparison to Clinton.
