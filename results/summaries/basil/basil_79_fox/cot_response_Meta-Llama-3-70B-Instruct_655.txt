SUMMARY:
President Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, claiming the criminal case against him is "very unfair." Trump argued that Flynn and Hillary Clinton both "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump said he feels "badly" for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump claimed Clinton "lied many times" during her FBI interview, but nothing happened to her. In contrast, Flynn's life was "ruined." Trump's comments sparked controversy, with some legal experts suggesting his tweet potentially exposed him to "obstruction of justice" allegations. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of "obstruction of justice" against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case.
END OF SUMMARY.
