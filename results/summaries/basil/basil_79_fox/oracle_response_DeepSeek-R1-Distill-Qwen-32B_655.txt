Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible, like "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump commenting on Michael Flynn's case, comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. Trump feels it's unfair that Flynn faced consequences while Clinton didn't, even though both allegedly lied to the FBI. 

I need to make sure the summary includes the key moral terms. I should mention Trump's claims about both lying, the destruction of Flynn's life, and the unfairness. Also, include the context about the FBI investigation and the potential obstruction of justice allegations. 

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Trump's comments, compare Flynn and Clinton, mention the consequences, the unfairness, and touch on the obstruction angle. 

I'll also note that Flynn is cooperating with Mueller, which is a point in the article. Make sure to include that without adding extra info. 

Now, putting it all together, ensuring the moral words are included and the summary flows naturally.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair," as Flynn faced consequences for lying to the FBI while Hillary Clinton, who also allegedly lied, did not. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life was "destroyed" after pleading guilty to false statements about his Russia contacts. He contrasted Flynn's fate with Clinton's lack of repercussions, suggesting a "double standard." Trump's comments, including a problematic tweet, risked implicating him in obstruction of justice allegations, as he reportedly knew Flynn lied before firing him. Trump denied involvement in obstructing the investigation. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's probe, though it's unclear what he might reveal. END OF SUMMARY.
