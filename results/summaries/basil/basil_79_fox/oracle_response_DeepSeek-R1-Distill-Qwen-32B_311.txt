Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by understanding the article's content.

The article talks about President Trump commenting on Michael Flynn's case, comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. Trump claims both lied but only Flynn faced consequences, using words like "lied," "destroyed," and "unfair." I should include these words in the summary.

I need to capture the key points: Trump's comments, the comparison between Flynn and Clinton, the legal implications, and the political fallout. Also, mention the involvement of Mueller and the obstruction of justice allegations.

I should structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, making sure to use the specified moral terms. Let me outline the main points:

1. Trump calls Flynn's case "very unfair," noting both he and Clinton lied but only Flynn faced consequences.
2. Trump feels bad for Flynn, whose life was "destroyed" while Clinton faced nothing.
3. Flynn's guilty plea and comparison to Clinton's FBI interview without charges.
4. Trump's tweet causing issues, legal experts suggesting obstruction of justice.
5. Dowd's explanation and Trump's denial of asking Comey to stop the investigation.
6. Feinstein's comment about obstruction of justice and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller.

Now, I'll condense these points into a summary, ensuring the moral words are included and the summary stays under 200 words. I'll make sure each point is clear and flows logically.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair," as Flynn faced consequences for lying to the FBI while Hillary Clinton, who also lied during her FBI interview, did not. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life was "destroyed" by the case, while Clinton faced no repercussions. Flynn pleaded guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts, and Trump highlighted a "double standard." Trump's recent tweet about Flynn's lies and his firing sparked concerns of potential obstruction of justice, as it implied Trump knew Flynn lied. Trump denied asking former FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, claimed the tweet was not meant to break news, citing confusion over Flynn's statements. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein suggested the panel is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference, though his potential revelations remain unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
