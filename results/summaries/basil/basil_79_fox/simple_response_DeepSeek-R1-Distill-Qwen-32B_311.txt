Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article is about President Trump commenting on the criminal case against Michael Flynn. Trump claims that both he and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences, which he calls "very unfair." He mentions that Clinton lied multiple times but nothing happened to her, while Flynn's life was destroyed. 

I should note that Trump is drawing a comparison between Flynn and Clinton, suggesting a double standard. He's highlighting the unfairness of the situation, which is a moral argument about justice and equality in the legal system. 

The article also mentions the political implications. Trump's tweets have gotten the White House into hot water, with legal experts concerned about obstruction of justice. Senators like Lindsey Graham are advising Trump to be cautious with his comments. Additionally, Flynn is cooperating with Mueller's investigation, which adds another layer to the story.

I need to ensure the summary captures Trump's moral stance on the double standard and the political fallout from his comments. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to flow logically from Trump's statements to the consequences and implications.

Let me outline the main points:
1. Trump calls Flynn's case unfair, comparing it to Clinton's situation.
2. Flynn lied and faced consequences, while Clinton lied but didn't.
3. Trump's comments and tweets have caused legal concerns about obstruction of justice.
4. Senators warn Trump about his public statements on ongoing investigations.
5. Flynn is cooperating with Mueller, adding to the potential impact of Trump's comments.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include these points and maintain the moral framing about fairness and justice. I'll keep each sentence clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.
