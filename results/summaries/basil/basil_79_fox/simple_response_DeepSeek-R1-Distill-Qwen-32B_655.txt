Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments regarding Michael Flynn's case. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about Trump calling Flynn's case "very unfair," comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. He points out that both lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. This comparison seems to highlight a double standard, which is a moral point about fairness and justice.

I should note that Trump felt sorry for Flynn, who pleaded guilty. He contrasted that with Clinton, who lied but faced no charges. Comey didn't recommend charges against her, and she wasn't under oath. This adds to the moral argument that the treatment was unequal.

Then, Trump's tweet about Flynn led to potential obstruction of justice allegations. He fired Flynn for lying, but the tweet suggested he knew about the lies, which could implicate him. This is another moral issue, about whether Trump interfered with justice.

Senators Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein's comments add context. Graham warned Trump about commenting on investigations, while Feinstein suggested the committee is building an obstruction case. This shows the political and legal implications of Trump's actions, which is part of the moral framing.

Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller, but it's unclear what he'll reveal. This part is more about the ongoing investigation but ties back to the fairness issue Trump brought up.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's unfairness claim, then the comparison with Clinton, the consequences, Trump's tweet issues, the senators' reactions, and Flynn's cooperation.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that each moral point is succinctly presented without going into too much detail. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is included and the moral framing is preserved.
