Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific list of morally charged words to include. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

President Trump is criticizing the treatment of Michael Flynn, comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. He uses words like "lied" and "unfair," emphasizing a double standard. The article also mentions legal implications and the involvement of Robert Mueller. I should include terms like "destroyed," "ruined," "obstruction," and "putting together" as they highlight the moral aspects.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's comments, then compare Flynn and Clinton, touch on the legal issues, and conclude with the ongoing investigation. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure all the specified moral words are included without making it too lengthy.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each key point is covered concisely. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, I'll ensure the moral framing is clear by using the specified terms appropriately.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair" and comparing it to Hillary Clinton's treatment during her FBI interview. Trump argued that both Flynn and Clinton "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences, with his life being "destroyed" or "ruined." He emphasized a "double standard," suggesting Clinton's lies went unpunished. Trump's comments, including a controversial tweet, have raised concerns about potential "obstruction of justice" allegations, as they imply knowledge of Flynn's lies. Trump denied asking FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Meanwhile, Flynn is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference, though it's unclear what he might reveal. Sen. Dianne Feinstein noted the Senate Judiciary Committee is "putting together a case of obstruction of justice" against Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
