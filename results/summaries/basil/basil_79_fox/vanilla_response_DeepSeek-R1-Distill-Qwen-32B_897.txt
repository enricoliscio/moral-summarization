Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments on Michael Flynn's case. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Trump called the case against Flynn "very unfair." He compared Flynn's situation to Hillary Clinton's, saying both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. That's an important point because it shows Trump is highlighting a double standard.

Next, Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his Russia contacts. He pointed out that Clinton lied multiple times during her FBI interview but faced no charges, while Flynn's life was ruined. This comparison is central to Trump's argument about fairness.

The article also talks about Trump's tweet that caused issues for the White House. He mentioned firing Flynn because he lied, which some experts say could imply obstruction of justice. Trump later clarified that he fired Flynn for lying to Pence, not the FBI. His lawyer, John Dowd, claimed he wrote the tweet and didn't intend to break news, adding context about the FBI's confusion regarding Flynn's statements.

Additionally, there's mention of Senator Lindsey Graham advising Trump to be cautious with his comments on the Russia case. Senator Feinstein noted that the Senate is looking into obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, but it's unclear what he'll reveal.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on Trump's unfairness claim, the comparison to Clinton, the tweet controversy, and the implications for obstruction of justice. I should make sure to include the key points without getting bogged down in too much detail.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's unfairness statement, mention the comparison to Clinton, touch on the tweet and its implications, include Dowd's clarification, Graham's advice, Feinstein's comment, and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller. Keep it concise, ensuring each point is clear and flows logically.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary, making sure it's within the word limit and ends with the required tokens.
