SUMMARY:

President Trump has spoken out in defense of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, calling the criminal case against him "very unfair". Trump claimed that Flynn and Hillary Clinton both lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump felt "badly" for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Trump also tweeted over the weekend, sparking controversy and potentially exposing himself to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, later clarified the tweet, saying it referred to a conversation between acting Attorney General Sally Yates and White House Counsel Don McGahn. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee has begun to see a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case.

END OF SUMMARY.
