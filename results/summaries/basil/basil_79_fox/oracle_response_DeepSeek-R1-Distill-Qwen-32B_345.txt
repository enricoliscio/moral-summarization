Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. The article is about President Trump commenting on the case against Michael Flynn, comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is saying it's unfair that Flynn was prosecuted for lying to the FBI while Clinton lied and faced no consequences. He mentions that Flynn's life was destroyed, while Clinton's lies didn't result in anything. Trump's comments are part of a larger context where his tweets have caused legal issues, potentially implicating him in obstruction of justice. Senators are cautioning him about his comments, and Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation.

I need to make sure I include words like "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," "ruined," "lies," "actions," "obstruction," "lying," and "putting." I should structure the summary to highlight the moral comparisons Trump is making and the implications for his own legal situation.

I'll start by stating Trump's main point about the unfairness, mention Flynn's guilty plea, and the comparison to Clinton. Then, I'll note the legal implications from his tweets and the senators' warnings. Finally, I'll mention Flynn's cooperation with Mueller.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is to the point without unnecessary details. I'll also ensure that the moral framing is clear, using the specified words where appropriate.

Let me draft that. I'll make sure to include all the key points and the moral language without getting bogged down in too many specifics.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair," as Flynn faced consequences for lying to the FBI while Hillary Clinton, who also lied, did not. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life was "destroyed" after pleading guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts. He contrasted Flynn's fate with Clinton's, who faced no repercussions despite her "many lies" during her FBI interview. Trump accused the justice system of applying a "double standard," emphasizing that Flynn's lies led to his downfall, while Clinton's lies went unpunished. Trump's comments reignited concerns about potential obstruction of justice, as his tweets and statements risk implicating him in the Flynn investigation. Senators warned him against further involvement, while Flynn continues to cooperate with Mueller's probe, potentially revealing details about Trump and his associates. END OF SUMMARY.
