Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing that the author presented. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump commenting on the criminal case against Michael Flynn. Trump claims that both he and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences, calling it "very unfair." He mentions that Clinton lied multiple times but nothing happened to her, while Flynn's life was ruined. Trump is diving deeper into the Flynn investigation, even after his recent tweet caused issues for the White House.

The article also mentions that Trump's tweet exposed him to potential obstruction of justice allegations because it implied he knew Flynn lied and might have tried to stop the investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, tried to clarify that the tweet wasn't breaking news and that Flynn's situation was different because the department wasn't accusing him of lying. Senator Lindsey Graham advises Trump to be cautious with his tweets regarding ongoing investigations. Senator Feinstein suggests that the Senate is looking into obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, but it's unclear what he might reveal.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The moral framing here is Trump's criticism of the double standard, implying the justice system is unfair, and the potential legal implications for Trump himself.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's claims about the unfair treatment, the comparison with Clinton, the tweet causing legal issues, the clarification from Dowd, the senators' warnings, and Flynn's cooperation. I need to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is included without going over the word limit. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects, such as the unfairness and the double standard, as well as the legal implications for Trump.
