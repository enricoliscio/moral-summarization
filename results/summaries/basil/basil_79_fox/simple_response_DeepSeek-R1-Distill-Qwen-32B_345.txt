Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump commenting on Michael Flynn's case. Trump says it's unfair that Flynn faced consequences for lying to the FBI, while Hillary Clinton lied but faced nothing. He mentions the double standard and expresses sympathy for Flynn. There's also mention of legal implications from Trump's tweets, like potential obstruction of justice allegations. Senators Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein are mentioned, with Graham advising Trump to be cautious and Feinstein suggesting obstruction of justice is being built. Flynn is cooperating with Mueller, but it's unclear what he'll reveal.

I need to capture the moral arguments Trump is making, comparing Flynn and Clinton's treatment. Also, include the political implications and the potential legal issues from Trump's statements. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Trump's unfairness claim, compare Flynn and Clinton, mention the double standard, touch on the legal issues from his tweets, and note the political reactions and Flynn's cooperation.

Make sure to include that Trump feels bad for Flynn and the comparison to Clinton, as that's the moral angle. Also, mention the advice from Graham and Feinstein's comment on obstruction of justice. Keep it balanced and within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and includes all key points without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the criminal case against Michael Flynn, calling it "very unfair," and compared it to Hillary Clinton's treatment during her FBI interview. Trump argued that both he and Clinton lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences, suggesting a double standard. He expressed sympathy for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts. Trump's comments came after a tweet over the weekend raised concerns about obstruction of justice, as it implied he knew Flynn lied to the FBI before firing him. Trump denied asking former FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Senator Lindsey Graham advised Trump to be cautious with his public comments on ongoing investigations, while Senator Dianne Feinstein suggested the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, though it remains unclear what he might reveal about Trump and his associates. END OF SUMMARY.
