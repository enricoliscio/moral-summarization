Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump commenting on the criminal case against Michael Flynn. He calls it "very unfair," comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. Trump mentions that both lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. He feels bad for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements about his Russia contacts.

I should note the key points: Trump's comparison, the specifics of Flynn's case, Clinton's interview, and the political implications. Also, Trump's tweet caused issues, leading some to question obstruction of justice. Senator Lindsey Graham advises Trump to be cautious with his comments. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's statement, compare to Clinton, mention the consequences, the tweet controversy, Graham's advice, and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller. Keep it clear and to the point.

Make sure to include that Trump's tweet led to potential obstruction allegations and that Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller. Also, mention the political implications, like Feinstein's comment on obstruction of justice.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
