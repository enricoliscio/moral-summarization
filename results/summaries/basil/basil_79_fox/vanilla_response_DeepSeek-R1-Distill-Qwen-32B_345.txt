Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments on Michael Flynn's case. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump called the case against Flynn "very unfair." He compared Flynn to Hillary Clinton, saying both lied to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump felt badly for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his Russia contacts. He mentioned that Clinton lied multiple times but nothing happened to her, which he found unfair. This seems to be a recurring point for Trump, emphasizing a double standard.

Then, the article mentions that Trump's tweet about Flynn caused issues, potentially exposing him to obstruction of justice allegations. Legal experts pointed this out because Trump's tweet suggested he knew Flynn lied, which could tie into why he fired Comey. Trump had previously stated he fired Flynn only for lying to Pence, but his tweet complicated that narrative.

His lawyer, John Dowd, tried to clarify the tweet, saying it was about Sally Yates informing the White House that Flynn's story was consistent. Dowd claimed the tweet didn't mean to break news. However, some senators, like Lindsey Graham, advised Trump to be cautious with his comments on ongoing investigations.

Additionally, Senator Feinstein mentioned the Judiciary Committee seeing signs of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation, but it's unclear what he might reveal.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's unfairness claim, the comparison to Clinton, the tweet causing legal issues, Dowd's clarification, senators' advice, and Flynn's cooperation with Mueller.

I'll structure it by first stating Trump's unfairness comment, then the comparison to Clinton, the consequences of the tweet, Dowd's explanation, the senators' caution, and Flynn's role in Mueller's investigation. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
