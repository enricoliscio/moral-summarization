SUMMARY:

President Trump has expressed sympathy for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, calling the criminal case against him "very unfair." Trump claimed that both Flynn and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump tweeted over the weekend that Flynn's actions during the transition were lawful and that he had to fire him because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. However, this tweet has sparked concerns about potential obstruction of justice allegations, as it suggests Trump knew Flynn lied to agents when he allegedly asked FBI Director James Comey to lay off the investigation. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, later clarified that the tweet was referring to a conversation between Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and White House Counsel Don McGahn. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case.
