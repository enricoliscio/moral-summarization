SUMMARY:

President Trump has sparked controversy by claiming that the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump argued that Flynn "lied" to the FBI, while Hillary Clinton also "lied" during her FBI interview, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump said Clinton's "lies" went unpunished, while Flynn's "lies" "ruined his life." The president's comments have raised concerns about his involvement in the Flynn investigation, with some legal experts suggesting that his tweets could potentially expose him to "obstruction of justice" allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to clarify the president's tweet, saying it referred to Flynn's conversation with Vice President Pence, not his conversation with the FBI. Despite this, Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of "obstruction of justice" against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators, and it remains to be seen what he might reveal about Trump and his associates.

END OF SUMMARY.
