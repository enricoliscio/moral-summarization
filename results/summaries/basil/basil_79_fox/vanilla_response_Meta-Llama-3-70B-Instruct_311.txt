SUMMARY:

President Trump has sparked controversy by claiming that the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn is "very unfair." Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, stating that both "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. Trump's comments have raised concerns about obstruction of justice, as he previously tweeted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to lay off the investigation. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, later clarified that the tweet referred to a conversation between acting Attorney General Sally Yates and White House Counsel Don McGahn. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated that the Senate Judiciary Committee is building a case of obstruction of justice against Trump. Flynn is currently cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling.
