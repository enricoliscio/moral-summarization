SUMMARY: President Trump waded into the Michael Flynn investigation, claiming Flynn was treated unfairly compared to Hillary Clinton. Trump argued that Clinton "lied many times" to the FBI during her email investigation but faced no consequences, while Flynn's life was "ruined" for lying. Trump's tweet about knowing Flynn lied raised obstruction of justice concerns. His lawyer, John Dowd, clarified that Trump knew Flynn lied to Pence but not the FBI at the time of his firing. Trump's comments come as Flynn cooperates with the Special Counsel in the Russia investigation. Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Trump about commenting on ongoing investigations, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggested evidence of obstruction of justice is building.
END OF SUMMARY.
