SUMMARY:

President Trump sparked controversy by calling the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn "very unfair." Trump claimed that both he and Hillary Clinton "lied" to the FBI, but only Flynn faced consequences. The president's comments saw him wading deeper into the Flynn investigation, despite warnings from Senator Lindsey Graham to avoid commenting on ongoing criminal investigations. Trump's tweet over the weekend, which suggested Flynn's actions were lawful, potentially exposed him to obstruction of justice allegations. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, attempted to explain the tweet, but Senator Dianne Feinstein said the Senate Judiciary Committee has begun to see "the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice" against Trump. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI, is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators in the Russia meddling case. Trump's comments have been criticized for perpetuating a "double standard" and for potentially ruining Flynn's life.

END OF SUMMARY.
