Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using those words as much as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Michael Grimm facing fraud charges. He's a former FBI agent and Marine, known for a straight-arrow image. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started with his fundraising and expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. There were issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage. He's denying the charges, calling it a vendetta. He's up for re-election and had a heated encounter with a reporter.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list: fraud, corruption, obstruction, lying, funneling, misused, vendetta, investigation, leaks, violations, file, serve, dedication, tenacity, service, carrying, paid, pay, evade, filed, dissolve, developed, hot-tempered, misbehavior, threat, stormed, threatened, throw, stood, said, break.

I should structure the summary to include these words. Start with Grimm being expected to be indicted on fraud charges. Mention the investigation by FBI and US attorney's office, focusing on his restaurant. Include the specific charges: mail fraud, wire fraud, obstruction. Note the lying under oath and the funneling of funds. Mention the vendetta claim and the ongoing investigation. Highlight the restaurant issues: not carrying workers' comp, paying less than minimum wage, evading scrutiny. Mention the dissolution of the company and the lawsuit. Conclude with his reputation for being hot-tempered and the threat incident.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to face federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, stemming from a corruption investigation into his health food restaurant, Healthalicious. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and Brooklyn’s U.S. attorney’s office, began with an examination of his 2010 campaign fundraising and expanded to focus on alleged lying under oath and funneling illegal funds. Grimm has denied the charges, claiming the investigation is a politically driven vendetta. His restaurant, Granny Sayz, L.L.C., faced accusations of not carrying workers’ compensation insurance and paying employees less than minimum wage, with Grimm later dissolving the company. A federal lawsuit was filed against the restaurant after former employees complained. Grimm, known for being hot-tempered, recently threatened a reporter during an interview, adding to his reputation for congressional misbehavior. The investigation continues, with no charges yet filed related to campaign finance or misuse of office. Grimm maintains his dedication to public service while facing re-election. END OF SUMMARY.
