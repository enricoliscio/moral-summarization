Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Representative Grimm is facing federal fraud charges, including mail and wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started with his fundraising and expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. There were issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage, and he dissolved the company. He also had a heated interaction with a reporter, threatening him. His lawyer claims it's a politically motivated vendetta.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the indictment, the charges, and the focus on his restaurant. I'll include the fraud, corruption, obstruction, lying, funneling, and misused office aspects. Also, note the investigation's findings about the restaurant's issues and the threats to the reporter. Finally, mention Grimm's lawyer's defense and the ongoing investigation.

I should make sure to use the morally framed words like fraud, corruption, obstruction, lying, funneling, misused, vendetta, investigation, leaks, violations, file, serve, dedication, tenacity, service, carrying, paid, pay, evade, filed, dissolve, developed, hot-tempered, misbehavior, threat, stormed, threatened, throw, stood, said, break.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring all key points are covered concisely and the moral terms are included. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it natural, as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a corruption investigation. The charges reportedly focus on his conduct related to his health food restaurant, Healthalicious, which he owned after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006. Allegations include lying under oath in a federal lawsuit and funneling illegal campaign contributions. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, but no campaign finance charges or misuse of office are expected in the indictment. Grimm’s lawyer claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta and insists on his innocence. The investigation began over two years ago and has involved leaks and violations of grand jury secrecy. Grimm, known for being hot-tempered, recently threatened a reporter during an interview, adding to his reputation for misbehavior. The restaurant, Healthalicious, faced issues with workers’ compensation and minimum wage violations before Grimm dissolved the company. The investigation continues, and Grimm is up for re-election in November. END OF SUMMARY.
