SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice. The charges stem from Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006, and allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. Two of Grimm's fundraisers have already been charged with illegal campaign contributions and visa fraud, respectively. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." The congressman is known for his hot-tempered behavior and recently threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony during an interview. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, was first elected in 2010 and is up for re-election in November. He represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn.
END OF SUMMARY.
