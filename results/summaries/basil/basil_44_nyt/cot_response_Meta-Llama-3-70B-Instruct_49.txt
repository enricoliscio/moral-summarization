SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, allegedly stem from his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm, known for his straight-arrow image, is accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been marked by malicious leaks and strong-arm tactics, according to Grimm's lawyer. The congressman, who has a reputation for being hot-tempered, has denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." Grimm's behavior has been deemed bizarre, including a recent threat to a television reporter, where he said he would "break you in half. Like a boy." END OF SUMMARY.
