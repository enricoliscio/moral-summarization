SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006, as well as allegations of lying under oath. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has also resulted in charges against two of Grimm's fundraisers for illegal campaign contributions and visa fraud. While Grimm's lawyer calls the indictment a "politically driven vendetta," prosecutors assert that Grimm engaged in corruption and obstruction of justice. Grimm, known for his hot-tempered behavior, has also faced criticism for threatening a television reporter. The investigation into Grimm's campaign finances and potential misuse of office is ongoing. Grimm denies any wrongdoing and asserts his innocence.
