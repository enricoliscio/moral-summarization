SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation, conducted by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, one with illegally funneling money into his campaign and the other with visa fraud. The indictment is also expected to include charges of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered behavior and has previously threatened a television reporter, demonstrating a pattern of misbehavior. The investigation into Grimm's campaign finances and potential misuse of office is ongoing, and he faces re-election in November with a potentially formidable challenger. The restaurant in question, Healthalicious, was the subject of labor violations and wage complaints, leading Grimm to dissolve the company he formed to operate it.
END OF SUMMARY.
