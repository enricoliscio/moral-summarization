SUMMARY: 
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud. The investigation also revealed potential obstruction of justice by lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. While the charges do not currently include campaign finance accusations or misuse of office, the inquiry is ongoing. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta," marred by "malicious leaks" and "strong-arm tactics." The case centers around Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Separately, two of Grimm's fund-raisers have been chargedâ€”one for illegally funneling money into his campaign and the other for visa fraud. Grimm, known for his hot-tempered behavior, previously threatened a television reporter, demonstrating a pattern of misbehavior. Despite the allegations, Grimm asserts his innocence and intends to continue serving his constituents. The indictment and investigation cast a shadow over Grimm's re-election campaign, where he faces a strong challenger. The public nature of the case and its focus on potential corruption and fraud may impact Grimm's straight-arrow image.
END OF SUMMARY.
