SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm is also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. His lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm "asserts his innocence." However, the congressman's reputation has been marred by his hot-tempered behavior, including a bizarre threat to a television reporter. Despite the allegations, Grimm remains dedicated to serving his constituents and claims he will be vindicated. END OF SUMMARY.
