SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from a lengthy corruption investigation into his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit and engaged in fraudulent activities with the restaurant. The investigation, which began over two years ago, initially focused on Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 campaign, but it appears that the indictment will not include campaign finance charges. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. Grimm is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially strong challenger.

END OF SUMMARY.
