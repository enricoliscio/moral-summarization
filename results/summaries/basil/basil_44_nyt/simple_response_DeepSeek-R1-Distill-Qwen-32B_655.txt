Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about Grimm being expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges. He's a former FBI agent and Marine, which is part of his straight-arrow image. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The focus is on his health food restaurant after leaving the FBI. There's also mention of his fundraisers being charged, but no campaign finance charges against him yet. His lawyer claims it's a politically driven vendetta.

I should highlight the contrast between Grimm's image and the charges against him. The moral framing here is about someone who was seen as upstanding but is now facing serious allegations. Also, the mention of his temper and threatening a reporter adds to the negative portrayal.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start with Grimm's background, the charges, the focus on the restaurant, the fundraisers, the lack of misuse of office charges, his lawyer's defense, and the incident with the reporter. Make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with his expected indictment, his background, the nature of the charges, the investigation details, the fundraisers, the absence of campaign misuse charges, his lawyer's statement, and the on-air incident. That should cover the main moral aspects and the summary within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine known for his straight-arrow image, is expected to face federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a corruption investigation. The charges reportedly stem from his ownership of a health food restaurant in Manhattan and alleged misdeeds during his tenure. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, though no campaign finance violations or misuse of his congressional office are expected in the indictment. Grimm’s lawyer claims the investigation is politically motivated, describing it as a “vendetta.” Grimm, who is up for re-election, has maintained his innocence and continued to serve his constituents. However, his reputation for being hot-tempered was highlighted when he threatened a reporter during a televised interview, adding to the moral scrutiny surrounding his case.  
END OF SUMMARY.
