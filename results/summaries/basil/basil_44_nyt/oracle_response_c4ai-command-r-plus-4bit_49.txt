SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Two of his fund-raisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is known for his hot-tempered behavior and once threatened to throw a television reporter off a balcony. The investigation into Grimm's fund-raising for his 2010 race is ongoing.
END OF SUMMARY.
