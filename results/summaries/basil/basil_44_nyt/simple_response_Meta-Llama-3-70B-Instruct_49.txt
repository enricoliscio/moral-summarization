SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has focused on Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 congressional campaign and his business dealings. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged with illegal activities. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm will be vindicated. However, the congressman's reputation has been marred by allegations of fraud and a bizarre on-air threat to a TV reporter. Grimm's indictment raises questions about his integrity and fitness to serve in Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
