SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, allegedly stem from his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm is also accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has already led to charges against two of his fundraisers. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that his client asserts his innocence. However, the congressman's reputation has been marred by allegations of misusing his office and engaging in misbehavior, including a bizarre threat to a TV reporter. The indictment raises questions about Grimm's fitness to serve his constituents, who he claims to have served with dedication and tenacity.
