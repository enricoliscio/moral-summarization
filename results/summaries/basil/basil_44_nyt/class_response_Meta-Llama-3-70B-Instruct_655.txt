SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan, where he allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit and engaged in illegal activities, such as funneling over $10,000 into his campaign. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that his client asserts his innocence. However, the investigation has uncovered a pattern of misbehavior, including Grimm's hot-tempered outbursts, such as threatening a TV reporter, saying "I'll break you in half. Like a boy." The congressman's reputation is now marred by allegations of fraud, lying, and obstruction, and his constituents are left to wonder if he is truly serving their interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
