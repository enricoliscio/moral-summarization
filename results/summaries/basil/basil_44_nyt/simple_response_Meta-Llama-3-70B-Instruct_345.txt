SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, stem from his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. The investigation, which began over two years ago, initially focused on his fundraising for his 2010 congressional race but expanded to include allegations of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman will be vindicated. However, the allegations against Grimm, including underpaying workers and evading scrutiny, paint a picture of a politician who has betrayed the public's trust. His hot-tempered behavior, including a bizarre threat to a TV reporter, further erodes his credibility. The indictment raises questions about Grimm's fitness to serve in Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
