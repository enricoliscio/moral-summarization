Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Representative Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is facing federal fraud charges. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started with his fundraising and expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. There are issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage violations. His lawyer claims it's a politically motivated case. 

I should highlight the moral aspects, like the contrast between Grimm's straight-arrow image and the allegations. Also, note the lawyer's accusation of a vendetta and the ongoing investigation. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key details without getting too technical. I'll structure it to mention the charges, the restaurant issues, the investigation's origins, and the political angle. Make sure to end with Grimm asserting his innocence and continuing his service. Keep it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a two-year investigation into his conduct. The charges reportedly focus on his ownership of a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, which faced allegations of workers’ compensation violations and underpaying employees. Grimm, who asserts his innocence, claims the investigation is a politically motivated vendetta. His lawyer, William McGinley, stated that Grimm will continue to serve his constituents while awaiting resolution. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and Brooklyn’s U.S. attorney’s office, began with an examination of Grimm’s 2010 campaign fundraising, which already saw two associates charged with illegal activities. Despite the focus on his restaurant, no campaign finance charges are expected. Grimm, known for a hot temper, recently threatened a reporter during an interview. The case highlights the contrast between his straight-arrow image and the allegations of misconduct.
