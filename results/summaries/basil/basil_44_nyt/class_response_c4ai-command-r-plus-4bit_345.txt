SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, focused on Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006. Grimm is accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit and illegally funneling money into his campaign. However, the indictment does not include any campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office. Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta, plagued by malicious leaks and strong-arm tactics. The investigation began over two years ago and has resulted in charges against two of Grimm's fundraisers. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered behavior and once threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony during an on-air interview. Despite the charges, Grimm maintains his dedication to serving his constituents and continues to hold office. Grimm faces re-election in November and potential challenges from Democratic opponents. The investigation into Grimm's conduct and fundraising practices continues.
END OF SUMMARY.
