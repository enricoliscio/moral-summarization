SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office, began over two years ago and focused on Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006. Grimm's lawyer called the investigation a "politically driven vendetta," but prosecutors are expected to file criminal charges. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, has also been criticized for his hot-tempered behavior and threatening a television reporter. The investigation is continuing, and Grimm faces a potentially challenging re-election campaign in November. Grimm's fund-raisers have also been charged, with one pleading guilty to visa fraud charges. The charges against Grimm do not currently include campaign finance violations or misuse of office, but the congressman asserts his innocence and intends to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. 

END OF SUMMARY.
