SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. He is accused of illegally funneling funds into his campaign and misusing his office. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, one with visa fraud and the other with illegally funneling over $10,000 into his campaign. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that his client will be vindicated. However, the congressman's reputation for hot-tempered behavior and his threat to a TV reporter earlier this year raise questions about his innocence. Grimm will continue to serve his constituents despite the indictment.

END OF SUMMARY.
