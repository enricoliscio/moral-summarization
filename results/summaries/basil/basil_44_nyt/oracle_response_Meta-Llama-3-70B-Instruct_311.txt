SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan, where he allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been plagued by leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, according to Grimm's lawyer. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta." Despite the allegations, Grimm remains dedicated to serving his constituents, but his hot-tempered behavior has raised concerns, including a bizarre threat to a TV reporter. The indictment is expected to exclude campaign finance charges, but the investigation is ongoing. Grimm's reputation is at stake, and his innocence will be put to the test.

END OF SUMMARY.
