Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I have to make sure to include as many as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to get the main points.

The article is about Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, who's facing federal fraud charges. He's a former FBI agent and Marine, known for his straight-arrow image. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, related to his health food restaurant, Healthalicious, which he owned after leaving the FBI. The investigation started with his 2010 campaign fundraising and has expanded. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, one for illegally funneling money into his campaign, the other for visa fraud. However, the indictment doesn't seem to include campaign finance charges or misuse of his office, though the investigation is ongoing.

Grimm's lawyer claims the charges are politically motivated, calling it a vendetta. Grimm insists on his innocence and continues to serve his constituents. The article also mentions his reputation for being hot-tempered and an incident where he threatened a reporter during an interview.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words like indicted, fraud, investigation, obstruction, lying, illegally, funneling, misused, innocence, vendetta, leaks, violations, tactics, vindicated, serve, carrying, paid, pay, evade, misbehavior, threat, break.

I'll structure the summary to include Grimm's background, the charges, the focus on the restaurant, the fundraisers, the lawyer's statement, and the threat incident. I need to make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate without making the summary too long. Let me try to condense this into a coherent 200-word summary, ensuring all key points are covered with the necessary moral language.
