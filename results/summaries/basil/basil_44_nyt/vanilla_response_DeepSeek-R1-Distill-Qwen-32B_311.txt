Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Michael G. Grimm. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article mentions that Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. These charges relate to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006.

I should note that the investigation started over two years ago, looking into his 2010 campaign fundraising. Two of his fundraisers were already charged, one for funneling money illegally and another for visa fraud. However, the indictment doesn't seem to include campaign finance issues or misuse of office, though the investigation is ongoing.

Grimm's lawyer claims the charges are politically motivated and that Grimm is innocent. The restaurant, Healthalicious, had issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage. Grimm dissolved the company after complaints.

Also, Grimm has a reputation for being hot-tempered. There's an incident where he threatened a reporter after the State of the Union address.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the indictment, the charges, the restaurant issues, the investigation details, and Grimm's response. I should avoid including too much background or secondary details to keep it brief.

Let me structure it step by step: start with Grimm's expected indictment, list the charges, mention the restaurant and its issues, the investigation into fundraising, the status of the charges, and his lawyer's response. Then, add the part about his temperament and the reporter incident.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all main points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count after drafting to ensure it's under 200.
