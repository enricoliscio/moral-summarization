SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges are largely related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan, where he allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities and lied under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been plagued by leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, according to Grimm's lawyer. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta." Despite the charges, Grimm has maintained a reputation for being hot-tempered, and has even made threats to a television reporter. The congressman's behavior has been marked by misbehavior, and his actions have been characterized as a corruption of his office.
