SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath. The investigation, conducted by the FBI and the US attorney's office in Brooklyn, focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged with illegal campaign finance activities. Grimm's lawyer called the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserted Grimm's innocence, stating that Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The indictment is also expected to focus on Grimm's restaurant, Healthalicious, which was previously ordered to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers' compensation insurance and was accused of paying employees less than minimum wage and in cash to evade scrutiny. Grimm has also faced criticism for his hot-tempered behavior, including threatening a reporter during an on-air interview.
END OF SUMMARY.
