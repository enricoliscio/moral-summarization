SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges related to his health food restaurant, Healthalicious, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The charges, which include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, stem from a lengthy corruption investigation that began over two years ago. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit and misusing funds from his restaurant. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged in connection with the investigation. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman will be vindicated. Grimm is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially strong challenger.

END OF SUMMARY.
