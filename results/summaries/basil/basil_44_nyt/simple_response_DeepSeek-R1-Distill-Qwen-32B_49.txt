Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Grimm being expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. He's a Republican representing Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his 2010 campaign fundraising, which expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. Two of his fundraisers were already charged, one for funneling money illegally and another for visa fraud. The charges don't seem to include campaign finance misuse or office misconduct, but the investigation is ongoing.

Grimm's lawyer claims it's a politically motivated vendetta and that Grimm is innocent. Grimm has a reputation for being hot-tempered, and there's an incident where he threatened a reporter. The restaurant, Healthalicious, had issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage, leading to its dissolution.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like Grimm's straight-arrow image despite the charges, the fraud allegations, the ongoing investigation, and the personal conduct issues. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

I'll start by stating Grimm's expected indictment, his background, the charges, the focus on the restaurant, the fundraisers, the lawyer's response, and the personal conduct. I'll make sure to highlight the contrast between his image and the allegations, as well as the ongoing nature of the case.

Let me put that together concisely, ensuring all key points are included without going over the word limit.
