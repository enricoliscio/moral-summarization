Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Grimm is facing federal charges, including fraud and obstruction. The investigation started with his fundraising and expanded to his restaurant. He denies the charges, calling it a vendetta. There's also mention of his behavior towards a reporter.

I should include the key morally framed words: indicted, fraud, investigation, obstruction, lying, illegally, funneling, misused, innocence, vendetta, leaks, violations, tactics, vindicated, serve, carrying, paid, pay, evade, misbehavior, threat, break.

I need to structure the summary to cover Grimm's expected indictment, the charges, the investigation details, his response, and his behavior. I'll make sure each of these points uses the appropriate moral terms.

Let me start by mentioning the indictment and the charges. Then, explain the investigation's scope, including the restaurant and the people involved. Highlight his denial and the political angle. Finally, touch on his behavior towards the reporter.

I should keep each sentence concise and ensure the flow is logical. Also, make sure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, checking off each moral term as I include them.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a lengthy investigation into his conduct. The probe, led by the F.B.I. and Brooklyn’s U.S. attorney’s office, focused on his ownership of a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, and allegations of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. Two of his fundraisers were previously charged, with one accused of illegally funneling funds into his campaign. Grimm, who denies the charges, claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta and insists on his innocence. His lawyer accused the prosecution of leaks and violations of grand jury secrecy. The investigation did not initially include campaign finance charges or misuse of his office, though it remains ongoing. Grimm, known for a hot temper, recently threatened a reporter during an interview, adding to concerns about his behavior. He faces re-election in November amid these allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
