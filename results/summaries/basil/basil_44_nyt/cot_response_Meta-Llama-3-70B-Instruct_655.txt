SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, focus on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm is also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. His lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm "asserts his innocence." The congressman, known for his straight-arrow image, has developed a reputation for being hot-tempered, which was on display during a bizarre encounter with a television reporter. Despite the charges, Grimm's lawyer says he will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. END OF SUMMARY.
