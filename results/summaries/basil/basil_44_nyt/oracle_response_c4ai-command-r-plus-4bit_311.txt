SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath. The investigation into Grimm's conduct began over two years ago and focused largely on his business dealings after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006, including his ownership of a health food restaurant. Two of his fund-raisers have already been charged with campaign finance violations. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." Grimm is known for his hot-tempered behavior and has previously threatened a reporter, demonstrating a pattern of misbehavior. The investigation is ongoing, and Grimm maintains his innocence, asserting his dedication to public service. Grimm's lawyer plans to fight the charges, stating that Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with tenacity.
END OF SUMMARY.
