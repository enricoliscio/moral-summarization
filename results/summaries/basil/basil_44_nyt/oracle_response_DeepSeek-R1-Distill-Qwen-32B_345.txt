Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Grimm is facing federal fraud charges, including mail and wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started with his fundraising and expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. There were issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage. His lawyer claims it's a politically motivated vendetta. Also, Grimm had some heated interactions, like threatening a reporter.

I need to include words like fraud, corruption, obstruction, lying, funneling, misused, vendetta, investigation, leaks, violations, file, serve, dedication, tenacity, service, carrying, paid, pay, evade, filed, dissolve, developed, hot-tempered, misbehavior, threat, stormed, threatened, throw, stood, said, break.

I should structure the summary to cover Grimm's background, the charges, the restaurant issues, the investigation details, his lawyer's response, and his behavior. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate without forcing them in.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely and the moral terms are included. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to face federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a corruption investigation. The charges reportedly stem from his ownership of a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, where issues like unpaid workers’ compensation and underpayment of employees arose. Grimm’s lawyer claimed the investigation was a politically driven vendetta, emphasizing his client’s innocence. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and Brooklyn’s U.S. attorney’s office, began with Grimm’s 2010 campaign fundraising, which involved illegal funneling of funds, and expanded to his restaurant operations. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged. Grimm, known for his hot-tempered behavior, recently threatened a reporter during an interview, adding to his reputation for congressional misbehavior. The case highlights concerns about political leaks and violations of grand jury secrecy. Despite the allegations, Grimm continues to serve his constituents, asserting his dedication and tenacity in public service. END OF SUMMARY.
