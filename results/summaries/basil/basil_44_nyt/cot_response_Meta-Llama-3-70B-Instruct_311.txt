SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned, where he allegedly engaged in fraud and lied under oath. Grimm is also accused of obstruction of justice. His lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm will be vindicated. However, the congressman's reputation has been tainted by his hot-tempered behavior, including a bizarre threat to a television reporter. Grimm, who has a straight-arrow image, is up for re-election in November. END OF SUMMARY.
