SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges are largely focused on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm is also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been plagued by leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, according to Grimm's lawyer. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta." The congressman has a reputation for being hot-tempered, and was previously caught on camera threatening a TV reporter, saying he would "break you in half. Like a boy." The indictment does not include any campaign finance charges or accusations that Grimm misused his office.

END OF SUMMARY.
