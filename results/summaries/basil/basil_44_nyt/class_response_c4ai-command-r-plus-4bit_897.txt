SUMMARY: Former FBI agent and Marine Representative Michael G. Grimm is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, and obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath. The investigation, conducted by the FBI and the US attorney's office in Brooklyn, focused on Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm is also accused of illegally funneling money into his campaign and threatening a reporter during an on-air interview. Despite these allegations, Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta. The investigation has plagued Grimm's career, with two of his fundraisers already charged and questions raised about his campaign financing and potential misuse of office. The congressman, known for his hot-tempered reputation, now faces a challenging reelection campaign. Grimm's lawyer states that when the dust settles, his client will be vindicated, and until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity.
END OF SUMMARY.
