SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006, as well as allegations of lying under oath. This comes as a blow to Grimm, who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress. The investigation, conducted by the FBI and the US attorney's office, began over two years ago and also examined Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 race, leading to charges against two of his fundraisers. While the indictment does not appear to include campaign finance charges or misuse of office accusations, Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." Grimm, the only Republican in New York City's congressional delegation, faces re-election in November and a strong challenger. The restaurant at the center of the indictment, Healthalicious, was previously ordered to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers' compensation insurance and was also accused of violating minimum wage laws. Grimm's hot-tempered reputation was highlighted earlier this year when he threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony during an interview. END OF SUMMARY.
