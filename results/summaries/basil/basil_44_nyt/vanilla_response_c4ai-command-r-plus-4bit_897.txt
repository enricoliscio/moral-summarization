SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice. The charges focus on Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006, and his alleged lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. Two of Grimm's fundraisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include any campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." The investigation began over two years ago and has included an examination of Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 race. Grimm, the only Republican in New York City's congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially strong challenger. The restaurant Healthalicious, which Grimm operated through a company called Granny Sayz, LLC, was previously ordered to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers' compensation insurance and was also accused of paying employees less than minimum wage and in cash to evade scrutiny. Grimm is also known for his hot-tempered behavior, including a recent incident where he threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony.
END OF SUMMARY.
