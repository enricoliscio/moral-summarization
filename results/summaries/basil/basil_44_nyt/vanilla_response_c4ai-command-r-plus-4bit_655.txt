SUMMARY: U.S. Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice. The charges are largely focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation, which began over two years ago, also examined Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 campaign, resulting in charges against two of his fundraisers. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." The indictment is expected to focus on Grimm's restaurant, Healthalicious, which was previously accused of labor violations and not carrying workers' compensation insurance. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered behavior, including a recent threat against a television reporter. Grimm, the only Republican in New York City's congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a strong challenger.
