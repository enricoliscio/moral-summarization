SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges are expected to include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, and are related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. The investigation, which began over two years ago, initially focused on his fundraising for his 2010 campaign, but it appears that the indictment will not include campaign finance charges. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm will be vindicated. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially strong challenger. The indictment is expected to focus on his conduct at the restaurant, where he allegedly underpaid employees and evaded workers' compensation insurance.

END OF SUMMARY.
