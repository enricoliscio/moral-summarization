SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice. The charges are largely focused on Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include any campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office. Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and calls the investigation a politically driven vendetta. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered reputation and previously threatened a television reporter during an on-air incident.

END OF SUMMARY.
