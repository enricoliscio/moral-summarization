SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, and focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. The investigation began over two years ago, examining his fundraising for his 2010 race, and has expanded to include charges against two of his fundraisers. Despite his lawyer's claims of a "politically driven vendetta," the investigation has uncovered a pattern of deceit and abuse of power. Grimm's behavior has also been called into question, including a bizarre threat to a TV reporter, which raises concerns about his fitness for office. As a public servant, Grimm's actions are a betrayal of the trust placed in him, and his expected indictment is a reminder that those in power must be held accountable for their actions.
