Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael Grimm. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. I should focus on the key points and use the morally charged words from the article. 

First, the article talks about Grimm being expected to be indicted on fraud charges. So I'll mention the fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started with his fundraising and expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. I should include how he lied under oath and the restaurant's issues like not paying workers' comp and underpaying employees.

Also, his lawyer called it a politically driven vendetta, so I need to include that. I'll note that the charges don't involve campaign misuse but focus on the restaurant. His reputation for being hot-tempered and the incident with the reporter where he threatened to throw him off a balcony is important for the moral framing.

I should structure the summary to highlight the corruption, the specific frauds, his obstruction, lying, the restaurant's unethical practices, the vendetta claim, and his threatening behavior. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and using as many of the listed moral words as possible.

SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island and Brooklyn, is expected to face federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a corruption investigation. The charges reportedly stem from his ownership of a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, where he allegedly failed to pay workers’ compensation and underpaid employees. Grimm is also accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. His lawyer claimed the investigation was a politically driven vendetta. While the indictment does not include campaign finance charges, it focuses on alleged wrongdoing in his business dealings. Grimm, known for his hot-tempered reputation, recently threatened a reporter during an interview, adding to concerns about his conduct. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office, has been ongoing for over two years and has already charged two of his fundraisers. Grimm denies the allegations and continues to serve his constituents, maintaining his innocence. END OF SUMMARY.
