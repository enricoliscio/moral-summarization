SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, focused on Grimm's conduct regarding a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. He is accused of illegally funneling funds into his campaign and misusing his office. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, one with visa fraud and the other with illegally funneling over $10,000 into his campaign. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that his client will be vindicated. However, the congressman's reputation for being hot-tempered has been well-documented, including a bizarre threat to a television reporter. The indictment raises questions about Grimm's innocence and his ability to serve his constituents.

END OF SUMMARY.
