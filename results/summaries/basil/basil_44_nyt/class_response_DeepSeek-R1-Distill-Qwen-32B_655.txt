Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so the summary must include as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Representative Grimm is facing federal charges like mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his fundraising and restaurant business. He's denying the charges, calling it a politically driven vendetta. There are mentions of lying under oath, illegal funneling of funds, and evading scrutiny. The summary needs to include words like indicted, fraud, investigation, obstruction, lying, illegally, funneling, misused, innocence, vendetta, leaks, violations, tactics, vindicated, serve, carrying, paid, pay, evade, misbehavior, threat, break.

I should structure the summary to cover Grimm's background, the charges, the investigation details, his response, and the implications. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate without making the summary too long, keeping it under 200 words.

I need to ensure that the summary flows naturally while including all necessary elements. I'll start by stating the indictment, mention the charges, the focus on his restaurant, the fundraising issues, his denial, and the ongoing investigation. I'll also include the threats he made, which adds to the moral framing.

Finally, I'll check that all the specified words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a two-year investigation. The charges reportedly stem from his conduct involving a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006. He is accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit and allegedly evading scrutiny by paying workers less than minimum wage and in cash. Grimm has denied the charges, calling the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." His lawyer claims he will be vindicated and continues to serve his constituents. The investigation also involved illegal funneling of campaign funds, with two of his fundraisers already charged. However, no campaign finance charges against Grimm were expected. The probe into his alleged misbehavior and misuse of office continues. Grimm, known for his hot temper, recently threatened a reporter during an interview, adding to the moral and legal scrutiny surrounding his case. END OF SUMMARY.
