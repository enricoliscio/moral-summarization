Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

Rep. Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on fraud charges. The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his fundraising for the 2010 election. Two of his fundraisers were already charged. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath. 

Grimm's lawyer claims it's a politically driven vendetta and that Grimm is innocent. The article also mentions the restaurant Healthalicious, which he owned, and issues like not paying workers' compensation and underpaying employees. There's a part where Grimm threatened a reporter, showing he's hot-tempered and had misbehavior on camera.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like fraud, corruption, obstruction, lying, funneling, misused, vendetta, investigation, leaks, violations, file, serve, dedication, tenacity, service, carrying, paid, pay, evade, filed, dissolve, developed, hot-tempered, misbehavior, threat, stormed, threatened, throw, stood, said, break.

I should structure the summary to include these words, highlighting the corruption and fraud aspects, his obstruction, lying, the investigation, and his behavior. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral framing effectively.
