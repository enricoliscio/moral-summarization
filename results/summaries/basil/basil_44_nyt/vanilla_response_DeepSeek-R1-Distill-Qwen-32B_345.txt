Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main events. It mentions that Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice related to his restaurant after leaving the FBI. There's also mention of his fundraiser Diana Durand and Ofer Biton being charged, but the indictment doesn't include campaign finance issues. His lawyer claims it's a politically driven case. Grimm is up for re-election and has a reputation for being hot-tempered, even threatening a reporter.

I should structure the summary to include Grimm's background, the charges, the restaurant's issues, the fundraisers, the lack of campaign finance charges, his lawyer's response, and his behavior. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise and avoid extra details.

I'll start by stating the indictment, mention the charges, the restaurant's problems, the fundraisers, the lack of campaign issues, his lawyer's defense, and his recent behavior. Make sure to end with the summary token.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island and Brooklyn, is expected to face federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a corruption investigation. The charges reportedly stem from his ownership of a health food restaurant in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include campaign finance violations or misuse of his congressional office. Grimm’s lawyer claims the investigation is politically motivated. Grimm, known for a hot temper, recently threatened a reporter during an interview. The investigation, led by the FBI and Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office, has been ongoing for over two years. Grimm is up for re-election in November.
