SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan, where he allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit and engaged in fraudulent activities. The investigation, which began over two years ago, also looked into his fundraising for his 2010 race, but it appears that no campaign finance charges will be filed. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman will be vindicated. However, the evidence suggests a pattern of corruption and misbehavior, including allegations of funneling illegal campaign donations and mistreating employees at his restaurant. Grimm's hot-tempered behavior, including a bizarre threat to a TV reporter, has also raised concerns about his fitness for office.
