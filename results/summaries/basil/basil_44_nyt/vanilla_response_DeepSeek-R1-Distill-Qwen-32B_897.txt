Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. These charges relate to his ownership of a health food restaurant called Healthalicious, which he ran after leaving the FBI in 2006. There's also mention of him allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit.

The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his fundraising for the 2010 election. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged: Diana Durand for funneling illegal funds and Ofer Biton for visa fraud. However, the indictment doesn't seem to include campaign finance charges or misuse of his office, though the investigation is ongoing.

Grimm's lawyer claims the charges are politically motivated and that Grimm is innocent. The article also notes Grimm's reputation for being hot-tempered, including an incident where he threatened a reporter during an interview.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the main points: the indictment, the charges, the restaurant's issues, the fundraisers, the lawyer's statement, and Grimm's behavior. I should make sure to include the key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.
