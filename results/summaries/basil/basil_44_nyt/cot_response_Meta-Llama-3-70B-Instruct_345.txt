SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned, where he allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities and lied under oath in a federal lawsuit. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman will be vindicated. However, the investigation has already led to charges against two of his fund-raisers, and Grimm's own behavior has raised concerns, including a bizarre threat to a television reporter. Grimm's reputation for being hot-tempered has been well-documented, and his actions have been called into question. END OF SUMMARY.
