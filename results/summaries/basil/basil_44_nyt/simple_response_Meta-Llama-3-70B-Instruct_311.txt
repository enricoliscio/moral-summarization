SUMMARY:

Representative Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath. The charges stem from his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been marked by controversy, with Grimm's lawyer claiming it is a "politically driven vendetta." Despite the expected indictment, Grimm asserts his innocence and plans to continue serving his constituents. The case is a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and transparency in public office, and raises questions about the character of those who are elected to serve the people.

END OF SUMMARY.
