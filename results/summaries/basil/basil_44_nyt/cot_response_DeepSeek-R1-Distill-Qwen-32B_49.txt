Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York. He's facing federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his fundraising for the 2010 election. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged. The charges don't involve misuse of his office but focus on his restaurant business after leaving the FBI. There were issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage, leading to the restaurant's dissolution. Grimm's lawyer claims it's a politically motivated case, and Grimm insists on his innocence. Additionally, Grimm had a heated on-air incident with a reporter, threatening him.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral judgment or connotation. Let me go through the article again to pick them out.

- Indicted: implies wrongdoing.
- Fraud charges: morally wrong.
- Corruption investigation: implies unethical behavior.
- Obstruction of justice: morally wrong.
- Lying under oath: unethical.
- Malicious leaks: harmful intent.
- Strong-arm tactics: unethical methods.
- Vindicated: implies he's innocent, so it's a positive moral framing.
- Hot-tempered: negative trait.
- Bizarre threat: unethical behavior.
- Stormed off: aggressive, negative.
- Threatened: harmful action.
- Not man enough: disrespectful.
- Break you in half: violent threat.

So, these are the morally framed words. I'll list them as per the instructions.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral framing. I'll structure it to include the key points: the charges, the investigation, the restaurant issues, the lawyer's defense, and the on-air incident.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the moral terms without making it too lengthy. I'll start by mentioning Grimm's expected indictment, the charges, the focus on his restaurant, the fundraisers, the legal issues with the restaurant, the lawyer's response, and the altercation with the reporter.

I should ensure that each moral term is appropriately placed to maintain the original framing. For example, using "indicted," "fraud charges," "corruption investigation," etc., to highlight the negative aspects, while also including "vindicated" to show his defense.

I'll also mention the specific incidents like the workers' compensation issue and the threat to the reporter to provide context for the moral framing.

Finally, I'll conclude the summary by tying it all together, showing that despite the charges, the investigation continues and his reputation is at stake.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all the key morally framed words.
