SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI, as well as allegations of lying under oath. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has already resulted in charges against two of Grimm's fundraisers. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserts his innocence, claiming that Grimm will be vindicated. The congressman has also faced criticism for his hot-tempered behavior and bizarre threats made to a television reporter. The investigation is ongoing, but the indictment is not expected to include campaign finance charges or accusations of misuse of office. Grimm's restaurant, Healthalicious, was previously ordered to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers' compensation insurance, and was also accused of paying employees below minimum wage and in cash to evade scrutiny.
