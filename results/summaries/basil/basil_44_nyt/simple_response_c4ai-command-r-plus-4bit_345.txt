SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation, conducted by the FBI and the US attorney's office, focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include any campaign finance charges. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserts his client's innocence. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered reputation and previously threatened a television reporter during an on-air incident. This indictment raises questions about the integrity of a public servant who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
