SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation, conducted by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the F.B.I. in 2006. Grimm is accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit and illegally funneling money into his campaign. Despite denying any wrongdoing, claiming the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta," Grimm's lawyer confirmed the intention to file criminal charges. The investigation also revealed Grimm's reputation for being hot-tempered, including a threat made to a television reporter. The charges do not include campaign finance accusations or misuse of office, but the investigation is ongoing. Grimm, the only Republican in New York City's congressional delegation, faces re-election in November. His lawyer asserts Grimm's innocence and dedication to serving his constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
