Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article says Grimm is a former FBI agent and Marine, known for his straight-arrow image, but now he's facing federal fraud charges. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his 2010 campaign fundraising, which expanded to his restaurant, Healthalicious. Two of his fundraisers were already charged. 

Grimm's lawyer claims it's a politically driven vendetta and he's innocent. The restaurant had issues with workers' compensation and minimum wage. There's also a part where Grimm threatened a reporter, showing he's hot-tempered.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points but stays under 200 words. I should highlight the moral issues: Grimm's supposed integrity versus the fraud charges, the restaurant's labor violations, and his aggressive behavior. Also, note that no campaign finance misuse was found yet, but the investigation is ongoing. His lawyer's defense is important too.

Let me structure it: start with Grimm's background and the charges, mention the restaurant issues, the fundraisers, his behavior, and the lawyer's response. Keep it concise but cover all moral aspects.

Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine known for his law enforcement image, is expected to face federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a two-year investigation.
