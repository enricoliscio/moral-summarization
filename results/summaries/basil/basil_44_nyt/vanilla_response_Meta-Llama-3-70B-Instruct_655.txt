SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges are expected to include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. The investigation, which began over two years ago, focused on his fundraising for his 2010 race and expanded to include his business dealings. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The congressman, a former FBI agent and Marine, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially strong challenger. The indictment does not appear to include campaign finance charges or accusations of misuse of office.

END OF SUMMARY.
