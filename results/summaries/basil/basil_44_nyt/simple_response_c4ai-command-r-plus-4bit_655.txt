SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice. The charges stem from Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006, and allegations of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has also resulted in charges against two of Grimm's fundraisers, one for illegally funneling money into his campaign and the other for visa fraud. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta and asserts his client's innocence. The congressman, known for his hot-tempered behavior, previously made headlines for threatening a television reporter during an on-air interview. Grimm, the only Republican in New York City's congressional delegation, faces re-election in November with a potentially strong challenger. The restaurant at the center of the indictment, Healthalicious, was ordered to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers' compensation insurance and was also accused of violating labor laws. Grimm's company that operated the restaurant was affiliated with a company connected to one of the charged fundraisers.
END OF SUMMARY.
