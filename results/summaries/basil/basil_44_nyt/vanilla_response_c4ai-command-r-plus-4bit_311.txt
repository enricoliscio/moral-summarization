SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as obstruction of justice. The charges are largely focused on Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include any campaign finance charges. Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and claims the investigation is politically motivated. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered reputation and made headlines earlier this year for threatening a television reporter. The investigation into Grimm's fundraising practices began over two years ago and is ongoing.
END OF SUMMARY.
