SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan, where he allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit and engaged in fraudulent activities. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been plagued by leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, according to Grimm's lawyer. Grimm, who has developed a reputation for being hot-tempered, has denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a "politically driven vendetta." Despite the allegations, Grimm plans to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The indictment comes as Grimm faces a potentially formidable challenger in the November election.
