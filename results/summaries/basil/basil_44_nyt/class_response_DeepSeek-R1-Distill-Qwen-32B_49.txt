Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I need to make sure I incorporate as many of these words as possible without making the summary too long—no more than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Grimm is a former FBI agent and Marine who's facing federal charges, including fraud and obstruction of justice. The investigation started with his fundraising for the 2010 election and expanded to his restaurant business. He's denying the charges, claiming it's a political vendetta. There are mentions of his restaurant not carrying workers' compensation and underpaying employees. He also had some on-air misbehavior where he threatened a reporter.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list: indicted, fraud, investigation, obstruction, lying, illegally, funneling, misused, innocence, vendetta, leaks, violations, tactics, vindicated, serve, carrying, paid, pay, evade, misbehavior, threat, break.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the indictment, the charges related to fraud and obstruction, the investigation details, his defense, and the restaurant issues. I should also mention the threat to show his misbehavior.

I'll start by stating Grimm is expected to be indicted on fraud charges. Then mention the investigation into his restaurant and fundraising. Include the charges like mail fraud, wire fraud, obstruction for lying. Note that the charges don't involve campaign misuse but focus on the restaurant. Mention his lawyer's statement about it being a vendetta and his claim of innocence. Then talk about the restaurant's issues with workers' comp and underpayment, leading to its dissolution. Finally, mention the on-air threat as an example of misbehavior.

I need to make sure each sentence includes the moral terms without making it sound forced. I'll keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering the indictment, charges, investigation, defense, restaurant issues, and the threat. I'll make sure each morally framed word is naturally integrated.

SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, following a lengthy investigation into his conduct. The charges focus on his ownership of a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, and allegations of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, led by the F.B.I. and Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office, began with Grimm’s 2010 campaign fundraising and expanded to include his business dealings. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, but the indictment does not appear to include campaign finance violations or misuse of his congressional office. Grimm’s lawyer claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta and asserts Grimm’s innocence. The restaurant, which failed to carry workers’ compensation insurance and allegedly underpaid employees, was dissolved after complaints. Grimm has also been accused of misbehavior, including threatening a reporter during a televised interview. The investigation continues, with Grimm denying all allegations and vowing to serve his constituents until his name is cleared. END OF SUMMARY.
