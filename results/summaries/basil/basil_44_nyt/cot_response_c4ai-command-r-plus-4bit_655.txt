SUMMARY:
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges following a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges are believed to focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation, conducted by the FBI and the US attorney's office in Brooklyn, also examined Grimm's campaign fund-raising for his 2010 race, resulting in charges against two of his fund-raisers. While the indictment does not appear to include campaign finance charges or misuse of office accusations, the investigation is ongoing. Grimm's lawyer calls the charges a "politically driven vendetta," citing malicious leaks and strong-arm tactics. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is known for his straight-arrow image and hot-tempered behavior. He gained notoriety earlier this year for threatening a television reporter during an on-camera interview. Grimm denies any wrongdoing and asserts his innocence, vowing to continue serving his constituents. The investigation raises questions about Grimm's re-election prospects and the potential impact on the Republican Party's efforts to maintain control of the House of Representatives.
