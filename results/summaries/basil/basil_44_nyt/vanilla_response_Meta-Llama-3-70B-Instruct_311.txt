SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail and wire fraud, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges are related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm is also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation, which began over two years ago, initially focused on Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 race and has already led to charges against two of his fundraisers. Grimm's lawyer claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. Grimm, who is up for re-election in November, has been known for his hot temper, which was on display during a recent encounter with a TV reporter.
