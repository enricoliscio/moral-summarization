Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York, who's facing federal fraud charges. He's a former FBI agent and Marine, known for his straight-arrow image. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, related to his health food restaurant after leaving the FBI. He allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation started over his fundraising in 2010 and has expanded, with two of his fundraisers already charged. However, the indictment doesn't include campaign finance misuse or office misconduct. Grimm's lawyer claims it's a politically driven vendetta, and Grimm maintains his innocence. The article also mentions his reputation for being hot-tempered and a bizarre threat he made to a reporter.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The original text seems to present Grimm as someone who exploited his image but is now facing charges, which implies a moral downfall. The lawyer's statement about a political vendetta adds a layer of conflict, suggesting possible bias in the investigation.

I need to make sure the summary includes key points: Grimm's background, the charges, the focus on the restaurant, the investigation details, the absence of campaign finance charges, his lawyer's response, and his temperament. I should keep the tone that reflects the moral implications without adding personal opinions.

Let me structure this: Start with Grimm's background and the indictment expectation. Mention the charges related to the restaurant and obstruction. Note the investigation's scope and the two fundraisers charged. Highlight that no campaign misuse is alleged but the investigation continues. Include the lawyer's statement about a vendetta and Grimm's assertion of innocence. Conclude with his reputation and the threat incident to show his character.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but include all essential elements. Make sure to preserve the moral framing by showing Grimm's image contrasted with the charges and the possible political angle.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.
