SUMMARY: 
Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal corruption charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud. The charges also include obstruction of justice, for allegedly lying under oath. The investigation, conducted by the FBI and the US attorney's office, began over two years ago and focused on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, called the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and expressed confidence that Grimm would be vindicated. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is known for his dedication and tenacity in serving his constituents. However, he has also developed a reputation for misbehavior, including a bizarre threat made to a television reporter earlier this year. While the indictment does not currently include any campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office, the investigation is ongoing. Grimm faces re-election in November, with a potentially strong challenger from the Democratic Party.
