Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Michael G. Grimm. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says that Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges. The charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. These charges relate to his health food restaurant, Healthalicious, which he owned after leaving the FBI. The investigation started over two years ago, looking into his 2010 campaign fundraising. Two of his fundraisers have already been charged, one for funneling money illegally and another for visa fraud. However, the indictment doesn't seem to include campaign finance issues or misuse of his office, though the investigation is ongoing.

Grimm's lawyer claims the charges are politically motivated and that Grimm is innocent. The article also mentions that Grimm has a reputation for being hot-tempered and even made some controversial statements during an interview, threatening a reporter.

So, the key points are: Grimm's expected indictment on fraud charges related to his restaurant, the investigation into his fundraising, charges against his fundraisers, the lawyer's defense, and Grimm's behavior as a Congressman.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without going into too much detail. I should structure it to first mention the indictment, then the charges, the investigation details, the fundraisers, the lawyer's statement, and finally Grimm's reputation and behavior.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring it's concise and covers all main points.
