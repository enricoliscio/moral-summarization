SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation, led by the FBI and the US attorney's office, also examined Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 campaign, resulting in charges against two of his fundraisers. Grimm's lawyer called the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and expressed confidence in his client's vindication. The congressman, a former FBI agent and Marine, is known for his hot-tempered behavior, including a recent threat against a television reporter. The indictment is expected to be announced soon, though the investigation is ongoing. Grimm, the only Republican in New York City's congressional delegation, faces re-election in November against a potentially strong Democratic challenger.
