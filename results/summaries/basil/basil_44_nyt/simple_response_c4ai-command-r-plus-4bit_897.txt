SUMMARY: Former FBI agent and Marine Representative Michael G. Grimm is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also revealed illegal campaign contributions and visa fraud charges against two of Grimm's fundraisers. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserts his client's innocence. The indictment is expected to be announced soon, but it is unclear if it will include any campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office. Grimm, known for his hot-tempered behavior, previously threatened a television reporter during an on-air incident. This scandal raises serious ethical concerns about the conduct of a public official and calls into question Grimm's integrity and commitment to serving his constituents honestly and transparently.
END OF SUMMARY.
