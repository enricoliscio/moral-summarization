SUMMARY: Former FBI agent and US Marine Representative Michael G. Grimm is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The investigation revealed alleged misconduct in connection with a health food restaurant Grimm owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. He is also accused of lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. Two of Grimm's fundraisers have already been charged with illegal campaign finance activities, but the indictment does not currently include any campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserts his client's innocence. The investigation revealed potential violations and threats of misbehavior by Grimm, including a bizarre on-air threat to a television reporter. Grimm is up for re-election in November and faces a strong challenger. The restaurant in question, Healthalicious, was ordered to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers' compensation insurance and was accused of paying employees less than minimum wage and in cash to evade scrutiny. Grimm dissolved the company operating the restaurant and now faces potential legal consequences for his actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
