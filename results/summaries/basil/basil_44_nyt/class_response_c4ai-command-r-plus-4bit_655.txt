SUMMARY: Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from New York City, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation began over two years ago, examining Grimm's fundraising for his 2010 campaign, and has already resulted in charges against two of his fundraisers. While the indictment does not appear to include campaign finance charges or accusations of misusing his office, the investigation is ongoing. Grimm's lawyer calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta," and asserts his innocence. Grimm is known for his hot-tempered behavior and previously threatened a reporter, which caused controversy. The article details labor violations and lawsuits related to Grimm's restaurant and discusses the potential impact of the indictment on his re-election campaign. Grimm's lawyer states that Grimm will continue to serve his constituents.
