SUMMARY:

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former FBI agent and Marine, is expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation. The charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, focus on his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm allegedly lied under oath in a federal lawsuit and is accused of fraudulently funneling funds into his campaign. The investigation, which began over two years ago, has been plagued by leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, according to Grimm's lawyer. Grimm asserts his innocence and claims the investigation is a "politically driven vendetta." Despite the allegations, Grimm remains dedicated to serving his constituents and will continue to do so with tenacity. However, his reputation for being hot-tempered has been called into question, particularly after a bizarre threat he made to a television reporter. The indictment is expected to be filed soon, and Grimm's fate will be decided in the coming months.
