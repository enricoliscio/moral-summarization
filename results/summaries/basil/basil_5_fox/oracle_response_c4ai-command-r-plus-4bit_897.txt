SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, which was passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, also called on the Tea Party to reject homophobia and anti-Semitism. While the NAACP acknowledged the Tea Party's right to freedom of assembly, it criticized the movement's tolerance for bigoted statements and attempts to push the country back to the pre-civil rights era. NAACP leaders referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have denied these claims and challenged the existence of visual evidence. The St. Louis Tea Party accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and becoming a partisan attack dog organization. They also accused the NAACP of abandoning black America and focusing on political tactics. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party movement and its potential to fuel racism and destruction.
END OF SUMMARY.
