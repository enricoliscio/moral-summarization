Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words as per the instructions. Let me go through the article again.

The article starts with the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party. So "racist" is a moral term. They call on leaders to "repudiate bigotry," so "bigotry" is another. The resolution was amended to "downplay criticism" of all Tea Partiers, so "criticism" is framed negatively here. The NAACP President mentions "freedom of assembly" and "people raising their voices," which are positive moral concepts. He also talks about "bigoted statements" and "no place for racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia," all moral terms.

The article references an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used "racial epithets," which is a strong moral issue. Tea Party members challenge these claims, saying there's no "visual evidence," so "evidence" is framed in a moral context. Phillip Dennis says the movement "welcomes minority members" and accuses the NAACP of playing the "race card," another moral term. The St. Louis Tea Party condemns the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan," so those are moral words. They also mention "good will" and "repudiate racist element," which are positive and negative moral terms.

The NAACP's resolution is described as "bigoted, false, and inflammatory," so those are moral adjectives. The Tea Party is accused of "bigoted signs," and they "disavow" them, which is a moral action. The NAACP is said to have "abandoned black America" and "morphed into a political organization," implying a loss of moral purpose. They're accused of no longer prioritizing "civil rights," which is a key moral issue.

So, compiling all these, the morally framed words are: racist, bigotry, criticism, freedom, assembly, voices, democracy, bigoted statements, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, racial epithets, evidence, minority, race card, bigoted, partisan, good will, repudiate, bigoted, false, inflammatory, bigoted signs, disavow, abandoned, morphed, civil rights.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The NAACP condemns racist elements in the Tea Party, asking them to repudiate bigotry. They mention an incident with racial epithets but Tea Partiers deny it. The Tea Party responds by accusing the NAACP of being bigoted and irrelevant, and they drafted their own resolution. The NAACP emphasizes their commitment to civil rights and criticizes the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry. The debate highlights tensions over race and political influence.

I should structure this clearly, starting with the NAACP's action, the Tea Party's response, the incident reference, and the ongoing debate. Make sure to include the moral terms without making it too lengthy.
