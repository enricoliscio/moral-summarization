SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution was amended to focus on the movement's tolerance of bigotry rather than condemning all Tea Partiers. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes issue with the movement's acceptance of racist and bigoted statements, not the movement itself. Tea Party members have denied allegations of racism, with some accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack. The NAACP's resolution is a call to action, urging the Tea Party to take responsibility for its influence and reject racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. The moral imperative is clear: it is time for the Tea Party to stand against hate and promote inclusivity.
