SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, which was passed unanimously, also acknowledged the Tea Party's right to freedom of assembly but criticized their tolerance for bigoted statements and activities. NAACP leaders referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have disputed these claims and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card." The resolution called on the Tea Party to repudiate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry, and to educate its members about the dangers of a small percentage of people pushing for a return to the pre-civil rights era. In response, Tea Party organizers defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of abandoning civil rights and becoming a partisan attack dog organization. They also demanded that the NAACP withdraw its resolution, calling it "bigoted, false, and inflammatory." The final wording of the resolution will be released after approval by the NAACP's national board of directors in October.
END OF SUMMARY.
