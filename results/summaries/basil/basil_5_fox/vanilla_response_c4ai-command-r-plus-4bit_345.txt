SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution was passed at the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri, and called on the Tea Party to accept responsibility for influencing and ensuring that racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry have no place in their movement. The NAACP referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets against black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have disputed these claims and no visual evidence has been found. The resolution sparked backlash from Tea Party groups, who accused the NAACP of playing politics and abandoning its original mission. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." Tea Party organizers defended themselves against charges of racism and disavowed racially charged signs that appeared at their protests. The final wording of the NAACP resolution won't be released until it is approved by the organization's national board of directors in October.
END OF SUMMARY.
