SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, passed at the NAACP's annual convention, highlights the Tea Party's tolerance for bigoted statements and calls on the movement to accept responsibility for influencing its members to reject racism, antisemitism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination. NAACP leaders referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets against black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have denied these claims and challenged the existence of visual evidence. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party movement, which it believes could push the country back to the pre-civil rights era. In response, Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing politics and abandoning the true fight against segregation and oppression. They argue that the NAACP's resolution is bigoted and false, and have called for the organization to withdraw it.
END OF SUMMARY.
