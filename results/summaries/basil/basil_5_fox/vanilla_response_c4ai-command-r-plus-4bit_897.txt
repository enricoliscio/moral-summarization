SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution, passed at the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, MO, was amended to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers while asking them to reject bigotry in their ranks. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that the organization takes issue with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigotry and called on them to accept responsibility for influencing their movement. The resolution referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets towards black lawmakers, though Tea Party members have disputed these claims. Tea Party organizers defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing politics. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The final wording of the NAACP resolution won't be released until October, but it calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities within their movement.
END OF SUMMARY.
