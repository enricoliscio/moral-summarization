SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution, which was passed unanimously, stated that while the NAACP supports freedom of assembly, it takes issue with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigoted statements and activities within its ranks. NAACP leaders referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have disputed these claims and no visual evidence has been produced. The resolution called on the Tea Party to repudiate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry, and to accept responsibility for influencing their members to do the same. The NAACP's Hilary Shelton said the final wording of the resolution will not be released until it is approved by the national board of directors in October. In response, Tea Party groups have accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and becoming a partisan attack dog organization. They have defended themselves against charges of racism and criticized the NAACP for abandoning its original mission of fighting segregation and oppression. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted, false and inflammatory" statements.
END OF SUMMARY.
