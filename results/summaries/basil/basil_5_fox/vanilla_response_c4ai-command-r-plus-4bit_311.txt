SUMMARY: The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to reject bigotry. The resolution was passed at the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri, and amended to focus on repudiating bigotry within the Tea Party ranks rather than criticizing the movement as a whole. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that while they support the right to freedom of assembly, they take issue with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigotry. The resolution was in response to an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets towards black lawmakers, although Tea Party members have disputed these claims. The St. Louis Tea Party has responded by drafting their own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The final wording of the NAACP resolution won't be released until October, but it calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities within their movement. Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
