Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning the Tea Party movement for racism. They called on Tea Party leaders to reject bigoted elements. The NAACP said they don't have an issue with the movement itself but with the tolerance of bigotry. They mentioned an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs towards black lawmakers. However, Tea Party members denied these claims and accused the NAACP of playing the race card and being irrelevant. They even drafted their own resolution against the NAACP, calling them bigoted and partisan. The NAACP's resolution is still pending approval, and they aim to educate people about the movement's potential dangers. Tea Party organizers defend themselves, saying they stand for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and some argue that the NAACP is more harmful than helpful now.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words, focusing on the main points: NAACP's resolution, their stance, the incident, Tea Party's response, and the ongoing debate. I should ensure it's clear and concise, highlighting both sides' arguments without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to reject bigotry. While the NAACP supports freedom of assembly, it criticized the Tea Party for tolerating racism and other forms of intolerance. The resolution, initially strong in its language, was amended to focus on repudiating bigots within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the need for the Tea Party to address its influence responsibly. The resolution referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers in March, though Tea Party members denied these claims and accused the NAACP of political tactics. Tea Party leaders, such as Phillip Dennis, argued the movement is inclusive and accused the NAACP of being irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan." The NAACP's resolution, first reported by the Kansas City Star, aims to educate the public about the potential dangers of the Tea Party movement. The final version is pending approval by the NAACP's national board in October. Tea Party organizers continue to defend their movement, emphasizing smaller government and fiscal responsibility, while some critics argue the NAACP has strayed from its civil rights mission. END OF SUMMARY.
