Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the NAACP adopting a resolution against the Tea Party movement. They're condemning racist elements within the Tea Party and asking their leaders to repudiate bigotry. 

I should start by identifying the main points. The NAACP held their annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri, and passed this resolution. Initially, they were more critical, but they softened the language to avoid attacking all Tea Partiers. They still criticized the movement for tolerating bigotry.

Benjamin Todd Jealous, the NAACP president, made a statement about supporting free assembly but opposing bigotry. They referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs, but the Tea Party denies this, saying there's no visual evidence.

The Tea Party members, like Phillip Dennis, accused the NAACP of playing the race card and being irrelevant. They also drafted their own resolution against the NAACP, calling them bigoted and partisan. The NAACP's resolution will be finalized in October, and it's expected to mention the March incident.

Tea Party organizers defend themselves against racism charges, disavowing any racial signs. The NAACP's resolution was first reported by the Kansas City Star. Tea Party members like Bill Hennessy argue that their principles could help African-American communities, while Dana Loesch says the NAACP has become a political group neglecting civil rights.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the resolution, the NAACP's stance, the incident reference, the Tea Party's response, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to include key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with the resolution adoption, mention the initial and amended language, the NAACP's stance, the incident, Tea Party's denial, their counter-resolution, and the broader debate about the NAACP's role.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to cover both sides: NAACP's concerns and Tea Party's rebuttal. Also, note that the resolution's final version is pending approval.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and hits all the main points within the word limit.
