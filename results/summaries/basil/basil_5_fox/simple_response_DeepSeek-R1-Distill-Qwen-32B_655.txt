Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. They specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party movement. They're asking Tea Party leaders to repudiate bigotry. The Tea Party members are countering by saying it's a political ploy and denying any racism. There's mention of an incident where protesters allegedly used racial slurs, but no visual evidence was found. The NAACP's resolution was amended to avoid criticizing all Tea Partiers, focusing instead on bigots within their ranks.

I should highlight the moral stance of both sides. The NAACP is emphasizing the importance of rejecting racism, while the Tea Party is accusing the NAACP of being irrelevant and using the "race card." I need to capture the tension and the arguments from both perspectives without taking sides, just presenting the moral framing as given.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the NAACP's resolution, their reasoning, and then the Tea Party's response. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key points: the resolution, the incident reference, the amended wording, and the counterarguments from Tea Party members.

I should also note the St. Louis Tea Party's resolution against the NAACP and the accusations of the NAACP becoming partisan. Ending with the NAACP's stance on freedom of assembly and the call for responsibility wraps up the moral framing neatly.

Let me make sure I cover all these points succinctly, preserving the original moral perspectives without adding my own opinions. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to reject bigotry. While the resolution initially criticized the Tea Party, it was amended to focus on addressing bigots within the movement rather than condemning all Tea Partiers. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized support for freedom of assembly but criticized the movement's tolerance of racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution referenced a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs against black lawmakers, though Tea Party members denied the claims, calling them baseless and accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card." Tea Party leaders, including Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis, argued that their movement promotes smaller government and fiscal responsibility, not racism, and accused the NAACP of becoming irrelevant and partisan. The NAACP's resolution also faced criticism from the St. Louis Tea Party, which drafted its own resolution condemning the civil rights group for its "bigoted" and "partisan" stance. The NAACP maintains its commitment to addressing bigotry while supporting democratic principles. END OF SUMMARY.
