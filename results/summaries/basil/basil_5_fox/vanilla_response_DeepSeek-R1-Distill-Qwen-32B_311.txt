Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP and the Tea Party. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party. They want the Tea Party leaders to reject bigotry. The NAACP's resolution initially was stronger, but they amended it to not criticize all Tea Partiers, just the bigots within. Their president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, says they support free assembly but oppose bigotry. He mentions an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs towards black lawmakers in March. However, Tea Party members deny this, saying there's no visual evidence.

Phillip Dennis from Dallas says there's no proof of racism and that the Tea Party is open to minorities. He accuses the NAACP of using the race card and being irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted their own resolution against the NAACP, calling them bigoted and partisan. The NAACP's resolution also mentions educating members about the Tea Party's potential dangers. The Tea Party organizers defend themselves, disavowing any racism and pointing out that their movement is about smaller government and fiscal responsibility. They argue the NAACP has become a political tool and criticizes the NAACP's effectiveness in addressing black community issues.

So, the key points are:
- NAACP condemns Tea Party's racist elements.
- They amended their resolution to target bigots, not all Tea Partiers.
- Tea Party denies racism, claims NAACP is irrelevant.
- St. Louis Tea Party counters with their own resolution.
- Tea Party defends their values, accuses NAACP of being political.
- NAACP's resolution also warns about the Tea Party's potential dangers.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main actions and responses from both sides.
