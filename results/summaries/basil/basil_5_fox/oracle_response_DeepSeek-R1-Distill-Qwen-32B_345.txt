Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP is condemning the Tea Party for racism, and the Tea Party is pushing back, saying it's a political ploy. The resolution from the NAACP mentions racism, bigotry, antisemitism, and homophobia. They reference an incident where Tea Party members allegedly hurled racial epithets. The Tea Party denies these allegations and accuses the NAACP of being irrelevant and using the "race card."

I need to include the morally framed words like "condemned," "racist elements," "repudiate," "bigotry," "racism," "anti-Semitism," "homophobia," "attack," "tolerance," "statements," "dangerous," "taken," "crime," "poverty," "failure," "destruction," "segregation," "oppression," "harm."

I should structure the summary to highlight the NAACP's stance, the Tea Party's response, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to use the words from the list to maintain the author's framing.

Let me start by stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's reaction, and then the context of the March incident. I'll also include the charges of the Tea Party being a political ploy and the NAACP's call for responsibility. I'll end with the mutual accusations to show the tension.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence incorporates the necessary moral terms without making it too wordy.

SUMMARY: The NAACP recently adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution, passed at the organization's annual convention, accuses the Tea Party of tolerating bigoted statements and attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era." NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the group's support for freedom of assembly but criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of racism. The resolution references a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members deny these allegations, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and of being irrelevant. Some Tea Party leaders, like Dallas founder Phillip Dennis, claim the movement welcomes minorities and rejects racial discrimination. Meanwhile, the St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan" organization. The debate highlights ongoing tensions over the Tea Party's image and the NAACP's role in addressing racial issues in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
