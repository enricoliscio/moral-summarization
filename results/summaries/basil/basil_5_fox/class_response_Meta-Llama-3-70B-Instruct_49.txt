SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry and anti-Semitism. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, accuses the Tea Party of tolerating bigots and racist statements, citing an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's freedom of assembly, but rather with its tolerance for bigotry. Tea Party members, however, have denied allegations of racism, calling the NAACP's resolution a "bigoted" and "partisan attack." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution, accusing the NAACP of abandoning black America and morphing into a political organization that prioritizes politics over civil rights. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle against racism and oppression in the US.
