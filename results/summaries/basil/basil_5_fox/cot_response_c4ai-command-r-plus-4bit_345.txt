SUMMARY:
The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, highlights the organization's concerns about the Tea Party's "continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements." Despite accusations of playing the "race card," the NAACP maintains that it takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assemble and voice their opinions. Instead, it challenges the movement to take responsibility for denouncing racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within its ranks. The resolution comes in response to alleged incidents of racism directed at black lawmakers by Tea Party protesters, although Tea Party members have disputed these claims. Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of abandoning civil rights and resorting to political tactics. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the community about the potential dangers of the Tea Party movement, while Tea Party groups have responded by condemning the NAACP's resolution as "bigoted, false, and inflammatory."
