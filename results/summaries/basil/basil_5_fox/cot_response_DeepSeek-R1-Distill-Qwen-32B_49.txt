Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "condemning," "racist," "bigotry," "bigoted," "pre-civil rights era," "tolerance," "irrelevant," "bigoted," "partisan," "inflammatory," "failure," "bigotry," "oppression," and "malicious" come to mind. These words are used to convey judgments or criticisms, so they fit the moral framing.

Now, for the summary. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and includes those morally charged words. The article is about the NAACP condemning the Tea Party for racism, despite the Tea Party's claims it's a political move. The NAACP's resolution was amended to target bigots within the Tea Party, not all members. They referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets. The Tea Party denies this and accuses the NAACP of being irrelevant and bigoted. The St. Louis Tea Party even drafted their own resolution against the NAACP. The NAACP's resolution also links the Tea Party to dangerous ideologies. The Tea Party organizers defend themselves, saying they stand for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and accuse the NAACP of failing the African-American community.

I'll structure the summary to include all these points, making sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate. I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key actions and accusations from both sides. This way, the summary will accurately reflect the moral framing present in the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution initially accused the Tea Party of pushing the country back to the "pre-civil rights era," though it was amended to focus on bigots within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated the organization supports freedom of assembly but condemns the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry. The NAACP referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members denied the claims and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution, calling the NAACP a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The NAACP's resolution also warned of the movement's potential to become "more dangerous" for those who feel the country has been "taken away from them." Tea Party organizers denied racism, accusing the NAACP of failing black America and morphing into a political organization. The debate over the resolution highlighted ongoing tensions between the NAACP and the Tea Party over issues of race, bigotry, and political influence.
