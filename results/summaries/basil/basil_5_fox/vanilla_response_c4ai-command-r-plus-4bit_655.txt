SUMMARY: The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution was passed at the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri, despite pushback from Tea Party members who deny any racist behavior and accuse the NAACP of playing politics. The NAACP's resolution references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though no visual evidence has been produced. The NAACP maintains that the Tea Party tolerates bigotry and that it is the responsibility of its leaders to denounce such behavior. Tea Party organizers defend their movement, stating that they welcome minorities and stand for smaller government and fiscal responsibility. They accuse the NAACP of abandoning black America and becoming a partisan attack dog organization. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "inflammatory" statements. The NAACP's final wording will be released after approval from its national board of directors in October.
END OF SUMMARY.
