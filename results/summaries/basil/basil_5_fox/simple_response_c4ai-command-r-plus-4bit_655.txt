SUMMARY: The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. While the Tea Party movement advocates for freedom of assembly and speech, the NAACP asserts that it has tolerated bigoted statements and behaviors within its ranks. Incidents of racial epithets being hurled at black lawmakers and the presence of racially charged signs at protests have been cited as examples of racism within the movement. Tea Party members have denied and challenged these claims, accusing the NAACP of playing politics and abandoning its original mission of fighting segregation and oppression. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the community about the dangers of a small percentage of people within the Tea Party movement seeking to push the country back to the pre-civil rights era. The St. Louis Tea Party has responded by condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack, accusing them of resorting to political tactics and abandoning the African-American community. The debate highlights the tension between preserving civil rights and freedom of speech, with the NAACP calling for a repudiation of racism and the Tea Party defending its principles of limited government and fiscal responsibility.
