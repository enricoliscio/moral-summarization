Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning the Tea Party for racism and bigotry. They asked the Tea Party leaders to repudiate these elements. The Tea Party members denied these accusations, claiming it's a political ploy. There was an incident in March where racial epithets were allegedly used, but no visual evidence was found. The NAACP's resolution was amended to avoid criticizing all Tea Partiers, focusing instead on bigots within their ranks. Tea Party groups responded by accusing the NAACP of being partisan and irrelevant, even drafting their own resolution against the NAACP. The NAACP's stance is that the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry is problematic, and they need to take responsibility. The Tea Party argues that they stand for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and that the NAACP is failing the African-American community.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral terms provided. I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, their reasons, the Tea Party's response, and the underlying issues. I'll make sure to include words like racism, bigotry, repudiate, tolerance, attack, destruction, etc.

I should structure the summary to first mention the NAACP's resolution, then the Tea Party's denial and counter-resolution, and conclude with the broader implications and accusations. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and anti-Semitism, despite accusations that the measure was a political ploy. The resolution initially criticized the Tea Party for attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era," but was amended to focus on bigots within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized opposition to bigotry, not the Tea Party itself, while Tea Party members denied allegations of racism and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card." The NAACP referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though no visual evidence was produced. Tea Party groups, like the St. Louis Tea Party, drafted their own resolution condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan." The NAACP's resolution also criticized the Tea Party for potentially becoming "dangerous" for those who feel the country has been "taken away" from them. Tea Party organizers denied racism, disavowing racially charged signs at protests. The NAACP's stance was met with accusations of abandoning its civil rights mission, with some Tea Party members arguing their principles could help address crime, poverty, and destruction in the African-American community. END OF SUMMARY.
