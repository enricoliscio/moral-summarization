SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, asks the Tea Party to accept responsibility for influencing and making clear that there is no place for racism, antisemitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within their movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that while they support the freedom of assembly and people's right to raise their voices, they take issue with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigoted statements and actions. The resolution was in response to an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, and the NAACP believes that the movement is an attempt to push the country back to the pre-civil rights era. Tea Party members have denied and challenged these claims, accusing the NAACP of playing politics and becoming a partisan attack dog organization. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "malicious" actions. The debate has sparked a discussion about the role of these organizations in addressing racism and bigotry in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
