SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, urges the Tea Party to accept responsibility for tolerating racism and anti-Semitism within its ranks. NAACP leaders cited an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Tea Party members deny the allegations and accuse the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog" behavior. The NAACP resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party movement, which it believes could become more dangerous for minorities if left unchecked.
