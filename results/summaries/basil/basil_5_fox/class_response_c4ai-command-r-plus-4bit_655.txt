SUMMARY: The NAACP has taken a stand against what it perceives as racist elements within the Tea Party movement, adopting a resolution that condemns bigotry and racism. Despite accusations of playing political games, the NAACP maintains that it supports freedom of assembly and speech but expects the Tea Party to take responsibility and repudiate any racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic sentiments expressed by its members. The NAACP referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets towards black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have denied these claims and accused the NAACP of using the race card. The St. Louis Tea Party has fired back with its own resolution, condemning the NAACP for what it sees as a bigoted and partisan attack. The NAACP, however, maintains that it is simply educating its members about the dangers of the movement and the potential for it to push the country back to a pre-civil rights era.
END OF SUMMARY.
