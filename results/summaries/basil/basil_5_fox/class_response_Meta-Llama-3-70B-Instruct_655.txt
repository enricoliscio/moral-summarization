SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, criticizes the Tea Party's tolerance of racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assemble, but rather with its failure to condemn bigotry within its ranks. The resolution references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members have denied the allegations, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution, condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle against racism and bigotry in American politics.
