Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP is condemning the Tea Party for racism and bigotry, while the Tea Party denies these allegations and accuses the NAACP of being irrelevant. 

I should identify the key events: the resolution passed by the NAACP, the response from Tea Party members, and the specific moral terms used. I need to make sure to include words like "racism," "bigotry," "repudiate," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the two groups, their accusations, and the underlying issues they're addressing, like crime and poverty in the African-American community.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response, and touch on the broader implications they mention. I'll ensure that the moral language is preserved to reflect the author's framing. Let me put this together step by step, making sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution, initially stronger in its criticism, was amended to focus on addressing bigots within the Tea Party ranks rather than attacking the movement as a whole. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized support for freedom of assembly but criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry. The resolution referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members denied these claims, asserting no visual evidence exists. Tea Party leaders accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and becoming irrelevant, with some calling it a "bigoted" and "partisan" organization. The debate over the resolution highlighted broader tensions, with Tea Party organizers denying racism and accusing the NAACP of failing to address crime, poverty, and family breakdown in the African-American community. The NAACP, once a vital force against segregation and oppression, is now accused of prioritizing politics over civil rights, with some arguing its actions do more harm than good. END OF SUMMARY.
