SUMMARY:
The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, calls on the Tea Party to accept responsibility for its influence and reject racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assemble, but rather with its tolerance of bigotry. Tea Party members have responded defensively, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has even drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack. The debate highlights the deep divisions between the two groups on issues of race and politics. END OF SUMMARY.
