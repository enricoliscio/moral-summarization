SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, acknowledges the Tea Party's right to assemble and express themselves, but criticizes the movement's tolerance of bigotry and racist statements. NAACP leaders point to an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, although Tea Party members deny the allegations. Tea Party organizers have responded by accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant" and "bigoted." They argue that the NAACP has abandoned its civil rights mission and is now a partisan attack dog organization. The NAACP's resolution is seen as a call to action for the Tea Party to address its own racism and bigotry, and to promote a more inclusive and respectful movement.
