SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, asks the Tea Party to accept responsibility and denounce racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within its ranks. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that while they support the freedom of assembly and free speech, they take issue with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigoted statements and behavior. The resolution was in response to an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epitheets at black lawmakers, although Tea Party members have disputed these claims. Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing politics. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for reducing itself to a "bigoted" and partisan organization. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party movement and its potential impact on civil rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
