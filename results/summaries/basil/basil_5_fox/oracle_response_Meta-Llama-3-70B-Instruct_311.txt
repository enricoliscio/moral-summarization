SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement and urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution accuses the Tea Party of tolerating racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia, and attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era." NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assembly, but rather with its tolerance of bigotry. The resolution references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members have denied the allegations and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog" behavior. The debate highlights the tension between the two groups, with the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of dangerous and harmful rhetoric, and the Tea Party accusing the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission.
