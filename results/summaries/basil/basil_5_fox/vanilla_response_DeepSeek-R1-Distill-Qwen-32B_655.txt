Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP and the Tea Party. Let me read through the article first to understand what's happening.

The article starts by saying that the NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement. They called on Tea Party leaders to repudiate bigotry. The Tea Partiers, however, claim this is just a political ploy. The NAACP made this resolution at their annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri. Initially, the resolution was stronger, saying they would "repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties," but they amended it to not criticize all Tea Partiers, just the bigots within the movement.

Benjamin Todd Jealous, the NAACP president, said they support freedom of assembly and people's right to voice their opinions, but they take issue with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigotry. He mentioned an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill before a health care vote. However, Tea Party members have denied these allegations, saying there's no visual evidence of a racist attack.

Phillip Dennis, a Dallas Tea Party founder, said there's no proof of racist behavior and that the movement welcomes minorities. He accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and called them irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party responded by drafting their own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization."

The NAACP's resolution was debated, and the final version won't be released until October. It originally aimed to educate the public that the Tea Party isn't just about taxes and limited government but could become dangerous for a small percentage who think the country has been taken away from them. The St. Louis Tea Party quickly fired back, calling the resolution bigoted and false, and urged the IRS to reconsider the NAACP's tax-exempt status.

Tea Party organizers often deny racism, disavowing any racially charged signs in their protests. The NAACP's resolution was expected to reference the March incident. Some Tea Party members, like Bill Hennessy and Dana Loesch, criticized the NAACP for becoming a political organization, accusing them of no longer prioritizing civil rights and instead harming the African-American community.

So, putting this together, the summary should cover the NAACP's resolution, the Tea Party's response, the incident in March, the amended resolution, the mutual accusations, and the broader debate about the NAACP's role.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all key points without getting too detailed. I should also ensure it's in the correct format with the SUMMARY: and END OF SUMMARY. tokens.
