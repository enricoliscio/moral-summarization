Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement. They're asking Tea Party leaders to reject bigotry. The Tea Party members are denying these accusations and claim it's just a political move by the NAACP.

The NAACP's resolution was amended to not criticize all Tea Partiers but to focus on the bigots within their ranks. They mentioned an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs, but there's no visual evidence. Tea Party leaders like Phillip Dennis deny the racism and accuse the NAACP of playing the "race card."

There's also a response from the St. Louis Tea Party, which drafted their own resolution calling the NAACP "bigoted" and "partisan." They're also urging the IRS to reconsider the NAACP's tax-exempt status. Tea Party organizers are defending themselves against racism charges, disavowing any racially charged signs at their protests.

The NAACP's resolution was expected to reference the March incident, and some Tea Party members like Bill Hennessy and Dana Loesch are criticizing the NAACP for becoming political and abandoning their civil rights mission.

So, the key points are:
1. NAACP condemns Tea Party for racism, asks them to reject bigots.
2. Tea Party denies racism, accuses NAACP of political ploys.
3. Reference to March incident with no evidence.
4. Tea Party's own resolution against NAACP.
5. Tea Party defends against racism charges.
6. NAACP's political shift criticized by Tea Party members.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the moral framing from the article. The NAACP is framing the issue as a moral responsibility to reject bigotry, while the Tea Party is countering by accusing the NAACP of being politically motivated and irrelevant.

I should structure the summary to include both perspectives, highlighting the moral stance each side is taking. Also, mention the incident and the responses from both sides without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's concise and includes all main points.

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to reject bigotry. While the Tea Party denies these accusations, claiming they are politically motivated, the NAACP emphasizes the moral responsibility to oppose racism. The resolution references a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets, though no visual evidence exists. Tea Party leaders counter by accusing the NAACP of exploiting race issues and becoming politically biased, with some members drafting their own resolution to condemn the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan." Both sides frame the issue through moral lenses, with the NAACP focusing on racial justice and the Tea Party asserting fiscal responsibility and anti-political bias. This exchange highlights the ongoing debate over the role of race and politics in contemporary movements. END OF SUMMARY.
