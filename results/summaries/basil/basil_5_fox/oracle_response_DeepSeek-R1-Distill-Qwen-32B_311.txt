Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement. They called on Tea Party leaders to repudiate bigotry. The Tea Party members, however, claim this is just a political ploy. The NAACP's resolution initially criticized the Tea Party for racism and trying to push the country back to the pre-civil rights era, but they later amended it to target bigots within the Tea Party instead of all members. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said they don't take issue with the Tea Party itself but with its tolerance for bigotry, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. They referenced a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members denied this, saying there's no visual evidence.

The St. Louis Tea Party drafted their own resolution condemning the NAACP, calling them "bigoted" and "partisan." The NAACP's resolution also mentioned educating their members about the Tea Party's potential dangers. Tea Party organizers often deny racism, disavow racially charged signs, and accuse the NAACP of being irrelevant and politically motivated. Some Tea Party members even argue that the NAACP has failed African-Americans and that the Tea Party's principles could help the community.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping as many of the morally framed words as possible. The key points are:

1. NAACP condemns Tea Party's racist elements, asking them to repudiate bigotry.
2. Tea Party members deny racism, call the resolution a political ploy.
3. Reference to the March incident with racial epithets, but no visual evidence.
4. St. Louis Tea Party condemns NAACP as bigoted and partisan.
5. NAACP's resolution aims to educate about Tea Party's potential dangers.
6. Tea Party accuses NAACP of failure in their mission and being irrelevant.

I should structure this into a concise summary, making sure to include words like bigotry, racism, repudiate, tolerance, antisemitism, homophobia, attack, dangerous, failure, destruction, segregation, oppression, harm.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes these moral terms.

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry. While the Tea Party claims the resolution is a political ploy, the NAACP highlights the movement's tolerance for racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. They referenced a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though no visual evidence was produced. The St. Louis Tea Party responded by condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan," accusing them of failure in their mission. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate about the Tea Party's potential dangers, emphasizing that the movement's influence must reject racism and bigotry. Tea Party organizers deny these allegations, asserting their commitment to smaller government and fiscal responsibility, while accusing the NAACP of being irrelevant and politically motivated. The debate underscores tensions over the role of race and ideology in contemporary politics.
