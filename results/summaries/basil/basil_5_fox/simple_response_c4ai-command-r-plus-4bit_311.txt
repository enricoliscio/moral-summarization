SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the Tea Party movement for its "racist elements" and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and discrimination within their ranks. Despite claims from Tea Partiers that the resolution is a political tactic, the NAACP maintains that it supports freedom of assembly and speech but stands against racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. The NAACP references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial slurs at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have disputed these claims and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card." The NAACP's resolution calls on the Tea Party to accept responsibility and denounce bigoted behavior, while the St. Louis Tea Party has responded by condemning the NAACP for becoming a "partisan attack dog organization." The debate has sparked strong reactions from both sides, with the NAACP urging education on the issues and the Tea Party defending its principles of smaller government and fiscal responsibility. The resolution highlights the tension between these two organizations and their differing views on race and civil rights in America today. END OF SUMMARY.
