SUMMARY: The NAACP, the nation's leading civil rights group, has condemned "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and discrimination. The resolution, passed at the NAACP's annual convention, highlights an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial slurs at black lawmakers, and expresses concern about the movement's attempt to push the country back to a pre-civil rights era. While the NAACP has amended the resolution to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers, they maintain that the movement has tolerated bigoted statements and actions. Tea Party members, however, deny any racist behavior and accuse the NAACP of playing politics and being irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a partisan attack dog organization. The debate surrounding the resolution highlights ongoing tensions between the two groups and raises questions about the nature of racism and discrimination in modern America.
