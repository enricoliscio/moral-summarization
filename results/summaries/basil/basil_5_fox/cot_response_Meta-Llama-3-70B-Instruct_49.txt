SUMMARY:
The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and accept responsibility for tolerating bigoted statements. The resolution was amended to focus on the movement's tolerance of bigotry rather than accusing all Tea Partiers of being racist. NAACP leaders cited an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members have denied these claims, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution, condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted, false, and inflammatory" statement. The debate highlights the tension between the two groups, with the NAACP calling for the Tea Party to reject racism and the Tea Party accusing the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission.
