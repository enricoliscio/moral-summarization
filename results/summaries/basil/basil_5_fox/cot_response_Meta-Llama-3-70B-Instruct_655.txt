SUMMARY:
The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and urging its leaders to repudiate "bigotry" and "anti-Semitism". The resolution was amended to focus on the movement's tolerance of "bigots" rather than criticizing all Tea Partiers. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that the organization takes issue with the Tea Party's "continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements". Tea Party members have denied allegations of racism, with some accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant". The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack. The debate highlights the tension between the two groups, with the NAACP calling for the Tea Party to reject "racism" and "homophobia", and the Tea Party accusing the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission.
