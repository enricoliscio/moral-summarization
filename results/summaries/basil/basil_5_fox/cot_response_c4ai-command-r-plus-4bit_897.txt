SUMMARY:
The NAACP has condemned "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The civil rights group's resolution was passed unanimously, despite pushback from Tea Partiers who deny any racist behavior and accuse the NAACP of playing politics. The NAACP's resolution highlights an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets against black lawmakers, and the organization's leaders believe the movement tolerates bigotry and bigoted statements. Tea Party members, however, challenge these accusations and claim they welcome minorities. They further argue that the NAACP is acting in a partisan manner and has abandoned the fight for civil rights. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within their ranks. The St. Louis Tea Party responded by condemning the NAACP for what they perceive as malicious and bigoted behavior, accusing the organization of doing more harm than good for those in need. END OF SUMMARY.
