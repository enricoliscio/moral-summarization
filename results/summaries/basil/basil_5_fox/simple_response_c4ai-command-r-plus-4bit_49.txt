SUMMARY: The NAACP, the nation's leading civil rights group, has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. While the NAACP acknowledges the Tea Party's right to freedom of assembly, it takes issue with the movement's tolerance for bigoted statements and actions. The resolution was sparked by an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial slurs at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members have disputed these claims. The NAACP's resolution calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within its ranks. In response, Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing politics and abandoning the black community. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The debate has sparked a heated exchange between the two groups, with the NAACP calling for the Tea Party to accept responsibility for influencing its members, while Tea Party members insist that they welcome diversity and denounce racism.
END OF SUMMARY.
