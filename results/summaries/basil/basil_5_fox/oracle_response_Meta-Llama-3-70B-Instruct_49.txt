SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution accuses the Tea Party of attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era" and criticizes their tolerance for bigoted statements, including racism, antisemitism, and homophobia. NAACP leaders cited an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members have denied these claims, calling the NAACP's resolution a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog" move. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution, accusing the NAACP of reducing itself to a "bigoted" organization and abandoning the African-American community. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party's "racist element" and its potential to become more dangerous. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle against racism, segregation, and oppression in the US.
