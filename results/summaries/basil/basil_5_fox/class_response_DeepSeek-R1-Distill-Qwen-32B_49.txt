Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I should include. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning the Tea Party for racism and bigotry. They used strong terms like "racist elements" and "bigoted statements." The Tea Party members denied these accusations, calling them political ploys. The NAACP's president mentioned freedom of assembly but criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of racism. They referenced an incident where racial epithets were allegedly hurled, but there's no visual evidence.

The Tea Party responded by accusing the NAACP of playing the race card and being irrelevant. They drafted their own resolution condemning the NAACP as bigoted and partisan. The NAACP's resolution also mentions educating the community about the Tea Party's potential dangers. The Tea Party organizers defend themselves, saying they stand for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and accuse the NAACP of failing African-Americans.

I need to include words like adopted, racist, bigotry, freedom, tolerance, attack, educate, movement, incident, failure, destruction, oppression, harm, morphing. I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures both sides' moral arguments.

Let me structure it: start with the NAACP's action, their reasons, the Tea Party's denial, the incident, the counter-resolution, and the broader debate about the NAACP's role. I'll make sure to use the moral terms appropriately.

SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, passed at their annual convention, criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of bigoted statements and urged them to reject anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the group's support for freedom of assembly but condemned the movement's failure to address racism within its ranks. The resolution referenced an alleged incident where Tea Party protesters hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though no visual evidence was produced. Tea Party members denied the accusations, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and morphing into a partisan organization. They drafted their own resolution condemning the NAACP for its bigoted and inflammatory stance. The debate highlights the tension between civil rights advocacy and the Tea Party's focus on smaller government and fiscal responsibility, with critics arguing the NAACP has abandoned its mission to address poverty and segregation in the African-American community. END OF SUMMARY.
