SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, criticizes the Tea Party's tolerance for bigotry, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and racism. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assemble, but rather with its failure to condemn and distance itself from bigoted statements and actions. The resolution references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, which Tea Party members have denied. In response, the St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution accusing the NAACP of being "bigoted" and "partisan," and of abandoning the African-American community. The NAACP stands firm in its condemnation of the Tea Party's tolerance for racism and bigotry, urging the movement to take responsibility for its influence and promote freedom and equality for all.
