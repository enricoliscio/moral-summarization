SUMMARY: 
The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. While the NAACP takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assemble and freedom of speech, they are concerned about the tolerance of bigotry and racist statements within the movement. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and repudiate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. NAACP leaders reference an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have disputed these claims and no visual evidence has been found. The Tea Party has defended itself against charges of racism, disavowing racially charged signs that appear at protests. The resolution was met with backlash from Tea Party organizers, who accused the NAACP of playing politics and abandoning the true fight against segregation and oppression. They further criticized the NAACP for morphing into a partisan organization that no longer prioritizes civil rights. The final wording of the resolution will be released in October, pending approval from the NAACP's national board of directors.
