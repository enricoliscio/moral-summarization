SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution was passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, despite pushback from Tea Party members who denied any racist behavior and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card." The NAACP referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party activists challenged these claims and no visual evidence has been produced. The final wording of the resolution calls on the Tea Party to "repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party," while also acknowledging the movement's right to freedom of assembly and speech. The NAACP President, Benjamin Todd Jealous, emphasized that the issue is with the Tea Party's tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for what it sees as a partisan attack and abandoning its original mission of fighting segregation and oppression. The NAACP's resolution has sparked debate and criticism from Tea Party organizers, who defend their movement as inclusive and denounce any racially charged signs or behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
