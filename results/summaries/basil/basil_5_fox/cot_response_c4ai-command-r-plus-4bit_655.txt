SUMMARY:
The NAACP has passed a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, despite pushback from Tea Party members who deny any racist behavior and accuse the NAACP of playing "the race card." The resolution calls on Tea Party leaders to repudiate bigotry and distance themselves from bigoted statements made by some within their ranks. While the NAACP acknowledges the Tea Party's right to freedom of assembly, they argue that the movement has tolerated racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. The NAACP references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets against black lawmakers, while Tea Party members deny any racist behavior and challenge the lack of visual evidence. The resolution has sparked a heated debate, with the St. Louis Tea Party condemning the NAACP for what they perceive as a partisan and bigoted attack. The NAACP maintains that the Tea Party movement has the potential to become more dangerous and harmful for certain communities, urging Tea Party leaders to take responsibility for eradicating bigotry from their movement.
