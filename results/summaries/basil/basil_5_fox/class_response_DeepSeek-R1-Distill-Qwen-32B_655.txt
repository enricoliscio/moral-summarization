Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the NAACP's resolution against the Tea Party movement. They also listed specific morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party, which the Tea Party members deny. There's mention of an incident where racial epithets were allegedly used, but no visual evidence. The NAACP's resolution was amended to target bigots within the Tea Party, not the entire movement. The Tea Party responds by accusing the NAACP of being irrelevant and using political tactics, even drafting their own resolution.

Now, I need to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should structure it to highlight the NAACP's stance, the Tea Party's response, and the underlying issues like racism, bigotry, and the debate over their influence.

I'll start by stating the NAACP's adoption of the resolution, mentioning the terms "racist elements" and "bigotry." Then, I'll note the Tea Party's denial and the March incident, using "allegedly" and "attack." Next, I'll include the NAACP's stance on freedom and tolerance, then the Tea Party's accusations of the NAACP being irrelevant and bigoted.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, covering both sides and the moral implications. I'll make sure to include words like "push," "bigots," "freedom," "tolerance," "bigoted," "anti-Semitism," "homophobia," "attack," "playing," "educate," "movement," "incident," "failure," "destruction," "segregation," "oppression," and "harm."

Finally, I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure all key points are covered without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution initially criticized the Tea Party for attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era," though it was amended to focus on bigots within the movement rather than all Tea Partiers. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the organization's support for freedom of assembly while condemning the movement's tolerance for bigotry, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution referenced an alleged incident in March where Tea Party protesters hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members denied these claims, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and of being irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP as a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The NAACP's resolution also aimed to educate its membership about the potential dangers of the Tea Party movement, while Tea Party organizers fired back, accusing the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission and contributing to poverty and family breakdown in the African-American community. The debate highlights ongoing tensions over racism, freedom, and the role of political movements in shaping societal values. END OF SUMMARY.
