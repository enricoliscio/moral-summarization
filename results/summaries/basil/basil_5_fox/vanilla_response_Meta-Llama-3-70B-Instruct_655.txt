SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution was passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous stated that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party movement, but rather with its tolerance of bigotry and bigoted statements. The resolution references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Tea Party members have denied the allegations and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog" behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
