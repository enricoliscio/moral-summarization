SUMMARY:
The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution accuses the Tea Party of tolerating bigotry and bigoted statements, citing an incident in March where protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members deny the allegations, claiming there is no proof of racist behavior and accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The NAACP president emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party movement, but rather with its tolerance for bigotry and anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. The resolution calls on the Tea Party to accept responsibility and make clear that there is no place for racism and bigotry in their movement. END OF SUMMARY.
