SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, asks Tea Party leaders to take responsibility for the bigoted statements and actions of some of their members. The NAACP cites an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Tea Party members have denied the allegations, calling the NAACP's resolution a "bigoted" and "partisan attack." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution, condemning the NAACP for reducing itself to a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The NAACP's resolution is seen as a call to action, urging the Tea Party to reject racism and bigotry within its ranks.
