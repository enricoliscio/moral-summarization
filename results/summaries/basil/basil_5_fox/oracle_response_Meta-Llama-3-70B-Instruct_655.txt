SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution accuses the Tea Party of attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era" and criticizes their tolerance for bigoted statements and actions. The NAACP references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, which Tea Party members deny. The Tea Party has responded by accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being an "irrelevant" and "bigoted" organization. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for its "partisan attack dog" tactics. The debate centers around issues of racism, antisemitism, homophobia, and segregation, with the NAACP calling on the Tea Party to take responsibility for its influence and reject harmful ideologies.
