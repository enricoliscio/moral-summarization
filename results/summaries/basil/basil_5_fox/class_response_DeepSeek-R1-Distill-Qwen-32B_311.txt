Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and uses as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party, using terms like "racist," "bigotry," and "racism." They're concerned about the movement pushing the country back to a pre-civil rights era. The Tea Party members are defending themselves, saying the NAACP is playing politics and using the "race card." There's an incident mentioned where protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets, but no visual evidence. The NAACP's resolution was amended to target bigots within the Tea Party, not all members. The Tea Party is countering with their own resolutions, calling the NAACP bigoted and irrelevant. They argue the NAACP has abandoned its mission and is now a political tool.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by mentioning the NAACP's adoption of the resolution, using "adopted" and "racist elements." I'll note their concern about the movement pushing the country back, using "push." I'll include the amended language about repudiating bigots, using "bigots" and "bigoted." Then, I'll mention the incident and the lack of evidence, using "allegedly" and "attack." I'll describe the Tea Party's response, using "playing" the race card and "accused" of being irrelevant. I'll also include the St. Louis Tea Party's resolution, using "fired" and "bigoted." Finally, I'll touch on the debate over the NAACP's role, using "abandoning," "poverty," "breakdown," "failure," and "destruction." I'll end by noting the ongoing debate over their mission and impact, using "segregation," "oppression," and "harm."

I need to ensure all the key morally charged words are included without making the summary too lengthy. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response, and the ongoing debate. Keeping each sentence concise will help stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry, despite claims that the measure is a political ploy. The resolution initially criticized the Tea Party for "push[ing] our country back to the pre-civil rights era" but was amended to focus on bigots within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the group's opposition to racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia, while acknowledging the Tea Party's right to assemble. The resolution referenced an alleged incident where Tea Party protesters hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though no visual evidence was produced. Tea Party members, including Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis, accused the NAACP of "playing the race card" and dismissed the claims as unsupported. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution, condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan." The NAACP's resolution also criticized the movement for potentially becoming "more dangerous" and urged its members to "educate" the public about its risks. Tea Party organizers denied racism, disavowing racially charged signs and accusing the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission. The debate over the NAACP's role and the Tea Party's influence continues, with both sides accusing each other of harm and morphing into partisan organizations. END OF SUMMARY.
