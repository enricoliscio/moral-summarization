Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP's resolution regarding the Tea Party movement. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party. They called on Tea Party leaders to repudiate bigotry. This happened at their annual convention in Kansas City, Mo. The initial resolution was stronger, directly accusing the Tea Party of racism, but it was amended to be less harsh, focusing instead on asking them to reject bigots within their ranks.

The NAACP's president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, made a statement emphasizing their support for freedom of assembly but taking issue with the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry. He mentioned an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs towards black lawmakers. However, Tea Party members denied these allegations, stating there's no visual evidence.

Tea Party leaders, like Phillip Dennis from Dallas, accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and claimed their movement is open to minorities, focusing on smaller government and fiscal responsibility. They even drafted their own resolution condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan."

The NAACP's resolution was expected to reference the March incident, and they plan to release the final version after their national board approves it in October. Tea Party organizers continue to deny any racism, disavowing any offensive signs at their protests.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main actions: NAACP's resolution, the amendment, the incident reference, the Tea Party's response, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to highlight both sides' arguments and the key points each side is making.

Let me structure it: Start with the NAACP's action, their stance, the incident, the Tea Party's denial, their counter-resolution, and the broader context of the debate. Keep it concise, ensuring each point is clear without going into too much detail.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary straightforward. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows logically from one point to the next. Double-checking for clarity and that all main points are covered without unnecessary details.
