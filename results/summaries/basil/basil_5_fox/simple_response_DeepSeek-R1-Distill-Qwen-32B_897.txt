Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user has specified that I should preserve the moral framing provided by the author. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral implications presented.

The article discusses the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning the Tea Party movement for racist elements. The NAACP's resolution was amended to focus on repudiating bigotry within the Tea Party rather than condemning the entire movement. They cited an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets. However, Tea Party members denied these allegations, claiming there's no visual evidence and accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card."

I need to capture both sides of the argument. On one side, the NAACP is standing against racism and promoting inclusion. On the other, the Tea Party feels unfairly targeted and accuses the NAACP of being irrelevant and partisan. It's important to highlight the moral stances each side takesâ€”NAACP fighting against discrimination, Tea Party asserting their commitment to smaller government and fiscal responsibility, while accusing the NAACP of bias.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral framing without taking sides. I'll structure it by first stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response, and conclude with the ongoing debate about the NAACP's role in society.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and sticks to the key points without unnecessary details. I'll make sure to mention the resolution, the incident, the Tea Party's denial, their accusations against the NAACP, and the broader debate about the NAACP's relevance and priorities.

SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to reject bigotry. While the resolution initially criticized the Tea Party, it was amended to focus on repudiating bigots within the movement rather than condemning it entirely. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized support for freedom of assembly but criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry, citing an alleged incident where protesters hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members denied the allegations, accusing the NAACP of political opportunism and irrelevance. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan," while other Tea Party leaders defended their commitment to smaller government and fiscal responsibility, accusing the NAACP of failing to address systemic issues in the African-American community. The debate highlights tensions over race, politics, and the NAACP's role in contemporary society. END OF SUMMARY.
