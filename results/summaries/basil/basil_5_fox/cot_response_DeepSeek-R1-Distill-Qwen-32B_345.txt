Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. They mentioned that I should identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a summary using those words as much as possible. 

Looking at the article, it's about the NAACP condemning the Tea Party movement for racism. I should start by identifying words that carry moral connotations. Words like "condemning," "racist," "bigotry," "pre-civil rights era," "tolerance," "bigoted," "homophobia," "irrelevant," "bigoted," "partisan," "inflammatory," "failure," "bigotry," "oppression," "vital," "shell," "harm," "good," "break," "failure," "destruction," "vital," "shell," "harm," "good," "break," "failure," "destruction," "vital," "shell," "harm," "good," "break," "failure," "destruction." 

Wait, some of these might be repeated, but I'll list them all as per the user's instruction. Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. I should highlight the NAACP's stance, the Tea Party's response, and the underlying tensions between them. 

I should mention the resolution, the March incident, the Tea Party's denial, and the accusations of the NAACP being irrelevant or bigoted. Also, include the counter-resolution from the St. Louis Tea Party and the broader debate about the NAACP's role in the community. 

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the moral arguments from both sides. Keeping it concise but informative, making sure not to exceed 200 words. Let me structure it by first stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's reaction, followed by the broader implications and accusations. That should cover all the key points while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. While the resolution initially criticized the Tea Party for attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era," it was amended to focus on rejecting bigots within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized support for freedom of assembly but criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution referenced a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members denied the claims, calling them baseless and accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card." Tea Party leaders, such as Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis, claimed the movement welcomes minorities and accused the NAACP of being irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" stance. The NAACP's resolution also criticized the Tea Party for potentially becoming "more dangerous" for those who feel the country has been "taken away" from them. Tea Party organizers denied racism, disavowing any racially charged signs at protests. The debate highlights tensions over the NAACP's role in addressing civil rights versus its perceived shift toward partisanship. END OF SUMMARY.
