SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, urges the Tea Party to take responsibility for tolerating racism and anti-Semitism within its ranks. NAACP leaders cited an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members, however, deny any racist behavior and accuse the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack. The NAACP stands firm, emphasizing the need for the Tea Party to reject bigotry and ensure there is no place for racism in its movement.

END OF SUMMARY.
