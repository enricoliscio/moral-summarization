SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, despite accusations from Tea Party members that the resolution is a political maneuver. The NAACP's resolution calls on Tea Party leaders to denounce bigotry and discrimination within their ranks, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. While the NAACP acknowledges the Tea Party's right to freedom of assembly, they maintain that the movement has tolerated and failed to adequately address bigoted statements and behaviors. This resolution comes in response to an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial slurs against black lawmakers, although Tea Party members have disputed these claims. The NAACP's resolution aims to highlight the dangers of allowing such discriminatory attitudes to persist within the movement. Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against accusations of racism, but the NAACP maintains that the movement must take responsibility and actively work to eradicate discrimination. The St. Louis Tea Party has responded by condemning the NAACP for what they perceive as partisan attacks, accusing them of abandoning their original mission of fighting for civil rights. END OF SUMMARY.
