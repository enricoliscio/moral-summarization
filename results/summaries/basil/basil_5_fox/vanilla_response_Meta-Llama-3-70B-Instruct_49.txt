SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, asks Tea Party leaders to take responsibility for tolerating bigotry and to make clear that there is no place for racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry in their movement. NAACP leaders cited an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Tea Party members have denied the allegations and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization" behavior. The NAACP resolution is expected to be finalized in October.
