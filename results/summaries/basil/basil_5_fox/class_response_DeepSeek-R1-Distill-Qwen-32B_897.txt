Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party. They called on Tea Party leaders to repudiate bigotry, despite the Tea Partiers claiming it's a political ploy. The resolution initially was stronger but was amended to focus on bigots within their ranks. The NAACP's president mentioned they support freedom of assembly but take issue with tolerance of bigotry. They referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets. Tea Party members denied the allegations and accused the NAACP of playing the race card and being irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted their own resolution condemning the NAACP as bigoted and partisan. The NAACP's resolution also mentions educating the community about the movement's potential dangers. Tea Party organizers defend themselves against racism charges, disavowing racially charged signs. The NAACP is accused of abandoning civil rights and morphing into a political organization, causing harm to the African-American community.

Now, I need to extract the key points and use the morally framed words. I'll start by noting the NAACP's adoption of the resolution, using "adopted." They're condemning "racist elements" and calling out "bigotry." The Tea Party claims it's a political ploy, so "political ploy" is relevant. The NAACP's president mentions "freedom of assembly" and taking issue with "tolerance for bigotry." They referenced an "incident" where racial epithets were "hurled." The Tea Party denied the allegations, so "allegedly" and "attack" are relevant. They accused the NAACP of "playing the race card" and being "irrelevant." The St. Louis Tea Party fired a resolution calling the NAACP "bigoted" and "partisan." The NAACP's resolution aims to "educate" the public about the movement's potential dangers. Tea Party organizers disavow "racially charged signs." The NAACP is accused of "abandoning" civil rights and "morphing" into a political group, causing "harm."

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to first state the NAACP's action, their reasons, the Tea Party's response, and the broader implications. I'll also include the accusations and counter-accusations between the two groups.

I should keep each sentence concise and ensure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, checking word count as I go.

First sentence: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party movement, calling on leaders to repudiate bigotry. This uses "adopted," "condemning," "racist," "bigotry."

Next: Despite claims from Tea Partiers that the measure was a political ploy, the NAACP emphasized freedom of assembly while taking issue with the movement's tolerance of bigoted statements. This includes "despite," "political ploy," "emphasized," "freedom," "taking issue," "tolerance," "bigoted statements."

Then: The resolution referenced an incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members denied the allegations, accusing the NAACP of playing the race card and being irrelevant. This uses "referenced," "incident," "allegedly," "hurled," "denied," "accusing," "playing," "race card," "irrelevant."

Next: The St. Louis Tea Party fired a resolution calling the NAACP bigoted and partisan, while the NAACP aimed to educate the public about the movement's potential dangers. This includes "fired," "calling," "bigoted," "partisan," "aimed," "educate," "potential dangers."

Finally: The debate highlights ongoing tensions between the civil rights group and the Tea Party over accusations of racism and the NAACP's role in addressing issues like poverty and segregation. This uses "highlights," "tensions," "accusations," "racism," "addressing," "poverty," "segregation."

Now, I'll count the words to ensure it's under 200. The summary is concise and includes all the necessary moral framing words. I think this covers all the key points and preserves the author's moral stance.
