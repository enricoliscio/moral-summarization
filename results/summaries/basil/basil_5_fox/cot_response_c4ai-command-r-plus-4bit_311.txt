SUMMARY:
The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and prejudice. The civil rights group's resolution, passed unanimously, asks the Tea Party to take responsibility for any acts of discrimination within its ranks and to denounce anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. The NAACP referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly used racial epithets against black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have challenged these claims and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card." The resolution sparked a strong reaction from Tea Party groups, who defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of becoming a partisan attack organization. They demanded the NAACP retract its resolution, claiming it was bigoted and inflammatory. The Tea Party organizers disavowed any racially charged signs that appeared at their protests but struggled to distance themselves from the accusation that their movement tolerates racism.
