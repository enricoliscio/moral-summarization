SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and called on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, asks the Tea Party to accept responsibility and denounce racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within their movement. NAACP leaders reference an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have disputed these claims and no visual evidence has been found. The NAACP's resolution sparked strong reactions from Tea Party groups, who accused the NAACP of playing politics and abandoning its original mission to fight segregation and oppression. They demanded the NAACP withdraw its resolution, accusing it of being a "bigoted, false and inflammatory" attack on their movement. The Tea Party defends itself against charges of racism and distances itself from racially charged signs that appear at their protests. The St. Louis Tea Party organizer accused the NAACP of becoming a partisan organization, neglecting civil rights, and failing to address the real issues facing the African-American community, such as crime, poverty, and family breakdown.
