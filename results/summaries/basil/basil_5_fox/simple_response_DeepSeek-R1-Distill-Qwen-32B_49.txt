Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NAACP and the Tea Party. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about the NAACP adopting a resolution condemning racist elements in the Tea Party. They mention the NAACP's stance and the Tea Party's response. I should make sure to include both sides' perspectives on the issue of racism and the accusations of political ploys.

First, I'll note the key points: NAACP condemns Tea Party for racism, Tea Party denies it, mentions the March incident, the NAACP's amended resolution, and the Tea Party's counter-resolutions. I need to keep the moral aspects, so I should highlight the NAACP's concern about tolerance of bigotry and the Tea Party's accusations of the NAACP being irrelevant and political.

I should structure the summary to show both sides without taking a stance, just presenting their arguments. Make sure it's concise, under 200 words. Let me start drafting: The NAACP condemns Tea Party for racism, Tea Party denies, mentions the March incident, NAACP's amended resolution, Tea Party's counter-resolutions, accusations of the NAACP being irrelevant and political, and the ongoing debate.

Wait, I should also mention the NAACP's call for the Tea Party to repudiate bigots and their own commitment to civil rights. And the Tea Party's focus on smaller government and fiscal responsibility, accusing NAACP of failing the African-American community.

I think that covers the main points. Let me make sure it's all within the word limit and flows well.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has condemned "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to reject bigotry, while Tea Party members deny such claims, accusing the NAACP of political bias. The NAACP's resolution, adopted at its annual convention, initially criticized the Tea Party for promoting a pre-civil rights era but was amended to focus on addressing bigotry within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized support for freedom of assembly but criticized the Tea Party's tolerance of racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution referenced a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members denied the allegations, claiming no visual evidence exists. Tea Party leaders, like Dallas founder Phillip Dennis, accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and called the organization irrelevant. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan." The NAACP's resolution also aims to educate its membership about the Tea Party's potential dangers, while Tea Party organizers defend their movement as focused on smaller government and fiscal responsibility, accusing the NAACP of failing African-American communities. The debate highlights tensions over race, politics, and the role of civil rights organizations. END OF SUMMARY.
