SUMMARY: The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution was passed at the NAACP's annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri, and calls on the Tea Party to reject racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry within its ranks. The NAACP referenced an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, but Tea Party members have challenged these claims and no visual evidence has been produced. Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing politics. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for becoming a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization." The final wording of the NAACP resolution won't be released until October, but it calls on the Tea Party to repudiate racist elements and activities within its movement. Tea Party organizers continue to disavow racially charged signs that appear at protests and deny that the movement is racist.
END OF SUMMARY.
