SUMMARY:

The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution, passed unanimously at the NAACP's annual convention, criticizes the Tea Party's tolerance for bigotry and anti-Semitic, homophobic, and racist statements. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's right to assembly, but rather with its failure to address racism and bigotry within its ranks. The resolution references an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. Tea Party members have denied these claims, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant." In response, the St. Louis Tea Party drafted a resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog" behavior. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party's tolerance for racism and bigotry.
