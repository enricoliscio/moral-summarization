Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the NAACP adopting a resolution against the Tea Party movement for racism. I should focus on the key points: the resolution, the NAACP's stance, the Tea Party's response, and the moral implications on both sides.

First, I'll note that the NAACP condemns "racist elements" in the Tea Party, asking leaders to repudiate bigotry. They mention the March incident with racial epithets, but Tea Party members deny it. The NAACP's president emphasizes freedom of assembly but criticizes the Tea Party's tolerance of bigotry.

Next, the Tea Party responds by accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being irrelevant. They argue against the resolution, calling it a political ploy. The St. Louis Tea Party even drafted their own resolution against the NAACP, calling them bigoted and partisan.

I should also include the NAACP's broader concerns about the Tea Party's potential dangers, beyond taxes and government. The Tea Party organizers defend themselves, disavowing any racism and arguing for smaller government and fiscal responsibility. They also criticize the NAACP's effectiveness in addressing African-American issues.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral arguments from both sides. I'll structure it to first present the NAACP's resolution and its reasoning, then the Tea Party's counterarguments, and conclude with the broader implications of the debate.

SUMMARY: The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, urging its leaders to reject bigotry. The resolution, passed at the group's annual convention, initially criticized the Tea Party for promoting a return to the pre-civil rights era but was amended to focus on addressing bigotry within the movement. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized support for freedom of assembly while condemning the Tea Party's tolerance of racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution references a March incident where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members deny these claims and argue the NAACP is using the "race card" politically. Tea Party leaders, like Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis, claim the movement is open to all and accuses the NAACP of being irrelevant and partisan. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for bigotry and urging it to withdraw its resolution. The debate highlights tensions over the role of race, politics, and civil rights in contemporary America. END OF SUMMARY.
