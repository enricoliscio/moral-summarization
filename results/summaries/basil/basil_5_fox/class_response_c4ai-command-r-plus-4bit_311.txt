SUMMARY: The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution highlights the NAACP's concern about the tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements within the Tea Party movement, including anti-Semitism and homophobia. Despite claims from Tea Party members that the measure is politically motivated, the NAACP maintains that it supports freedom of assembly but takes issue with the movement's continued tolerance for racism. The resolution was passed after an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, and references the NAACP's belief that the movement could push the country back to the pre-civil rights era. Tea Party organizers have defended themselves against charges of racism and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card." The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP for what it sees as a partisan and bigoted attack. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its members and the community about the potential dangers of the Tea Party movement, while the St. Louis Tea Party has fired back, accusing the NAACP of abandoning black America and causing harm to the community.
END OF SUMMARY.
