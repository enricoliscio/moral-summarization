Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they probably need a concise summary that captures the essence and the ethical elements discussed.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning the Tea Party for racist elements and bigotry. They're asking the Tea Party leaders to repudiate such behavior. The Tea Party members are defending themselves, saying it's just a political ploy and that there's no proof of racism. They even accused the NAACP of being irrelevant and playing the race card.

I notice the author used specific morally charged words like "racist," "bigotry," "freedom," "tolerance," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be no longer than 200 words, so I have to be concise but comprehensive.

I'll start by stating the NAACP's action, then the Tea Party's response. I should mention the March incident as context. Also, include the NAACP's stance on freedom and their call for responsibility. Then, highlight the Tea Party's accusations against the NAACP, like being irrelevant and a political tactic. Finally, note that the NAACP's resolution is pending approval.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without getting bogged down in details. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral element is touched upon briefly.

SUMMARY:  
The NAACP adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and racism. The resolution, initially stronger in its criticism, was amended to focus on addressing bigots within the Tea Party while affirming support for freedom of assembly. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized the need for the Tea Party to reject racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The resolution referenced an alleged March incident where Tea Party protesters hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers, though Tea Party members denied these claims, accusing the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being irrelevant. Tea Party leaders, like Dallas founder Phillip Dennis, argued the movement is open to minorities and opposes racial discrimination. The St. Louis Tea Party drafted its own resolution condemning the NAACP as "bigoted" and "partisan," while Tea Party organizers continue to deny racism, disavowing racially charged signs at protests. The NAACP resolution, first reported by the Kansas City Star, aims to educate the public about the movement's potential dangers, though its final wording remains pending approval. Tea Party critics accused the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission and morphing into a political organization, with some even urging the IRS to reconsider its tax-exempt status. END OF SUMMARY.
