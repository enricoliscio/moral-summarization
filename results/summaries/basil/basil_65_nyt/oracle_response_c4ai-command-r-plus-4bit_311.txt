SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump have had limited yet cordial interactions over the years, despite their differing circles within New York's ultrarich community. Their paths have crossed on golf courses and TV sets, with Bloomberg even appearing on Trump's show, "The Apprentice." However, their relationship has soured since Trump's presidential candidacy, with Bloomberg labeling Trump a public menace and questioning his sanity. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump's election, highlighting that Trump is "crazy" and that "you can't fix crazy." This moral assessment of Trump has created a rift between the two billionaires, with Trump counterattacking by speculating about Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerabilities. Their relationship, once marked by friendly tweets, has now taken on a more antagonistic tone.
END OF SUMMARY.
