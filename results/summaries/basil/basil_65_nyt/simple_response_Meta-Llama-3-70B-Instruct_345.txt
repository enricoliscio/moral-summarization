SUMMARY:

The article highlights the contrasting personalities and values of two billionaires, Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump. Despite their cordial interactions in the past, Bloomberg has now labeled Trump a "public menace" and hinted that he may not be sane. The two men come from different circles of New York's elite, with Bloomberg known for his philanthropy and support of the arts, while Trump is seen as crude and ostentatious. Their limited interactions have been polite, including a charity golf event and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show. However, their relationship soured when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg explored a bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg's adviser noted that Trump's craziness cannot be fixed, and Trump has since retaliated with skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerability. The article portrays Trump as a self-serving, divisive figure, while Bloomberg is depicted as a more refined and responsible leader.
