SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's relationship has evolved from a cordial acquaintance to a bitter rivalry. In his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Bloomberg raged against Trump, labeling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. Despite their limited interactions over the years, their paths have crossed in New York's elite circles, on the golf course, and through their mutual connection via their daughters. While Bloomberg is known for his generous philanthropy and gracious support for the arts, Trump has a reputation for crudeness and ostentation. Their rivalry intensified during the 2016 presidential election when Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump's candidacy. Trump, in turn, has voiced skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and speculated about the vulnerability of his company. Once friendly acquaintances, their relationship has deteriorated into a bitter rivalry marked by counterattacks.
