SUMMARY:
At the Democratic National Convention, Michael R. Bloomberg labeled Donald J. Trump a "public menace" and hinted that he was not quite "sane". Despite their cordial interactions in the past, their differences are stark. Bloomberg is a "generous philanthropist" who supports the arts, whereas Trump is "flinty" in his giving and "crude" in his behavior. Bloomberg made his billions in finance and technology, while Trump got his start in real estate and became a reality-show celebrity. Their paths crossed on the golf course and on Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice". However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid to block Trump from being elected. Trump retaliated with skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerability. END OF SUMMARY.
