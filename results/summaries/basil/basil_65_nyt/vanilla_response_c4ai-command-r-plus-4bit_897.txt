SUMMARY: Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump have had limited interactions over the years despite their shared presence in New York City's wealthy circles. They have different backgrounds, interests, and personalities. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, made his fortune in finance and technology, while Trump started in real estate and became a casino magnate and reality TV star. Their paths occasionally crossed on the golf course and when Bloomberg appeared on Trump's show, "The Apprentice." Their daughters are also friends. Trump once praised Bloomberg's mayorship and his company, but their relationship soured when they became political rivals. Bloomberg considered running against Trump as an independent but ultimately decided against it to avoid helping Trump win. Trump has since criticized Bloomberg's wealth and company. Their relationship highlights the contrast between two powerful New Yorkers with vastly different approaches to business, politics, and public life.
