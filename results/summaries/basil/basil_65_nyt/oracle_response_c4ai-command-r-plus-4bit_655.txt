SUMMARY: Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's interactions have been limited but cordial over the years, despite their differing personalities and circles within New York's ultrarich community. While Bloomberg is known for his philanthropy and association with the city's cultural scene, Trump has a reputation for being less generous and more crude. Their paths have crossed on the golf course and when Bloomberg appeared on Trump's TV show, "The Apprentice." Their relationship began to sour when Trump announced his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg explored his own independent bid to block Trump from being elected. Bloomberg ultimately decided against running, fearing that he would help Trump win by splitting the vote. Trump has since attacked Bloomberg, questioning his wealth and business acumen. This deterioration of their relationship highlights the stark differences between the two billionaires, with Bloomberg positioning himself as a public-spirited philanthropist and Trump facing criticism as a public menace whose sanity has been questioned.
