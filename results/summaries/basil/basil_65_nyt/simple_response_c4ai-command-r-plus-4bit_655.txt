SUMMARY: Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and former president Donald Trump's relationship has evolved from limited yet cordial interactions as members of New York's ultrarich to a public feud fueled by their differing political aspirations and views. While Bloomberg and Trump had few dealings in the past, with Bloomberg even appearing on Trump's reality TV show, their relationship soured as they became political opponents. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump's election, highlighting the moral imperative of preventing a dangerous and unpredictable figure from gaining power. Trump responded with counterattacks, questioning Bloomberg's wealth and business acumen. The contrast between their public personas and behavior underscores the rift that has developed between these two powerful figures. END OF SUMMARY.
