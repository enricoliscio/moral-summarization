SUMMARY: Despite their limited interactions, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump have had a cordial relationship over the years, with Bloomberg even appearing on Trump's TV show, "The Apprentice." However, their relationship has soured since Trump's presidential candidacy, with Bloomberg labeling Trump a public menace and questioning his sanity. Bloomberg even explored a presidential bid as an independent to block Trump's election, though he ultimately decided against it to avoid helping Trump win. Trump, in turn, has counterattacked, speculating about Bloomberg's net worth and the vulnerability of his company. Their rift highlights the contrasting circles in which the two billionaires move, with Bloomberg known for his philanthropy and alignment with the cultural elite, while Trump embraces crudeness and reality TV fame. Sheekey, an adviser to Bloomberg, underscores the extent of their non-relationship, noting that they mostly would have crossed paths on golf courses or TV sets. Their differing approaches to wealth and public life further emphasize their contrasting moral frameworks. End of summary.
