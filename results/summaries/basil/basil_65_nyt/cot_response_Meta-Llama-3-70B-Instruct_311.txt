SUMMARY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist, labeled Donald J. Trump a "public menace" and hinted that he was not quite sane in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. Despite their cordial interactions in the past, Bloomberg and Trump existed in different circles of New York's ultrarich. Bloomberg, a supporter of the arts, is known for his sophisticated cultural scene, whereas Trump relishes in being crude. Their limited interactions included playing golf together and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg's adviser described Trump as "crazy," saying "you can't fix crazy." Trump, in turn, has made skeptical comments about Bloomberg's wealth and company. END OF SUMMARY.
