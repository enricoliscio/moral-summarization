SUMMARY: In their time in New York City, Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's interactions have been limited yet cordial. Despite their different circles and contrasting personalities, they had a few friendly interactions, such as playing golf together and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's show, "The Apprentice." Their daughters are also friends. However, their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg explored his own independent bid to block Trump's candidacy. Trump has since made negative comments about Bloomberg's wealth and business, claiming they are no longer friends.
END OF SUMMARY.
