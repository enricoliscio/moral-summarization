SUMMARY:

Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City, despite their vastly different backgrounds and values. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, has made his fortune in finance and technology, while Trump, known for being crude and flaunting his possessions, made his start in real estate and later became a reality-show celebrity. The two have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, with Bloomberg exploring an independent bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg has since labeled Trump a "public menace" and hinted that he's not quite "sane." Trump has retaliated, questioning Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerability. The two are now at odds, with Bloomberg warning that Trump's presidency would be a disaster, saying "God help us" if Trump were to "run the nation like he's run his business." END OF SUMMARY.
