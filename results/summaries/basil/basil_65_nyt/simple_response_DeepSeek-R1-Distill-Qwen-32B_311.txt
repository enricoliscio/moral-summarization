Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I should make sure I understand the key points and the underlying tone.

First, the article talks about how Bloomberg criticized Trump at the DNC, calling him a public menace and implying he's not sane. That's a strong moral statement against Trump. Then, it contrasts their backgrounds and interactions. Bloomberg is a philanthropist, supports arts, is modest with wealth. Trump is more ostentatious, started in real estate, and is a reality TV star.

They didn't interact much, except on golf courses and TV shows. Bloomberg even appeared on Trump's Apprentice. But when Trump ran for president, Bloomberg opposed him, even considering a third-party run. The summary should highlight their differing values and the shift from cordial to adversarial.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me outline the main points: Bloomberg's criticism, their limited interactions, their contrasting personas, the friendly past, and the breakdown of their relationship when Trump ran. Also, include the moral judgment against Trump.

I should start with Bloomberg's DNC speech, then contrast their backgrounds, mention their limited interactions, and the shift in their relationship when Trump ran. End with the moral framing of Trump as a danger. Make sure the summary flows and is concise.

Let me check if I included all key elements: Bloomberg's criticism, their differences, past interactions, political opposition, and the moral stance. I think that's covered. Now, condense it into a coherent summary without losing the moral angle.

SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg's DNC speech criticizing Donald Trump as a public menace and questioning his sanity contrasts with their limited yet cordial interactions in New York City. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and cultural patron, differs sharply from Trump, a real estate magnate and reality TV star, in style and values. Their encounters were rare, mostly on golf courses or TV, with Bloomberg appearing on Trump's "The Apprentice" and their daughters being friends. Trump once praised Bloomberg's mayoral tenure on Twitter. However, their relationship soured after Trump's 2016 candidacy, with Bloomberg opposing him and even considering a third-party run to block his election. Trump reciprocated by attacking Bloomberg's wealth and business. The article highlights their divergent values and the breakdown of their cordiality, framing Trump as a dangerous figure. END OF SUMMARY.
