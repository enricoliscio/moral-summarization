SUMMARY:

Michael Bloomberg's scathing criticism of Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention may have led many to believe that the two billionaires have a long-standing feud. However, according to those who know them, their interactions have been limited but cordial in the past. They moved in different circles of New York's elite, with Bloomberg being a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, while Trump was known for his crudeness and love of showing off his possessions. The two have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, and Bloomberg even appeared on Trump's reality TV show "The Apprentice" twice. However, their cordiality ended when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg's adviser, Kevin Sheekey, summed it up: "Trump is crazy" and "you can't fix crazy." Trump has since responded with counterattacks, claiming Bloomberg's company is vulnerable to competitors.

END OF SUMMARY.
