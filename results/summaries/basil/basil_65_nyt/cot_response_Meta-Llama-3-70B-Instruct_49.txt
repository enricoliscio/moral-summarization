SUMMARY:
Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, has been critical of Trump, labeling him a "public menace" and hinting that he's not quite sane. Their differences are stark, with Bloomberg known for his sophistication and Trump relishing in being crude. Despite their differences, they have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid to block Trump's election. Trump has since made counterattacks, voicing skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and company. END OF SUMMARY.
