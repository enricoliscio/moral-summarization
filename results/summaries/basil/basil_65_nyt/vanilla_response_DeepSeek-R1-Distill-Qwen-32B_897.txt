Alright, I need to summarize this article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about their relationship, which isn't as adversarial as it seems, despite Bloomberg's recent harsh criticisms. They don't interact much, but when they do, it's cordial. They belong to different circles in New York's elite: Bloomberg is a philanthropist and arts supporter, while Trump is more ostentatious and into real estate and TV.

They've met on golf courses and even appeared on each other's shows. Trump even praised Bloomberg when he was mayor. But things changed when Trump announced his candidacy. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump, though he later withdrew. Trump then criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business.

So, the summary should cover their limited interactions, their different backgrounds, the cordial meetings, and how their relationship soured when Trump ran for president. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

I should structure it by introducing their contrasting profiles, mention their occasional meetings, the shift when Trump ran, and the resulting tension. Make sure to highlight that despite their differences, their interactions were cordial until Trump's candidacy.
