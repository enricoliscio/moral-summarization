Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral aspects.

The article talks about how Bloomberg criticized Trump at the Democratic Convention, calling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. It contrasts their backgrounds: Bloomberg as a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, versus Trump as more ostentatious and crude. They didn't interact much in NYC, except for a few golf meetings and TV appearances. Bloomberg even supported Trump's show at one point. However, their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg tried to block him by considering a third-party run.

I need to highlight the moral framing, which seems to contrast their personalities and values. Bloomberg is portrayed as more responsible and civic-minded, while Trump is seen as unstable and self-centered. The summary should capture their differing approaches to wealth and public service, and how their interactions changed once Trump became a political rival.

I should structure the summary to first mention their public clash, then their limited but cordial past interactions, followed by the shift in their relationship when Trump ran for president. I'll need to keep it under 200 words and ensure it ends with the required tokens.

Let me draft it, making sure to include the moral elements and keep it concise.
