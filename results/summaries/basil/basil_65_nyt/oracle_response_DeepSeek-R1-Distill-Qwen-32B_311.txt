Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Michael Bloomberg's criticism of Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included in the summary: menace, sane, run, help, known, job, crazy.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems Bloomberg criticized Trump as a public menace and questioned his sanity. They have a history of limited but cordial interactions in New York. Bloomberg is a philanthropist and supports the arts, while Trump is more ostentatious and into real estate and media. They met on golf courses and even appeared on each other's TV shows. However, their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg considered running against him as an independent to block Trump. Trump later criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business.

Now, I need to make sure to include the moral words. "Menace" and "sane" are used by Bloomberg. "Run" refers to Trump's business approach. "Help" is part of Bloomberg's criticism. "Known" describes their reputations. "Job" relates to Bloomberg's support for the show. "Crazy" is used by Sheekey.

I'll structure the summary to highlight their contrasting profiles, their interactions, and the breakdown of their relationship when Trump ran for president. I'll ensure each of the moral words is included naturally. Also, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I should avoid adding any new moral framing beyond what's in the article. The summary should stick to the facts while preserving the author's moral tone. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within limits and that all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while incorporating all the required moral terms.
