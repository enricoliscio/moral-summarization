Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about their limited interactions despite being in the same city. Bloomberg is portrayed as a generous philanthropist, while Trump is described as flinty in his giving and more ostentatious. They belong to different circles but have had some cordial meetings, like playing golf together and Bloomberg appearing on Trump's TV show.

The moral framing seems to highlight their contrasting characters and values. Bloomberg is seen as a responsible, community-focused leader, while Trump is portrayed as more self-serving and volatile. Their interactions were cordial but distant, and their relationship soured when Bloomberg opposed Trump's candidacy, especially when Bloomberg considered running against him.

I need to make sure the summary captures these contrasts and the shift in their relationship. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

Let me structure it: start with their limited interactions, describe their contrasting profiles, mention their occasional meetings, then move on to their political rivalry, and conclude with the breakdown of their relationship.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, but ensure the moral undertones are clear. Make sure to include key points like their philanthropic differences, their business backgrounds, and their political opposition.

Also, I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to make sure it's necessary and contributes to the overall summary without unnecessary details.

Alright, time to put it all together concisely.
