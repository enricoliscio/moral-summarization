Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's relationship. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by talking about Bloomberg's speech at the DNC where he criticized Trump, calling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. It contrasts their backgrounds: Bloomberg as a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, while Trump is more ostentatious and into real estate and reality TV.

They don't interact much, but there are a few instances where they've met. They played golf together in 2007, and Bloomberg was on Trump's TV show twice. Their daughters are friends. Trump even tweeted positive things about Bloomberg when he was mayor.

But things changed when Trump announced his candidacy. Bloomberg explored running for president as an independent to block Trump, but later decided not to, fearing his third-party bid might help Trump. Trump, in turn, criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business.

So, the summary should capture their contrasting backgrounds, limited interactions, and the shift in their relationship when Trump ran for president. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

Let me structure it: start with their differing backgrounds, mention their limited interactions, then the change when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg's actions against him. Also, include Trump's counterattacks.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point, just hit the key events and their implications. Make sure to mention the golf meeting, the TV show appearances, the daughters' friendship, and the political moves that strained their relationship.

I think that's the main gist. Now, I'll put it all together in a concise summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all the important aspects without being too lengthy.
