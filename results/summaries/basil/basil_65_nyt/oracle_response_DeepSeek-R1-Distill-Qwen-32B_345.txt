Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used, specifically using the words: menace, sane, run, help, known, job, crazy. I have to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about how Bloomberg criticized Trump during the DNC, calling him a public menace and suggesting he's not sane. Despite their limited interactions in New York, they've had some cordial meetings, like golfing and TV appearances. However, their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg considered running against him as an independent to block Trump.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Bloomberg labels Trump as a menace and questions his sanity. Trump, in turn, criticizes Bloomberg's wealth and business. Their interactions were cordial but distant, with different philanthropic and business styles.

I should structure the summary to include these moral words. Start with Bloomberg's DNC speech, mention the labels, then their past interactions, and the shift when Trump ran for office. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

I'll make sure to include all the specified words: menace, sane, run, help, known, job, crazy. Maybe use "help" when talking about Bloomberg's desire to block Trump. "Known" can describe their reputations. "Job" could refer to Bloomberg's role as mayor or Trump's business ventures. "Crazy" is used by Bloomberg's advisor.

Putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that flows naturally, incorporating these words to maintain the moral framing.
