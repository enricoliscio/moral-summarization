SUMMARY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist, labeled Donald J. Trump a "public menace" and hinted that he was not quite sane in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. Despite their cordial interactions in the past, Bloomberg's words reveal a deep moral divide between the two billionaires. Bloomberg, a supporter of the arts, aligns himself with Manhattan's sophisticated cultural scene, whereas Trump relishes in being crude. Their differences extend to their business practices, with Bloomberg making his billions in finance and technology, and Trump getting his start in real estate and becoming a casino magnate and reality-show celebrity. The cordiality between them dissipated when Trump declared his candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid to block Trump from being elected. Trump, known for his counterattacks, has not shied away from criticizing Bloomberg, but the latter's words suggest that Trump's behavior is "crazy" and cannot be fixed. END OF SUMMARY.
