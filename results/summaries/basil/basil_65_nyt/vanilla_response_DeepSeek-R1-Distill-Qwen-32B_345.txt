Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about their relationship, starting with Bloomberg's speech at the Democratic Convention where he criticized Trump. It mentions that despite both being billionaires in NYC, their interactions were limited but cordial. They belong to different social circles: Bloomberg is a philanthropist and supports the arts, while Trump is more ostentatious and involved in real estate and TV.

They did meet a few times, like playing golf together in 2007 and Bloomberg appearing on Trump's TV show. Trump even complimented Bloomberg on Twitter when he was mayor. However, their relationship soured when Trump announced his candidacy. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump and later supported Clinton.

I should structure the summary to cover these points: their contrasting backgrounds, limited interactions, cordial meetings, and the breakdown of their relationship due to politics. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

Let me outline the key points:

1. Bloomberg's criticism of Trump at the DNC.
2. Their different social circles and backgrounds.
3. Occasional cordial meetings (golf, TV show).
4. Trump's compliments towards Bloomberg when he was mayor.
5. The breakdown of their relationship when Trump ran for president.
6. Bloomberg's efforts to block Trump, including a potential independent run.

Now, I'll condense these points into a coherent summary, making sure to include all important details without exceeding the word limit.
