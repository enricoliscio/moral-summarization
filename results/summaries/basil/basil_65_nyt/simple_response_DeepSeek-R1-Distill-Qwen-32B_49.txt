Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's relationship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It starts by highlighting Bloomberg's criticism of Trump at the DNC, calling him a public menace and suggesting he's not sane. This sets a negative moral tone towards Trump. 

Then, the article explains that despite their wealth, their interactions have been limited but cordial. It contrasts their personalities: Bloomberg as a philanthropist and cultural supporter, Trump as crude and ostentatious. This contrast adds to the moral framing, positioning Bloomberg more positively.

The article mentions specific instances where they met, like golf events and TV shows, showing that they weren't enemies before. However, the cordiality ended when Trump declared his candidacy. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump, showing his opposition.

I need to make sure the summary captures this shift from cordial to adversarial, emphasizing their differing characters and the political motivations behind their conflict. Also, include Trump's counterattacks, which adds to the tension.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: their limited interactions, the moral contrast, the political shift, and the resulting adversarial relationship. I'll structure it to show how their relationship deteriorated as Trump entered politics, highlighting the moral judgment against Trump.

Finally, I'll end with the summary token and ensure it's concise and within the word limit.
