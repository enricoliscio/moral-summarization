SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's relationship has evolved from limited yet cordial interactions within New York's ultrarich circles to a public display of rage and condemnation. Bloomberg, in his DNC speech, labeled Trump a menace and questioned his sanity, reflecting on their contrasting personalities and lifestyles. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, differs from Trump's crude and ostentatious image. Their paths crossed occasionally on golf courses and TV appearances, with Bloomberg supporting Trump's reality show, "The Apprentice." Their relationship was further connected through their daughters' friendship. However, the cordiality faded as Trump entered the presidential race, with Bloomberg exploring an independent bid to block Trump, ultimately deciding against it to avoid helping Trump win. Trump responded with skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and business, claiming their friendship was over. This highlights the moral framing of the article, depicting Bloomberg's moral outrage and the contrasting moral reputations of the two billionaires.
