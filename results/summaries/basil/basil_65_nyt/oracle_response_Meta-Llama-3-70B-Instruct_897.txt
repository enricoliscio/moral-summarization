SUMMARY:

Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City, despite their vastly different backgrounds and values. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, has made his fortune in finance and technology, whereas Trump, known for being crude and flashy, built his empire in real estate and reality TV. The two have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg has since labeled Trump a "public menace" and questioned his sanity, while Trump has retaliated with skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerabilities. The contrast between the two billionaires' values and behavior is stark, with Bloomberg embodying a sense of responsibility and Trump exemplifying recklessness.
