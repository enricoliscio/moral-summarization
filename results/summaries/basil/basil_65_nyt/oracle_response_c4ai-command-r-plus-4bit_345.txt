SUMMARY: Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump have had limited yet cordial interactions over the years despite their differing circles within New York's ultrarich community. Their paths have crossed on golf courses and TV sets, with Bloomberg even appearing on Trump's show "The Apprentice." Their daughters are also friends. However, their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, with Bloomberg exploring his own independent bid to block Trump's candidacy. Bloomberg ultimately decided against running, fearing he would siphon votes from Hillary Clinton and inadvertently help Trump win. Trump has since counterattacked, with their friendship seemingly dissolved.

END OF SUMMARY.
