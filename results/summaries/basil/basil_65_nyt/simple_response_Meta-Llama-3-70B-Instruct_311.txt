SUMMARY:

Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, both billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City's elite circles. Despite their differences, they have shown respect for each other in the past. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, has made his fortune in finance and technology, whereas Trump, known for his crudeness, made his start in real estate and later became a reality TV celebrity. The two have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, and Bloomberg has appeared on Trump's reality TV show. Trump has even praised Bloomberg's mayoral work on Twitter. However, their cordiality ended when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg's adviser, Kevin Sheekey, described Trump as "crazy" and someone who cannot be fixed. The two billionaires have since become bitter opponents, with Trump even questioning Bloomberg's net worth and business vulnerabilities.
