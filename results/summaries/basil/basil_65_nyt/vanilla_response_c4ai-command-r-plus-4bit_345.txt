SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump have had limited interactions over the years despite their similar backgrounds as wealthy New York businessmen. While their paths have crossed at times, they move in different circles and have different styles and interests. Bloomberg criticized Trump in his speech at the Democratic National Convention, calling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. Despite this, their interactions have been cordial in the past, with Bloomberg appearing on Trump's show "The Apprentice" and the two playing golf together. They also have a filial connection through their daughters, who are friends. However, their relationship has soured since Trump's presidential candidacy, with Bloomberg exploring his own run as an independent to block Trump and Trump counterattacking by criticizing Bloomberg's business.
END OF SUMMARY.
