SUMMARY:
Michael R. Bloomberg's rage-filled speech against Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention portrayed Trump as a public menace and questioned his sanity. This contrast with their limited yet cordial interactions in the past, where Bloomberg, known for his generosity and sophistication, and Trump, with his crude and ostentatious nature, moved in different circles of New York's ultrarich. Bloomberg's criticism hints at underlying tensions between the two billionaires, despite their occasional golf games and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's show "The Apprentice." Their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, with Bloomberg exploring an independent bid to block Trump's candidacy. Trump responded with skepticism and counterattacks, marking the end of their friendship.
