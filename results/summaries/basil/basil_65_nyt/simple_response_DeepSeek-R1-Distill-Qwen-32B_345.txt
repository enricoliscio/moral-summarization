Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's relationship. They want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, first, I need to understand what the moral framing is here. The article contrasts their personalities and actions, highlighting Bloomberg as a philanthropist and Trump as more self-centered. 

I should start by identifying the key points: their limited but cordial interactions, their different backgrounds and values, the shift in their relationship after Trump's candidacy, and the personal attacks they made. I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without going into too much detail.

Also, the user specified that the summary should be under 200 words and formatted with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. I'll have to keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary fluff.

I should structure it by first introducing their contrasting profiles, then their interactions, the turning point with Trump's candidacy, and the resulting animosity. Including specific examples like the golf event and TV appearances will help illustrate their cordiality before the split. Then, mention how their relationship soured as Bloomberg opposed Trump's presidency, leading to public disagreements.

I need to ensure the moral aspects are clear—Bloomberg's generosity versus Trump's self-promotion, their differing approaches to wealth and public service. The summary should reflect the underlying tension and their clashing values.

Finally, I'll make sure to stay within the word limit, probably around 150-200 words, and format it correctly as per the instructions. Let me draft that now, keeping it clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, despite being billionaires in New York City, have had limited but cordial interactions, existing in different social and professional circles. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, contrasts with Trump, who is more ostentatious and crass. Their paths crossed occasionally, such as on golf courses and in charity events, with Trump once showing deference to Bloomberg. Bloomberg even appeared on Trump’s reality TV show, and their daughters are friends. However, their relationship soured after Trump announced his candidacy, with Bloomberg opposing him and eventually exploring an independent presidential bid to block his election. Trump, in turn, criticized Bloomberg’s wealth and business practices. The once-cordial relationship dissolved into public animosity, reflecting their differing values and political goals. END OF SUMMARY.
