SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City, despite their vastly different backgrounds and values. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist, has supported the arts and aligned himself with Manhattan's sophisticated cultural scene, whereas Trump is known for being crude and flaunting his possessions. Their paths crossed on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump from being elected. Bloomberg eventually ruled out running, citing concerns that his third-party candidacy would help Trump, whom he labeled a "public menace" and hinted was not quite "sane". Trump retaliated, voicing skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and company vulnerability. The two are no longer friends, with Bloomberg warning that Trump's presidency would be a disaster, saying "God help us". END OF SUMMARY.
