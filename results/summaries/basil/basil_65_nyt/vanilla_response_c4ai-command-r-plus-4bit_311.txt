SUMMARY: Despite their differing paths in New York City's ultrarich circles, Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump had limited yet cordial interactions before Trump's presidential candidacy. They played golf together and Bloomberg appeared on Trump's show, "The Apprentice." Bloomberg's daughter Georgina is also friends with Trump's daughter Ivanka. Their relationship turned sour during Trump's campaign, with Bloomberg exploring his own presidential bid to block Trump. Trump later expressed skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and business in a CNN interview, claiming they were no longer friends.
END OF SUMMARY.
