SUMMARY:

Michael R. Bloomberg's scathing speech about Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention may have suggested a long-standing feud between the two billionaires. However, their interactions in New York City have been limited and cordial. They moved in different circles, with Bloomberg known for his philanthropy and support of the arts, while Trump was seen as crude and flashy. Despite their differences, they did meet on a few occasions, including a charity golf event and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show. Trump even praised Bloomberg on Twitter during his mayoral term. However, their cordiality ended when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg ultimately ruled out running, fearing his third-party candidacy would inadvertently help Trump. The two billionaires now have a bitter divide, with Trump even questioning Bloomberg's net worth and business vulnerabilities.

END OF SUMMARY.
