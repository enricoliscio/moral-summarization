Alright, I need to summarize the given article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Michael Bloomberg's speech at the DNC where he criticized Trump, calling him a public menace. It then contrasts their backgrounds and interactions. They don't interact much despite being in the same city, but they do have some encounters, like golfing and TV appearances. Bloomberg supported Trump's show, and Trump had positive tweets about Bloomberg. But after Trump ran for president, their relationship soured. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Trump, and Trump criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll highlight their contrasting backgrounds, limited interactions, the shift in their relationship post-Trump's candidacy, and Bloomberg's criticism at the DNC.

I should make sure to mention their different philanthropic styles, business backgrounds, and the turning point when Bloomberg opposed Trump. Also, include Trump's counterattacks on Bloomberg's wealth and business.

Let me structure it: Start with Bloomberg's DNC speech, contrast their backgrounds, mention their interactions, the change after Trump's candidacy, and conclude with the current strained relationship.

SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg criticized Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, calling him a public menace. Despite their billionaire status, their interactions in New York City have been limited yet cordial. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and arts supporter, contrasts with Trump, who is more ostentatious and cruder. They occasionally met on golf courses and in TV appearances, with Trump once praising Bloomberg on Twitter. However, their relationship soured after Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy. Bloomberg explored an independent bid to block Trump and later opposed his election, citing Trump's instability. Trump, in turn, criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business practices, signaling the end of their cordiality. END OF SUMMARY.
