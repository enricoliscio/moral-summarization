Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Michael Bloomberg's criticism of Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention. The author used specific morally charged words like "menace," "sane," "run," "help," "known," "job," and "crazy." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Bloomberg criticizes Trump, calling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. They have a history of limited but cordial interactions in New York City. Bloomberg is a philanthropist, while Trump is more ostentatious. They've met on golf courses and in TV shows, but their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, leading Bloomberg to consider a third-party bid to block Trump.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Bloomberg's criticism, using the words "menace" and "sane." Then, I'll note their limited interactions and the contrast between their personas. I'll include their meetings on golf courses and TV appearances, using "job" when mentioning Bloomberg's role on "The Apprentice." Finally, I'll explain how their cordiality ended when Trump ran, leading Bloomberg to consider a bid against him, using "crazy" as per the author's framing.

I should ensure the summary flows naturally and includes all the required moral words without making it sound forced. Let me piece it together, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg criticized Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, calling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. Despite their limited interactions in New York City, their paths occasionally crossed, such as on golf courses and in charity events. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, contrasts sharply with Trump, who is known for his ostentatious lifestyle and crude behavior. They have met on golf courses, including a 2007 charity event, and Bloomberg appeared on Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice," in 2004 and 2008. Their cordiality dissolved after Trump declared his candidacy, with Bloomberg exploring a presidential bid to block Trump. Bloomberg ultimately ruled out running, citing concerns that a third-party candidacy might help Trump win. Trump, in turn, criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business, stating, "I guess weâ€™re not friends anymore." END OF SUMMARY.
