SUMMARY:

Despite Michael R. Bloomberg's scathing criticism of Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, the two billionaires have had limited but cordial interactions in the past. They moved in different social circles in New York City, with Bloomberg known for his philanthropy and support of the arts, while Trump was seen as crude and flashy. The two have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007 and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show "The Apprentice." Trump even praised Bloomberg on Twitter during his mayoral tenure. However, their cordiality ended when Trump declared his presidential candidacy and Bloomberg explored a possible independent bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg ultimately decided not to run, fearing his candidacy would help Trump win. The two have since traded barbs, with Trump questioning Bloomberg's net worth and Bloomberg labeling Trump a "public menace."

END OF SUMMARY.
