SUMMARY:

The article highlights the contrasting personalities and values of Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires who have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, is portrayed as a sophisticated and humble individual, whereas Trump is depicted as crude, ostentatious, and flinty in his giving. Despite their differences, they have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election. The article suggests that Bloomberg's criticism of Trump at the Democratic National Convention is rooted in his genuine concern about Trump's fitness for office.
