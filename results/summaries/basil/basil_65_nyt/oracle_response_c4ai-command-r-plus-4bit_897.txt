SUMMARY: Despite their limited interactions over the years, former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump's relationship has soured as their political aspirations have clashed. In his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Bloomberg labeled Trump a public menace and questioned his sanity, highlighting their contrasting personas and paths to wealth. While Bloomberg is known for his philanthropy and alignment with the sophisticated cultural scene, Trump has embraced crudeness and ostentatious displays of wealth. Their cordial relationship, which included golf outings and appearances on Trump's TV show, has deteriorated since Trump's presidential candidacy. Bloomberg even considered running as an independent to block Trump's election, citing concerns about Trump's character and competence. Trump has since retaliated, criticizing Bloomberg's business and downplaying their past friendship. This narrative underscores the moral dimensions of their rivalry, with Bloomberg positioning himself as a sane and capable alternative to the menacing Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
