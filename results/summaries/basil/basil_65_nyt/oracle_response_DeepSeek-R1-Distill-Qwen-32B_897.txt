Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user specified that the summary should include as many of those words as possible and be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Bloomberg criticized Donald Trump at the DNC, calling him a public menace and questioning his sanity. Despite their different backgrounds and wealth, they had limited but cordial interactions in New York. Bloomberg is a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, while Trump is more ostentatious and involved in real estate and media. They met on golf courses and in TV shows, and their daughters are friends. However, their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg considered running against him, believing Trump was too crazy to be president. Trump responded by criticizing Bloomberg's wealth and business.

Now, I need to identify the moral framing words: menace, sane, run, help, known, job, crazy. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with Bloomberg calling Trump a menace and questioning his sanity. Mention their limited interactions despite being wealthy. Highlight their different traits: Bloomberg as a philanthropist, Trump as ostentatious. Include their meetings on golf courses and TV shows, and their daughters' friendship. Then, explain how their cordiality ended when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg's attempt to block him, thinking Trump was crazy. Finally, mention Trump's counterattacks.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral words are included. I'll draft the summary, making sure each point flows logically and the moral terms are appropriately placed.
