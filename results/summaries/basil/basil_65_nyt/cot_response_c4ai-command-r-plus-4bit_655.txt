SUMMARY:
Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's interactions in New York City have been limited yet cordial. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, and Trump, a flinty real estate mogul and casino magnate-turned-reality-show celebrity, moved in different circles of the city's ultrarich. Despite their differences, they played golf together and appeared on Trump's show, *The Apprentice*. Bloomberg even considered running for president as an independent to block Trump's candidacy, citing Trump's "crazy" behavior. Their cordiality dissipated after Trump declared his candidacy, and Trump has since launched counterattacks, expressing skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and business. This shift in their relationship demonstrates how even limited positive interactions can dissipate in the face of political differences and personal attacks.
