SUMMARY:
Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist, has been a supporter of the arts and has aligned himself with Manhattan's sophisticated cultural scene. Trump, on the other hand, has been flinty in his giving and relishes in being crude. Despite their differences, they have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg has since labeled Trump a "public menace" and hinted that he is not "sane." Trump has retaliated, voicing skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and speculating about the vulnerability of his company. END OF SUMMARY.
