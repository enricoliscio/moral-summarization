SUMMARY: There was once a cordial relationship between Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires from different circles of New York's ultrarich. Mr. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist known for his support of the arts and sophisticated demeanor, and Mr. Trump, who relishes in crudeness and showing off his wealth, had limited yet amicable interactions. Mr. Bloomberg even appeared on Mr. Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice," and their daughters are friends. However, the 2016 presidential election drove a wedge between them. Mr. Bloomberg considered running as an independent to block Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump responded with counterattacks, even questioning their former friendship. Mr. Bloomberg's adviser, Kevin Sheekey, underscores the extent of their rift: "You can't fix crazy." This moral framing highlights the contrast between the two men and their approaches to wealth, politics, and public life.
