SUMMARY:

Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaires, have had limited but cordial interactions in New York City, despite their vastly different backgrounds and values. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist and supporter of the arts, has made his billions in finance and technology, whereas Trump, known for being flinty in his giving, got his start in real estate and became a casino magnate and reality-show celebrity. The two have met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump's election, labeling him a "public menace" and hinting that he was not quite "sane". Trump has since counterattacked, voicing skepticism about Bloomberg's wealth and company. The two are no longer friends, with Bloomberg's adviser saying "you can't fix crazy".

END OF SUMMARY.
