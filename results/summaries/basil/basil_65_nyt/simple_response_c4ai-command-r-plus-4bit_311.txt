SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's interactions have been limited yet cordial, despite their differing personalities and circles within New York's ultrarich community. While Bloomberg is known for his philanthropy and association with the city's cultural scene, Trump has a reputation for being less charitable and more crass. Their paths have crossed on golf courses and TV sets, with Bloomberg even appearing on Trump's show "The Apprentice." Their daughters are also friends. However, the relationship soured when Trump ran for president, leading Bloomberg to explore his own independent candidacy to block Trump. Trump, in turn, has publicly questioned Bloomberg's wealth and the stability of his company. Their once-cordial relationship has now seemingly dissolved, with Trump declaring that they are "not friends anymore."
END OF SUMMARY.
