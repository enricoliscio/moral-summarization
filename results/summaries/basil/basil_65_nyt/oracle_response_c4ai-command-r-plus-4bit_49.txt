SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump have had limited but cordial interactions over the years, despite their differing personalities and circles within New York's ultrarich community. While Bloomberg is known for his philanthropy and alignment with the city's cultural scene, Trump has a reputation for being less charitable and more crude. Their paths have crossed on golf courses and when Bloomberg appeared on Trump's TV show, "The Apprentice." Their relationship has since soured since Trump's presidential candidacy, with Bloomberg even exploring his own independent bid to block Trump from being elected. In his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Bloomberg labeled Trump a public menace and questioned his sanity, highlighting the rift that has developed between the two billionaires. Trump, meanwhile, has publicly questioned Bloomberg's wealth and the strength of his company. Their relationship, once seemingly friendly, has now taken on a more antagonistic tone.
END OF SUMMARY.
