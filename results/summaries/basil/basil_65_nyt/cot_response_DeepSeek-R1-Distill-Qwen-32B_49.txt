Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Let me go through the text carefully.

The article talks about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. Words like "menace," "sane," "generous," "flinty," "crude," "sophisticated," "ostentatious," "show off," "cordial," "peacemaker," "deference," "great," "crazy," "siphon," "vulnerable," "friends." These words seem to carry moral judgments.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. I should mention their limited interactions, their contrasting traits, and how their relationship changed when Trump ran for president. Also, include how Trump attacked Bloomberg's wealth and business.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the moral framing. I'll structure it to show their differences, their cordial meetings, and the eventual breakdown of their relationship due to political ambitions.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring I include all key points and the morally framed words. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Wait, I should make sure each sentence flows logically and covers all necessary points without being too verbose. I'll also ensure that the moral framing is evident in the summary, reflecting the author's perspective on their relationship and its implications.

Michael Bloomberg criticized Donald Trump as a "public menace" and questioned his sanity during his speech at the Democratic National Convention. Despite their limited interactions, their relationship was cordial, with occasional meetings on golf courses and Mr. Trump even praising Mr. Bloomberg’s mayoral work. However, their relationship deteriorated after Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, as Mr. Bloomberg explored a presidential bid to block him. Mr. Bloomberg’s advisor called Trump “crazy,” while Trump countered by questioning Bloomberg’s wealth and business vulnerabilities. Their once cordial relationship dissolved, with Trump stating, “We used to be friends. I guess we’re not friends anymore.”
