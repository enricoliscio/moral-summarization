SUMMARY:

Despite Michael R. Bloomberg's harsh criticism of Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, the two billionaires have had limited but cordial interactions in the past. They moved in different circles in New York City, with Bloomberg known for his philanthropy and support of the arts, while Trump was seen as crude and flashy. They met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007 and Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show "The Apprentice". Trump even praised Bloomberg on Twitter during his mayoral term. However, their cordiality ended when Trump declared his presidential candidacy and Bloomberg explored a possible independent bid to block Trump's election. Bloomberg ultimately ruled out running, fearing his candidacy would help Trump. Trump has since made counterattacks, questioning Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerability.

END OF SUMMARY.
