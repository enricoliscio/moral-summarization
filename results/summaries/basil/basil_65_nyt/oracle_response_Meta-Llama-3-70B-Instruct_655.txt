SUMMARY:

Despite Michael R. Bloomberg's scathing criticism of Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, labeling him a "public menace" and hinting that he's not quite "sane", their interactions in New York City have been limited but cordial. They moved in different circles, with Bloomberg known for his philanthropy and support of the arts, while Trump was flinty in his giving and relished in being crude. The two billionaires met on a few occasions, including a charity golf event in 2007, where Trump showed deference to Bloomberg. Bloomberg even appeared on Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice", twice. However, their cordiality dissipated when Trump declared his presidential candidacy, and Bloomberg began exploring his own bid to block Trump from being elected. Bloomberg's adviser, Kevin Sheekey, described Trump as "crazy", saying "you can't fix crazy". Trump, in turn, has made counterattacks, questioning Bloomberg's wealth and business vulnerability. The two are no longer friends, with Trump saying "we used to be friends... I guess we're not friends anymore."

END OF SUMMARY.
