Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. They also specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems to talk about their relationship over the years, their interactions, and how it changed, especially with Trump's candidacy.

I notice that Bloomberg and Trump have known each other but weren't close. They've met on golf courses and even appeared on each other's TV shows. Bloomberg supported Trump's show, and Trump praised Bloomberg when he was mayor. But their relationship soured when Trump ran for president, and Bloomberg considered running against him.

I should highlight their differences in philanthropy, business, and public personas. Also, mention their limited but cordial interactions and how it changed when Trump became a candidate. Bloomberg even considered running as an independent to block Trump.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, covering their backgrounds, interactions, and the shift in their relationship. I'll structure it to first introduce their contrasting profiles, then their limited interactions, and finally the political rivalry that developed.

I should avoid going into too much detail about each event but focus on the key points. Also, ensure it's under 200 words and properly formatted with the start and end tokens.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Michael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump, two billionaire figures in New York City, have had limited but cordial interactions over the years, despite their stark differences. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and supporter of the arts, contrasts with Trump, known for his ostentatious lifestyle and real estate ventures. Their paths crossed occasionally on golf courses and in media appearances, including Bloomberg's appearances on Trump's reality TV show "The Apprentice." Trump even praised Bloomberg during his mayoral tenure. However, their relationship soured when Trump declared his presidential candidacy in 2015. Bloomberg, initially exploring an independent presidential bid to block Trump, ultimately decided not to run, citing concerns about splitting the anti-Trump vote. Trump, in turn, criticized Bloomberg's wealth and business practices. Their once-cordial relationship dissolved as political rivals. END OF SUMMARY.
