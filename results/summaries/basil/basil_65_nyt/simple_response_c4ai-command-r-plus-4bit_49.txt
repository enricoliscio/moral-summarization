SUMMARY: Despite their limited interactions over the years, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump's relationship has shifted from cordial to contentious. While the two billionaires have different circles and personalities, they have crossed paths in the past, including on the golf course and when Bloomberg appeared on Trump's show, "The Apprentice." Bloomberg's recent scathing speech at the Democratic National Convention, where he labeled Trump a public menace, reflects the growing rift between them. Trump, who once praised Bloomberg's mayorship and business acumen, has since turned to criticism, questioning Bloomberg's wealth and the stability of his company. This deterioration of their relationship underscores the increasingly polarized political climate and the personal nature of their disputes. END OF SUMMARY.
