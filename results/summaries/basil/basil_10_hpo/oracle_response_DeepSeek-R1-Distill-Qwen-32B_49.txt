Okay, so I need to help this user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on the second day of their rule. They're emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as a way to reduce the federal government. They're making it a requirement for new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. 

The author uses words like "enact," "institute," "controversial," "contentious," "spending," "cut," and "trim." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

The article mentions that this is a first in the House's history, which ties into the Tea Party influence. It also discusses the cost of reading the Constitution, about $1.1 million, and the spending cuts they plan, saving $35 million. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the key points: the reading of the Constitution, the new rule requiring constitutional authority statements, the cost, and the spending cuts. I need to keep it under 200 words and include the moral words.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the main action: House reading the Constitution. Then mention the new rule and its purpose. Include the cost and the spending cuts. Also, note the symbolic vs practical impact and the criticism about the cost. End with the quotes from Boehner and Bachmann to emphasize their commitment.

I should ensure that each moral word is appropriately placed. For example, "enact" when talking about legislation, "institute" for the new rules, "controversial" and "contentious" when discussing the statements, and "spending," "cut," "trim" for the budget measures.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points concisely. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House read the Constitution in full for the first time in its 221-year history, symbolizing a commitment to strict adherence to the founding document. Republicans aim to "enact" legislation with a "constitutional authority statement" for each new bill, a move seen as part of the "tea party-ization" of Congress. While the symbolic gesture is significant, its practical impact remains unclear, as most legislation already undergoes constitutional review. Critics argue that "constitutional authority statements" may be "controversial" and "contentious," given differing interpretations of the Constitution. The cost of the reading is estimated at $1.1 million, drawing criticism for "reckless spending." Republicans also plan to "trim" spending by 5% across leadership, member, and committee budgets, saving $35 million over nine months. Speaker John Boehner emphasized the oath to the Constitution, while Rep. Michele Bachmann highlighted the GOP's renewed commitment to it. END OF SUMMARY.
