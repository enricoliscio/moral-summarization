SUMMARY:

In a symbolic move, the House of Representatives, now under Republican rule, read the Constitution aloud on the second day of their term. This move is seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government and adhere to the Constitution. Republicans have also made it a requirement for lawmakers to cite the constitutional authority behind their proposed legislation. While some see this as a positive step towards respecting the Constitution, others argue that it may not have a significant impact, as lawmakers already swear to abide by the Constitution and legislation is vetted for constitutional support before reaching the floor. The move is estimated to cost $1.1 million. Republicans argue that this move shows their commitment to the Constitution and reducing reckless spending, as demanded by voters.
