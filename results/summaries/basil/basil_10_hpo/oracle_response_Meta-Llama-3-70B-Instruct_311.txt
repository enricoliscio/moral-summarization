SUMMARY:

On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a move seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government and "return to its founding principles." The reading, a first in the chamber's 221-year history, is a symbolic gesture towards the tea party movement's demand for strict adherence to the Constitution. The House GOP will now require lawmakers to include a statement citing the constitutional authority for proposed legislation, a move aimed at respecting the Constitution. However, critics argue that this new rule may have little practical impact, as most legislation is already vetted for constitutional support. The estimated cost of this symbolic gesture is $1.1 million. Meanwhile, the House is set to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months. The move is seen as a step towards ending "reckless spending" and respecting the Constitution.
