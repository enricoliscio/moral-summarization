SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives, now under Republican rule, has read the Constitution in full, a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move is part of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and adhere to the Constitution. A new rule will require lawmakers to include a statement citing the constitutional authority for proposed legislation. The reading of the Constitution is seen as a symbolic victory for the Tea Party movement, which has been pushing for a return to founding principles. However, it is unclear what practical impact this new rule will have, as lawmakers already swear to abide by the Constitution and legislation is vetted for constitutional support before reaching the floor. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. The House is also set to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5% trim in office budgets, which is expected to save $35 million over nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
