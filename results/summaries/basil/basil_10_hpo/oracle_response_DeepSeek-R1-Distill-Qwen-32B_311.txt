Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific words to include. First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the context. It's about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution, making it a requirement for new bills to cite constitutional authority, and discussing the costs and criticisms.

The key morally framed words are: enact, institute, controversial, contentious, spending, cut, trim. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. I'll start by identifying the main points: the reading of the Constitution, the new rule about citing authority, the costs involved, and the reactions from Boehner and Bachmann.

I should structure the summary to include each of these points, using the specified words. For example, "institute" can be used when talking about the new rule. "Enact" might come in when discussing the legislation. The costs and spending cuts can be tied to "spending," "cut," and "trim." Also, the criticism about the rule being controversial and contentious should be mentioned.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including all the required moral terms. Let me draft a version that hits all these points without being too wordy. I'll check to ensure each key term is present and that the moral framing is preserved as the author intended.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution in full, marking a symbolic gesture tied to the tea party movement's emphasis on returning to founding principles. Republicans aim to **institute** a rule requiring all new bills to include a "Constitutional Authority Statement," citing the constitutional basis for proposed legislation. Critics argue this move may be **controversial** and **contentious**, as constitutional interpretations vary widely. The estimated cost of the reading ceremony is $1.1 million, drawing criticism for **spending** during a time of budget cuts. The House also plans to **trim** its budget by 5%, saving $35 million over nine months. Speaker John Boehner emphasized the GOP's commitment to the Constitution, while Rep. Michele Bachmann praised the move as a response to voter demands for **renewed** fiscal responsibility. The new rules reflect a broader effort to **enact** policies aligned with constitutional principles, though their practical impact remains uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
