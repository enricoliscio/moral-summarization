SUMMARY:
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This "tea party-ization of Congress" is a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and ensure strict adherence to the Constitution. The new rule requires lawmakers to cite the constitutional authority for proposed legislation, a pillar of the grass-roots movement. While the impact of this rule is unclear, it symbolizes the GOP's commitment to respecting the Constitution and ending "reckless spending." The House also plans to cut spending, with a proposed 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million. This renewed commitment to the Constitution is a key aspect of the GOP's agenda.
