SUMMARY:
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a "tea party-ization of Congress" that marks a shift towards strict adherence to the founding document. The reading is a symbolic gesture, but it's a significant one, as it reflects the GOP's commitment to reducing the size of the federal government. The new rule requires lawmakers to cite the constitutional authority behind their proposed legislation, a move that Rep. Michele Bachmann says shows Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution. While some argue that the impact of this rule may be limited, it's a step towards a renewed commitment to the nation's governing document. The House also plans to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5 percent trim in office budgets, which is expected to save $35 million over nine months. END OF SUMMARY.
