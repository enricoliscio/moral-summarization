Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the Republican-controlled House of Representatives starting their term by reading the Constitution. 

First, the key details: it's the second day of Republican rule, they're reading the Constitution, which is a first in the House's history. They're emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as a way to reduce the federal government. They've made it a requirement for new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. 

The article also mentions the cost, about $1.1 million, which some find excessive. There are different opinions on whether this will have a real impact since legislation is already vetted for constitutionality. The Tea Party is applauding this move, and there are mentions of specific representatives like John Boehner and Michele Bachmann supporting it. Additionally, they're cutting spending by 5%, saving $35 million.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main actions: reading the Constitution, the new rule about citing authority, the cost, and the spending cut. Also, include the symbolic vs practical impact debate and the Tea Party's role.

I should structure it to first mention the reading, then the new rule, the cost, the spending cut, and the opinions on the significance. Make sure it's concise and captures all essential points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule in the House, members read the U.S. Constitution in full, a symbolic gesture marking a first in the chamber's history. Republicans have made strict adherence to the Constitution a cornerstone of their agenda to reduce federal government size. They plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority for the legislation. The move, seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement, has been criticized for its potential cost, estimated at $1.1 million, and questioned for its practical impact, as most legislation already undergoes constitutional review. While the gesture is largely symbolic, it reflects a broader commitment to returning to founding principles. Additionally, the House is set to approve a 5% spending cut, saving $35 million over nine months. END OF SUMMARY.
