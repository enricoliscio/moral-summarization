SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican control of the House, lawmakers read the US Constitution in full, marking what is believed to be a first in the chamber's 221-year history. The move underscores the Republican Party's commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution as a guiding principle for reducing the size of the federal government. The reading cost an estimated $1.1 million and is part of a broader set of new rules instituted by the GOP-led House, including a requirement for all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. The move has been applauded by Tea Party activists, who have long advocated for a return to the country's founding principles. However, the impact of this rule change is uncertain, given that most legislation is already vetted for constitutional support. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut measure, expected to save $35 million over nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
