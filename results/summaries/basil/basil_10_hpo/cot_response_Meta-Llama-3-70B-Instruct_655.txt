SUMMARY:
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a historic first in the chamber's 221-year history. This "tea party-ization of Congress" is a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and ensure strict adherence to the Constitution. The new rule requires lawmakers to include a statement citing the constitutional authority for proposed legislation, a pillar of the tea party movement. While some question the impact of this symbolic gesture, Republicans argue it demonstrates their commitment to respecting the Constitution. The move is part of a broader effort to curb "reckless spending" and restore a renewed commitment to the nation's founding principles. The House also plans to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months. END OF SUMMARY.
