SUMMARY:
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a historic first in the chamber's 221-year history. This "tea party-ization of Congress" is a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and promote strict adherence to the Constitution. Republicans will require lawmakers to cite the constitutional authority for new bills, a move seen as a renewed commitment to the founding document. The reading of the Constitution is seen as a symbolic gesture, but it marks a significant shift towards respecting the Constitution. Critics argue that the move may not have a significant impact, but Republicans see it as a step towards ending "reckless spending" and promoting a more serious approach to governance. The House also plans to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months. END OF SUMMARY.
