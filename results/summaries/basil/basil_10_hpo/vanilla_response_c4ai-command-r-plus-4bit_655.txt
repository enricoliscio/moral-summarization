SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule in the House, the Constitution was read aloud, marking a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move symbolizes the GOP's commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution and reducing the size of the federal government. The reading cost approximately $1.1 million, with the House GOP requiring all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority. The impact of this new rule is unclear, as most legislation is already vetted for constitutional support. Republicans also plan to cut spending by 5% in leadership, member, and committee office budgets, saving an estimated $35 million over nine months. This action aligns with their pledge to end reckless spending and uphold the Constitution.

END OF SUMMARY.
