SUMMARY: Republicans have made their allegiance to the Constitution clear as they took control of the House. On Thursday, volunteers read the entire document on the House floor, marking what is believed to be a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This display of reverence for the nation's founding document is a key tenet of the Republican and Tea Party movement's effort to reduce the size and spending of the federal government. The new House Speaker, John Boehner, and prominent Tea Party figure, Rep. Michele Bachmann, have both emphasized the importance of upholding the Constitution and ending reckless spending. To that end, the House will now require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority for the proposed legislation. While the impact of this rule remains to be seen, it sends a powerful message about the GOP's commitment to fiscal responsibility and limited government. The estimated cost of reading the Constitution on the House floor underscores the challenge of controlling costs, but the GOP's first spending cut measure aims to trim budgets and save $35 million over nine months. This commitment to constitutional principles and fiscal restraint marks a new era in Congress and a victory for the Tea Party movement. END OF SUMMARY.
