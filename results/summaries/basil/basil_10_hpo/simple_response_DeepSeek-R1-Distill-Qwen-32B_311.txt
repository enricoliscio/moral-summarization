Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on the second day of their rule. They're emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as a way to reduce the federal government's size. They're making it a requirement for all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. This is a first in the House's history, and it's seen as a move influenced by the Tea Party movement.

The Washington Post and Politics Daily provide some context. The reading is symbolic but might not have a significant impact because most legislation is already vetted for constitutionality. The cost of reading the Constitution is estimated at over a million dollars, which some find wasteful. Boehner and Bachmann are quoted, highlighting their commitment to the Constitution and cutting spending.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the reading of the Constitution, the new requirement for bills, the historical significance, the symbolic vs practical impact, the cost, and the quotes from Boehner and Bachmann. I should keep the moral framing, which seems to be about returning to founding principles and fiscal responsibility.

Let me structure this: start with the event, mention the new rule, note the historical first, discuss the symbolic aspect and potential lack of impact, add the cost, and conclude with the quotes emphasizing their commitment.

I need to ensure the summary is concise and captures all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House read the Constitution in full for the first time in its history, symbolizing a renewed commitment to constitutional principles. Republicans aim to reduce federal government size and have made strict adherence to the Constitution a cornerstone of their agenda. They plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority, a move seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement. While the symbolic act has been praised, its practical impact is questioned, as most legislation already undergoes constitutional vetting. The estimated cost of $1.1 million for the reading has drawn criticism for wasteful spending. Speaker John Boehner emphasized the oath to the Constitution, while Rep. Michele Bachmann highlighted the shift toward fiscal responsibility and constitutional respect. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut, expected to save $35 million. END OF SUMMARY.
