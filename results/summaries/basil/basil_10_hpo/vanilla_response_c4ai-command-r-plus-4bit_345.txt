SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican control of the House, members read the US Constitution aloud, marking a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move underscores the GOP's commitment to strict interpretation of the Constitution as a cornerstone of their agenda to reduce federal government overreach. The reading cost an estimated $1.1 million and is part of a broader set of new rules instituted by the Republican majority, including a requirement for all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the legislation. The move has been applauded by Tea Party activists, who have long advocated for a return to the country's founding principles. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut measure, expected to save $35 million over nine months. The actions reflect the GOP's response to voter demands for curbing reckless spending and reinforcing constitutional principles.
END OF SUMMARY.
