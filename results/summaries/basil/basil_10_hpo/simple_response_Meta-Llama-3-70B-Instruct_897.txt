SUMMARY:

In a symbolic move, the House of Representatives read the Constitution in full, a first in its 221-year history, as Republicans took control. This gesture is part of the GOP's effort to reduce the federal government's size and adhere to the Constitution. New rules will require lawmakers to include a statement citing the constitutional authority for proposed legislation. While some see this as a victory for the Tea Party movement, others argue that the impact will be limited, as lawmakers already swear to abide by the Constitution and legislation is vetted for constitutional support. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. Republicans claim this move shows their commitment to respecting the Constitution and reducing reckless spending. The House also plans to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5% trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
