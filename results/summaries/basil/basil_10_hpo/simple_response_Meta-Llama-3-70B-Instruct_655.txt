SUMMARY:

In a symbolic gesture, the House of Representatives read the Constitution aloud on the second day of Republican rule, emphasizing the party's commitment to adhering to the nation's founding document. As part of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government, Republicans will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority behind the proposed legislation. This move is seen as a victory for the Tea Party movement, which has long advocated for a return to the Constitution's principles. However, critics argue that the impact of this new rule is unclear, as lawmakers already swear to abide by the Constitution and legislation is vetted for constitutional support before reaching the House floor. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. The move is seen as a step towards fiscal responsibility, with the House also set to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months.
