SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives, under Republican rule, has taken a significant step towards adhering to the Constitution by reading it aloud on the second day of their tenure. This move is seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government. Moreover, they have made it a requirement for all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. This move is seen as a victory for the Tea Party movement, which has been demanding that Washington return to its founding principles. However, the impact of this new rule is unclear, as virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway. Additionally, the estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. The House is also set to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices, which is expected to save $35 million over the next nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
