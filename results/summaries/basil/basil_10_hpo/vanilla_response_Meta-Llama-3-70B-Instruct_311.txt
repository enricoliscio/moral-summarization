SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has read the Constitution in full, a first in its 221-year history, as part of the Republican effort to reduce the size of the federal government. This move is seen as a key tenet of the Tea Party movement, which emphasizes strict adherence to the Constitution. As part of this effort, Republicans will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. While the impact of this new rule is unclear, it is seen as a symbolic gesture towards a more constitutionally-bound government. The reading of the Constitution is estimated to have cost around $1.1 million. Additionally, the House is set to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5% trim in office budgets, which is expected to save $35 million over the next nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
