SUMMARY: In a move to showcase their commitment to reducing the size of the federal government and adhering to the Constitution, Republicans in the House read the governing document in full for the first time in the chamber's 221-year history. This act symbolized the influence of the Tea Party movement on the Republican Party and their shared desire to return to the founding principles of the nation. The estimated cost of this display was $1.1 million. 

The new House Speaker, John Boehner, and Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), a prominent voice in the Tea Party movement, emphasized the importance of respecting the Constitution and ending reckless spending. The House GOP will require that all new bills include a citation of the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. While the impact of this new rule is unclear, it underscores the GOP's commitment to institutionalizing their interpretation of constitutional principles. 

Also, on the second day of Republican rule, the House took up its first spending cut measure, proposing a 5 percent trim in leadership and member office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months. This action further highlights the party's focus on fiscal responsibility and their interpretation of the Constitution. 

END OF SUMMARY.
