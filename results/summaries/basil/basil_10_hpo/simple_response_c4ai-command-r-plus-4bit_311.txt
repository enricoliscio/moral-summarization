SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives have demonstrated their commitment to upholding the Constitution by reading it aloud in its entirety, marking a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This act symbolizes the GOP's dedication to reducing the size of the federal government and adhering strictly to the nation's founding document. Accompanying this gesture is a proposed requirement for all new bills to include a citation of constitutional authority. While the impact of this rule remains uncertain, it underscores the tea party's influence in Congress and their demand for a return to fundamental principles. The estimated cost of the GOP's plans to read the Constitution on the House floor is $1.1 million, reflecting the value they place on honoring and upholding the nation's governing principles. This commitment is further emphasized by Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann, who view the reading as a response to voters' calls for responsible spending and constitutional fidelity. The House also plans to cut spending by 5%, saving an estimated $35 million over nine months. These actions showcase the GOP's dedication to their moral duty of respecting the Constitution and the will of the people.
END OF SUMMARY.
