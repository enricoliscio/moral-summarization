Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on the second day of their rule. They're emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as part of reducing the federal government's size. They plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. This seems to be a first in the House's history, which is 221 years old. 

The article mentions that this move is part of the Tea Party influence in Congress. They've been handing out pocket Constitutions and studying it article by article. Now, their efforts are leading to a new rule in the House. However, some argue that this might not have a significant impact because Congress already follows legal precedents and lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution. Also, the Constitution's interpretations are often debated, so these statements might be controversial.

There's also a cost involved, around $1.1 million, which includes salaries, expenses, and other overhead while the House is in session but not working. Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann are quoted, emphasizing the importance of the Constitution and the spending cuts they're proposing, which include a 5% budget trim to save $35 million over nine months.

So, the main points are: the House reading the Constitution, the new rule requiring constitutional authority statements, the cost of this initiative, and the proposed spending cuts. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should make sure to include the key elements: the event, the new rule, the historical significance, the cost, and the quotes from Boehner and Bachmann about their commitment to the Constitution and spending cuts. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the event, then the new rule, followed by the cost and quotes, and end with the spending cuts.

Republicans plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority, a first in the House's 221-year history.
