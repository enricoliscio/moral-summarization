Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified certain morally framed words that should be included. Let me start by understanding the key points of the article.

The article talks about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on their second day in power. They're emphasizing strict adherence to it as a way to reduce the federal government's size. They plan to make all new bills include a statement citing constitutional authority. This is a first in the House's history and is seen as a move influenced by the Tea Party.

The article also mentions the estimated cost of this reading, $1.1 million, which some might see as wasteful spending. There's a focus on spending cuts, with a proposed 5% trim in budgets, expected to save $35 million. The Republicans, including Speaker Boehner and Rep. Bachmann, are highlighting their commitment to the Constitution and reducing spending.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the words: enact, institute, controversial, contentious, spending, cut, trim. I need to make sure these words are preserved in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the reading of the Constitution, the new rule requiring constitutional authority statements, the cost, the spending cuts, and the reactions from Boehner and Bachmann.

I should structure the summary to include the key actions (enact, institute) and the implications (controversial, contentious). Also, mention the spending cut and trim, highlighting the cost aspect.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me draft it, ensuring all the morally framed words are included naturally.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House read the Constitution in full, a symbolic move to emphasize strict adherence to the founding document. Republicans aim to reduce the federal government's size and have instituted a new rule requiring lawmakers to include a "constitutional authority statement" with all new bills. This move, seen as a first in the House's history, reflects the Tea Party's influence on Congress. Critics argue the rule may be controversial and contentious, as constitutional interpretations often vary. The estimated cost of reading the Constitution on the House floor is $1.1 million, sparking debate over spending priorities. Additionally, the House plans to trim spending by cutting budgets for leadership, members, and committees by 5%, saving $35 million over nine months. Republicans, including Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann, emphasize their commitment to enacting policies that respect the Constitution and reduce reckless spending. END OF SUMMARY.
