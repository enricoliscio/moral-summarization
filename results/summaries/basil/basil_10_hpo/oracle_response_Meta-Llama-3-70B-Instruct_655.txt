SUMMARY:

On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a move seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government and respect the nation's governing document. The House GOP will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation, a move that may be seen as contentious and controversial. This new rule is part of a broader effort to institute strict adherence to the Constitution, a pillar of the tea party movement. However, critics argue that the impact of this rule may be limited, as congressional action is already presumed valid and lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution when taking their oaths of office. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. Additionally, the House is set to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in office budgets, which is expected to save $35 million over nine months.
