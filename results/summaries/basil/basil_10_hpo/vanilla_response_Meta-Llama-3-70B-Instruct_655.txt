SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has read the Constitution in full, a first in its 221-year history, as part of the Republican effort to reduce the size of the federal government. The reading is a key tenet of the GOP's commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution. Additionally, the House GOP will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. This move is seen as a victory for the Tea Party movement, which has long advocated for a return to the nation's founding principles. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. The House is also set to take up its first spending cut measure, a 5% trim in office budgets, which is expected to save $35 million over the next nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
