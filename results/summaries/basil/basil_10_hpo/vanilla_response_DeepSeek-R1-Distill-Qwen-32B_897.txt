Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on their second day in power. They're emphasizing strict adherence to it as a key part of reducing the federal government. They'll require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. This seems like a first in the House's history, according to The Washington Post, which calls it the "tea party-ization of Congress." Tea party activists are applauding this move.

Politics Daily mentions that while this has symbolic value, the actual impact might be unclear. They note that most congressional actions are already presumed constitutional, and bills are vetted by lawyers. Also, the Constitution's interpretation is often debated, so these statements might be controversial.

There's a cost involved too, about $1.1 million, as per Vanity Fair. Boehner and Bachmann are quoted, emphasizing their commitment to the Constitution and cutting spending. The House is also considering a 5% budget cut, saving around $35 million.

So, the main points are: Constitution reading as a new rule, the requirement for constitutional authority statements, the symbolic vs. practical impact, the cost, and the spending cuts. I should condense these into a concise summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House of Representatives read the Constitution in full, a symbolic move marking a first in the chamber's history. Republicans, influenced by the Tea Party movement, aim to enforce strict adherence to the Constitution, requiring all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. While this move has symbolic significance, its practical impact is unclear, as most legislation is already vetted for constitutionality. The cost of the reading is estimated at $1.1 million. Additionally, the House plans a 5% budget cut for leadership and committees, expected to save $35 million. New Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann highlighted the GOP's commitment to the Constitution and fiscal responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
