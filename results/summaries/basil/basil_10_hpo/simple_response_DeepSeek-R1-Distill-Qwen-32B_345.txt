Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on the second day of their rule. They made it a requirement for new bills to include a constitutional authority statement. It's noted as a first in the House's history. The Tea Party influence is highlighted, and there's criticism about the cost and practicality of the move. Some argue it's symbolic without real impact, while others see it as a commitment to the Constitution.

I need to capture the key elements: the reading of the Constitution, the new rule about constitutional authority, the historical significance, the Tea Party's role, the criticism regarding cost and effectiveness, and the context of reduced spending.

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to reflect both the Republican's stance and the critics' perspectives. Also, mention the $1.1 million cost and the spending cut proposal.

Let me start drafting, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House of Representatives read the Constitution in full for the first time in its 221-year history, symbolizing a commitment to strict constitutional adherence. Republicans, influenced by the Tea Party movement, have introduced a rule requiring all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority, aiming to reduce federal government size. Critics argue the move is symbolic, as most legislation already undergoes constitutional review, and the cost of $1.1 million has drawn criticism for being wasteful. Despite this, newly elected Speaker John Boehner emphasized the importance of the Constitution, stating that lawmakers' primary oath is to it. The House also proposed a 5% budget cut for leadership and committees, expected to save $35 million. The move reflects a broader push to return to founding principles, though its practical impact remains unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
