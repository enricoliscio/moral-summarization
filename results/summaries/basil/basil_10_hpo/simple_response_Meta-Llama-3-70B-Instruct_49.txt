SUMMARY:

The Republican-led House of Representatives has taken a significant step towards adhering to the Constitution by reading it aloud on the House floor, a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move is seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government and return to the nation's founding principles. Additionally, the House GOP will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. While some argue that this move may not have a significant practical impact, it is seen as a symbolic victory for the Tea Party movement, which has long advocated for a return to constitutional principles. The move is also seen as a commitment to fiscal responsibility, with the House set to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over the next nine months.
