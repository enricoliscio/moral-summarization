SUMMARY: In a move to emphasize their commitment to adhering to the Constitution, Republicans in the House of Representatives read the governing document in full, a first in the chamber's history. This act symbolizes the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and their dedication to strict adherence to the Constitution. The new rule will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the legislation. While the impact of this rule is uncertain, it underscores the GOP's seriousness about respecting the Constitution and ending reckless spending. The estimated cost of reading the Constitution on the House floor is $1.1 million. Additionally, the House plans to cut spending by 5% in leadership, member, and committee office budgets, saving an estimated $35 million. These actions demonstrate the Republicans' dedication to their constitutional values and fiscal responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
