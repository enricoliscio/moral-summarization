SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives, now under Republican rule, has read the Constitution in full, a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move is part of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and ensure strict adherence to the Constitution. A new rule requires lawmakers to include a statement citing the constitutional authority for proposed legislation. While the move is seen as symbolic, its practical impact is unclear, as lawmakers already swear to abide by the Constitution and legislation is vetted for constitutional support. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. Republicans also plan to cut spending, with a proposed 5% trim in office budgets expected to save $35 million over nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
