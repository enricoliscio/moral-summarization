SUMMARY: Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and made a dramatic reading of the US Constitution, marking the first time in the chamber's 221-year history that the founding document was read in full. This act symbolizes the GOP's commitment to reducing the size of the federal government and strictly adhering to the Constitution. The new House rules, influenced by the Tea Party movement, include a requirement for all new bills to cite the constitutional authority for their enactment. While the impact of this rule is uncertain, it underscores the GOP's focus on respecting the Constitution and ending reckless spending. The estimated cost of the Constitution reading was $1.1 million. The House also plans to cut spending by 5 percent in leadership, member, and committee office budgets, with expected savings of $35 million over nine months. These actions demonstrate the Republicans' dedication to their campaign promises and their interpretation of the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
