Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about Republicans reading the Constitution and implementing new rules. The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words and then write a concise summary using those words.

Okay, starting with step one, I need to go through the article and pick out the words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "reduce," "strict adherence," "tea party-ization," "applaud," "pillar," "symbolic power," "impact," "presumed valid," "oath," "swear," "Constitutional Authority Statements," "controversial," "contentious," "reckless spending," "renewed commitment," "respect," "serious," "save," "trim," and "frivolous spending." These words seem to carry the moral weight the author intended.

Now, moving on to the summary. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and includes as many of those moral words as possible. The article talks about the Republicans reading the Constitution, making it a requirement to cite constitutional authority for new bills, the cost involved, and the spending cuts. I should highlight the moral aspects like reducing government size, strict adherence, the Tea Party influence, the cost concerns, and the commitment to the Constitution.

I should structure the summary to first mention the reading of the Constitution, then the new rules, the cost, and the spending cuts. Make sure to include the moral words to preserve the framing. Also, mention the criticism about the cost and the symbolic versus practical impact. Finally, tie it all together by showing the Republican commitment to their principles.

Let me draft that. Start with the reading, mention the requirement for constitutional authority, the cost, the spending cuts, the criticism, and conclude with their commitment. I need to keep it concise but cover all key points with the moral language intact.

I think that covers everything. Now, just need to put it all together smoothly, making sure it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

**SUMMARY:**  
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, emphasizing strict adherence to it as a key tenet of their effort to reduce federal government size. Republicans plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority, a move seen as a pillar of the Tea Party movement. While the symbolic power of this action is clear, its practical impact is uncertain, as most legislation is already vetted for constitutional support. Critics, including Peter Keating, estimate the cost of reading the Constitution on the House floor at $1.1 million, questioning the value of the exercise. Newly minted Speaker John Boehner emphasized that lawmakers swear an oath to the Constitution, not to constituents. Rep. Michele Bachmann highlighted the renewed commitment to the Constitution, calling it a response to voters' demand for an end to reckless spending. The House also proposed a 5% budget trim, aiming to save $35 million over nine months. While the move is symbolic, it reflects Republicans' serious effort to respect the Constitution and reduce frivolous spending. END OF SUMMARY.
