SUMMARY:
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a historic first in the chamber's 221-year history. This "tea party-ization of Congress" is a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and ensure strict adherence to the Constitution. The new rule requires lawmakers to cite the constitutional authority for proposed legislation, a move seen as a pillar of the grass-roots tea party movement. While some question the impact of this symbolic gesture, Republicans argue it shows their commitment to respecting the Constitution and ending "reckless spending". The House also plans to cut spending by 5% in leadership and committee offices, estimated to save $35 million over nine months. END OF SUMMARY.
