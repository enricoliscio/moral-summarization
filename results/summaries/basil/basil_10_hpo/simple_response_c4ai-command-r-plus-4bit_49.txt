SUMMARY: In a symbolic gesture, Republicans in the House read the US Constitution in its entirety, emphasizing their commitment to strict interpretation and limited government. This act carries moral weight as it signals a return to the founding principles of the nation and a response to the demands of the Tea Party movement, which has advocated for reduced federal power. The move is intended to demonstrate respect for the Constitution and to curb reckless spending. The estimated cost of this gesture is $1.1 million, highlighting the potential disconnect between symbolic acts and fiscal responsibility. This act of constitutional reverence sets the tone for the new House GOP majority and their commitment to uphold the values they deem fundamental to the nation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
