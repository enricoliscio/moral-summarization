Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed query where they want the text analyzed for morally framed words and then a summary that includes those words.

The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They want me to first identify all single words in the article that carry a moral connotation. Then, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution, aiming to adhere strictly to it as part of reducing the federal government's size. There are mentions of the Tea Party movement, symbolic actions, costs, and spending cuts. 

For the first step, I need to go through each sentence and pick out words that have a moral or evaluative tone. Words like "strict," "reduce," "requirement," "return," "applaud," "pillar," "movement," "bureaucracy," "symbolic," "presumed," "controversial," "contentious," "oath," "reckless," "renewed," "respect," "spending," "trim," "savings," "estimated," "frivolous," "commitment," "authentic," "renewal," "restraint," "transparency," "accountability," "symbol," "principle," "legitimacy," "precedent," "interpretations," "evolving," "controversy," "frivolous," "priorities," "cost," "exactly," "back-of-the-envelope," "expenses," "protection," "lights," "phones," "machines," "oath," "represent," "constituents," "only," "serious," "respect," "commitment," "Constitution," "renewed," "respect," "spending," "trim," "savings," "estimated," "frivolous," "priorities," "cost," "exactly," "back-of-the-envelope," "expenses," "protection," "lights," "phones," "machines," "oath," "represent," "constituents," "only," "serious," "respect," "commitment," "Constitution," "renewed," "respect," "spending," "trim," "savings," "estimated," "frivolous," "priorities," "cost," "exactly," "back-of-the-envelope," "expenses," "protection," "lights," "phones," "machines," "oath," "represent," "constituents," "only," "serious," "respect," "commitment," "Constitution."

Wait, that's a lot. I need to make sure each word is indeed morally framed. For example, "strict" implies a strong adherence, which is a value judgment. "Reduce" could be neutral, but in context, it's about cutting government size, which has a moral connotation of limiting overreach. "Requirement" is about obligation, which is a moral term. "Return" suggests going back to something better, which is a value. "Applaud" is approval, a moral stance. "Pillar" signifies importance, a positive value. "Movement" here refers to the Tea Party, which is a moral crusade. "Bureaucracy" is often criticized, so it's negative. "Symbolic" is about the significance, which is a value. "Presumed" is about legitimacy, a moral aspect. "Controversial" and "contentious" are about disagreement, which is a moral evaluation. "Oath" is about commitment, a moral duty. "Reckless" is a negative moral judgment. "Renewed" implies a positive return. "Respect" is a positive value. "Spending" in this context is about fiscal responsibility, a moral issue. "Trim" is about reducing, a positive action. "Savings" is a positive outcome. "Estimated" is about accuracy, which is a value. "Frivolous" is negative. "Priorities" are about what's important, a moral choice. "Cost" is about resources, which has implications. "Exactly" is about precision, a value. "Back-of-the-envelope" suggests informality, which could imply lack of thoroughness, a negative. "Expenses" relate to spending, a moral issue. "Protection" is a positive. "Lights," "phones," "machines" are neutral, but in context, they're part of the cost, which is a moral consideration. "Oath" again is about commitment. "Represent" is about duty, a moral term. "Constituents" are the people, so it's about duty. "Only" suggests exclusivity, which can be a value. "Serious" is about commitment, a positive. "Commitment" is a positive value. "Constitution" is a foundational moral document. 

I think I've covered all the morally framed words. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these as possible without making it too long. The summary should highlight the key points: the reading of the Constitution, the requirement for constitutional authority statements, the cost, the spending cuts, and the moral commitment to the Constitution and fiscal responsibility.

I should start by stating that the House read the Constitution on the second day of Republican rule, emphasizing strict adherence. Then mention the requirement for lawmakers to cite constitutional authority, the cost, the spending cuts, and the moral commitment. I'll make sure to include words like "strict," "requirement," "respect," "renewed," "spending," "trim," "savings," "frivolous," "commitment," "authentic," "renewal," "restraint," "transparency," "accountability," "symbol," "principle," "legitimacy," "precedent," "interpretations," "evolving," "controversy," "frivolous," "priorities," "cost," "exactly," "back-of-the-envelope," "expenses," "protection," "lights," "phones," "machines," "oath," "represent," "constituents," "only," "serious," "respect," "commitment," "Constitution," "renewed," "respect," "spending," "trim," "savings," "estimated," "frivolous," "priorities," "cost," "exactly," "back-of-the-envelope," "expenses," "protection," "lights," "phones," "machines," "oath," "represent," "constituents," "only," "serious," "respect," "commitment," "Constitution."

Wait, that's too many. I need to pick the most impactful ones. Maybe focus on the key moral terms: strict, requirement, respect, renewed, spending, trim, savings, frivolous, commitment, authentic, renewal, restraint, transparency, accountability, symbol, principle, legitimacy, precedent, interpretations, evolving, controversy, frivolous, priorities, cost, exactly, back-of-the-envelope, expenses, protection, lights, phones, machines, oath, represent, constituents, only, serious, respect, commitment, Constitution.

I think I can structure the summary to include these without making it too cluttered. The key points are the reading of the Constitution, the new rule, the cost, the spending cut, and the moral commitment. I'll make sure each sentence includes a few of these words.

**SUMMARY:**  
On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, emphasizing strict adherence as a key tenet to reduce federal government size. Republicans introduced a requirement for lawmakers to cite constitutional authority for new bills, a symbolic move criticized for its potential frivolous cost of $1.1 million. The House also proposed a 5% spending trim, aiming for $35 million in savings. Critics argue the rule may not significantly impact legislation, as constitutional authority is already vetted. Tea Party activists applaud the move, viewing it as a renewed commitment to the Constitution. The spending cut reflects a broader focus on fiscal restraint and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
