SUMMARY: Republicans have made strict adherence to the Constitution a key tenet of their effort to reduce the federal government's size. The House GOP plans to make it a requirement that all new bills include a statement citing the Constitutional authority. Reading the Constitution in full is reportedly a first in the chamber's history and serves as a pillar of the grass-roots movement. The impact of this new rule is unclear, as virtually all congressional action is initially presumed valid, and abiding by the Constitution is already sworn to in the oath of office. However, the text of the Constitution is susceptible to different and evolving views, which may render Constitutional Authority Statements controversial. The estimated cost of the GOP plans to read the document is $1.1 million. Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann emphasize the importance of abiding by the Constitution and respecting the voters' call for an end to reckless spending. The House also plans to take up its first spending cut measure, with Republicans estimating a savings of $35 million over nine months. END OF SUMMARY.
