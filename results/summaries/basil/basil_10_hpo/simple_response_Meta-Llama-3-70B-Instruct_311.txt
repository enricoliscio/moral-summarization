SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives, now under Republican rule, has taken a significant step towards upholding the Constitution by reading it aloud on the House floor. This move is seen as a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and adhere to the nation's founding principles. The new rule requires lawmakers to cite the constitutional authority behind their proposed legislation, a move that is seen as a victory for the Tea Party movement. While some argue that this move may not have a significant practical impact, it is a symbolic gesture towards accountability and respect for the Constitution. The estimated cost of this exercise is $1.1 million. Additionally, the House is set to take up its first spending cut measure, aiming to trim 5% from leadership, member, and committee offices, saving $35 million over nine months.
