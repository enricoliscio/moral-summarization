SUMMARY:

On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a move seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government. Republicans will make it a requirement for all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. This move is seen as a victory for the tea party movement, which has been demanding that Washington return to its founding principles. However, critics argue that the new rule may not have a significant impact, as congressional actions are presumed valid anyway, and lawmakers already swear to abide by the Constitution. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. Meanwhile, Republicans are also proposing a 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices, which they estimate will save $35 million over the next nine months. The move is seen as a step towards respecting the Constitution and cutting reckless spending.
