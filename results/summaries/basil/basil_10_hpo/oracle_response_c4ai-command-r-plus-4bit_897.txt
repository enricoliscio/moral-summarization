SUMMARY: In a symbolic gesture, Republicans read the US Constitution on the House floor, emphasizing their commitment to strict adherence to its principles and a reduction in the size of the federal government. This act of moral rectitude is estimated to have cost $1.1 million. The new House Speaker, John Boehner, justified this expense by explaining that lawmakers swear an oath to the Constitution, not their constituents. This enactment of the reading of the Constitution is a first in the chamber's 221-year history and is intended to demonstrate the GOP's dedication to respecting the nation's founding document. 

This commitment to constitutional principles is further emphasized by the GOP's plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. However, the impact of this new rule is uncertain, given the evolving interpretations of the Constitution and the presumption of validity for congressional actions. 

Also, on the second day of Republican rule, the House took up its first spending cut measure, proposing a 5 percent trim in leadership and member office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months. This move aligns with the GOP's promise to end reckless spending and reinforces their moral stance on fiscal responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
