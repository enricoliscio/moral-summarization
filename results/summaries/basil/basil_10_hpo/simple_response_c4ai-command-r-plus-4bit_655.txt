SUMMARY: In a symbolic gesture, Republicans in the House of Representatives read the United States Constitution in its entirety, including all 27 amendments, on the second day of their majority rule. This act underscores their commitment to reducing the size of the federal government and adhering strictly to the nation's founding document. The estimated cost of this exercise is $1.1 million, a price that some may argue is unnecessary given that lawmakers already swear to uphold the Constitution upon taking office. Nonetheless, the gesture carries symbolic power and showcases the GOP's dedication to constitutional principles. The reading is accompanied by a new requirement that all new bills include a statement citing the constitutional authority for the proposed legislation. This rule change reflects the influence of the Tea Party movement, which has long advocated for a return to the founding principles of the nation. While the impact of these changes remains to be seen, they send a clear message about the GOP's priorities and their commitment to fiscal responsibility and constitutional adherence.

END OF SUMMARY.
