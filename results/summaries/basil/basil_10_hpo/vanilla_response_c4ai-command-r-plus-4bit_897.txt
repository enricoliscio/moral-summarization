SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives marked the start of their new majority by reading aloud the US Constitution, a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move symbolized their commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution as a guiding principle for reducing the size of federal government. The estimated cost of this exercise was $1.1 million. The new rules also include a requirement for all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. The impact of this rule is uncertain, given that most legislation is already vetted for constitutional support. Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann, a prominent voice in the Tea Party movement, emphasized that these actions demonstrate the Republicans' dedication to respecting the Constitution and responding to voters' calls for an end to reckless spending. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut measure, expected to save $35 million over nine months. 

END OF SUMMARY.
