Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the second day of Republican rule in the House. They read the Constitution, which is a big deal because it's the first time in 221 years. The Republicans are emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as part of their plan to reduce the federal government. They're making it a rule that every new bill must include a statement citing constitutional authority. This is part of the Tea Party influence, as they've been pushing for a return to founding principles.

There's some criticism too. The cost is estimated at over a million dollars, which some see as wasteful spending. Others argue that since lawmakers already swear to uphold the Constitution and that most legislation is vetted legally, this new rule might not have a significant impact. It's more symbolic than practical, but it shows a commitment to constitutional principles.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements: the reading of the Constitution, the new rule about citing constitutional authority, the Tea Party influence, the criticism regarding cost and practicality, and the symbolic versus real impact. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the main event: the House reading the Constitution for the first time. Then mention the new rule requiring constitutional authority statements. Highlight the Tea Party's role. Then address the criticism about cost and the symbolic nature of the move. Finally, note the spending cut proposal as another action by the Republicans.

I should ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”Republicans are seen as committed to the Constitution and reducing government, while critics see it as costly symbolism. I need to balance both perspectives without bias.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and hits all the key points within the word limit.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House read the Constitution for the first time in its 221-year history, symbolizing a commitment to strict adherence as part of efforts to reduce federal government size. Republicans introduced a rule requiring all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority, a move influenced by the Tea Party movement advocating a return to founding principles. Critics argue the measure is symbolic, as most legislation already undergoes constitutional vetting, and the $1.1 million cost raises concerns about wasteful spending. Newly elected Speaker John Boehner emphasized the oath to the Constitution, while Rep. Michele Bachmann highlighted the renewed commitment to constitutional principles. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut, estimated to save $35 million, reflecting their focus on fiscal discipline and constitutional governance. END OF SUMMARY.
