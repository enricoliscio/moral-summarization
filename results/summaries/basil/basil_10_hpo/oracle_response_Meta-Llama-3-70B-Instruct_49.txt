SUMMARY:

On the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution, a move seen as a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government. Republicans will require lawmakers to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact proposed legislation. This move is seen as a fulfillment of the Tea Party's demand to return to the nation's founding principles. However, critics argue that this new rule may not have a significant impact, as congressional action is already presumed valid, and lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution when taking their oaths of office. Moreover, the Constitution is open to different interpretations, making "Constitutional Authority Statements" potentially controversial and contentious. The estimated cost of this move is $1.1 million. Meanwhile, Republicans are also set to institute a 5 percent trim in office budgets, estimated to save $35 million over nine months, as part of their effort to cut spending.
