SUMMARY: The House of Representatives recently read the Constitution in full for what is believed to be the first time in its 221-year history. This move by the Republicans is part of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government and ensure strict adherence to the Constitution. They plan to require that all new bills include a statement citing the constitutional authority for the proposed legislation. While some see this as a symbolic gesture, others question its practicality and point out the potential for controversy and contention in interpreting the Constitution. The estimated cost of reading the Constitution on the House floor is $1.1 million. Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann defended the move, stating that it demonstrates a commitment to the Constitution and an end to reckless spending. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut measure, expected to save $35 million over nine months. This action reflects the Republican's moral framing of their agenda as one of adherence to rules, commitment, and respect for the Constitution, as well as responsible spending.
END OF SUMMARY.
