Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on their second day in power. They're emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as part of their plan to reduce the federal government. 

They mentioned that this is a first in the House's 221-year history, so that's a key point. Also, they're requiring all new bills to have a statement citing constitutional authority. That's an important rule change.

The cost is about $1.1 million, which is a bit of a controversy. They're also cutting spending by 5%, saving $35 million. Tea Party influence is highlighted here, with Michele Bachmann and John Boehner making statements about respecting the Constitution.

I should include the symbolic nature of reading the Constitution and the practical aspects like the cost and spending cuts. Also, note that while it's symbolic, the impact might be unclear due to legal precedents and varying interpretations.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll start with the main event, mention the new rules, the cost, the spending cut, and the symbolic vs. practical aspects.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule in the House, members read the Constitution in full for the first time in the chamber's 221-year history. Republicans aim to strictly adhere to the Constitution as part of their effort to reduce federal government size. A new rule requires all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. The move, seen as symbolic, has drawn criticism for its estimated $1.1 million cost. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut, saving $35 million over nine months. Tea Party activists view this as a return to founding principles, though the practical impact of the new rules remains uncertain due to varying constitutional interpretations. END OF SUMMARY.
