SUMMARY:
In a symbolic move to emphasize their commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution, Republicans in the House read the governing document in full on the second day of their rule. This action underscores a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government by requiring all new bills to cite their constitutional authority. The estimated cost of this plan is nearly $1.1 million. The reading of the Constitution appears to be a first in the chamber's history and is being hailed as a victory by Tea Party activists, whose movement has emerged as a powerful force in Congress. While the impact of this rule change is uncertain, it underscores the GOP's serious commitment to respecting the Constitution and ending reckless spending. The House also took up its first spending cut measure, proposing a 5% trim in budgets to save $35 million over nine months. This move further highlights the Republicans' effort to reduce government spending and abide by the constitutional tenets they swore to uphold.
