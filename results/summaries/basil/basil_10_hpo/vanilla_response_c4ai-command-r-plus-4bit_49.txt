SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule in the House, volunteers read the US Constitution aloud, marking a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move underscores the Republicans' commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution as they aim to reduce the federal government's size. The reading cost an estimated $1.1 million and is part of a broader effort by Republicans to emphasize constitutional authority in legislation. The House GOP will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional basis for the proposed law. While the impact of this rule change is uncertain, it highlights the Tea Party's influence on the Republican agenda and their shared desire to return to the nation's founding principles. Additionally, the House plans to cut spending by 5%, saving an estimated $35 million over nine months. This action aligns with the Republican pledge to curb reckless spending. END OF SUMMARY.
