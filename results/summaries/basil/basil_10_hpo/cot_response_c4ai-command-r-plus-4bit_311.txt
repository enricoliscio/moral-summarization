SUMMARY: In a historic move, the Republican-led House read the Constitution aloud on the second day of their rule, emphasizing their commitment to strict adherence to the nation's governing document. This move symbolized the GOP's tenet to reduce the size of the federal government and reflected the influence of the Tea Party movement, which has long advocated for a return to constitutional principles. The reading cost approximately $1.1 million and was accompanied by plans to require all new bills to include a citation of constitutional authority. While some questioned the impact of this gesture, it underscored the Republican oath to respect the Constitution and end reckless spending. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut, estimated to save $35 million over nine months, demonstrating their seriousness about fiscal responsibility and abiding by the moral framework of the Constitution.
