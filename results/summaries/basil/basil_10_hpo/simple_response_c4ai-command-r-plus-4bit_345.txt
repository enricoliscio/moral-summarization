SUMMARY: In a symbolic gesture to tea party-backed Republicans, the Constitution was read aloud in the House of Representatives, marking a first in the chamber's 221-year history. The move underscores the GOP's commitment to strict adherence to the Constitution as a guiding principle for reducing the size and scope of the federal government. This commitment is further emphasized by plans to require all new bills to include a citation of constitutional authority. The estimated cost of reading the Constitution on the House floor is $1.1 million, highlighting the financial implications of congressional proceedings. Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Michele Bachmann, prominent voices in the Tea Party movement, framed the gesture as a response to voters' demands for fiscal responsibility and a return to constitutional principles. The House also proposed a 5% spending cut, projecting savings of $35 million over nine months, reflecting the GOP's focus on reducing government spending. This mix of symbolism and action demonstrates the Republican-led House's dedication to upholding the Constitution and controlling government spending.
END OF SUMMARY.
