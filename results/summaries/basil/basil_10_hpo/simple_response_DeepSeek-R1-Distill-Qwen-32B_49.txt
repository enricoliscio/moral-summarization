Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the second day of Republican rule in the House, where they read the Constitution. It mentions that this is a symbolic act, part of their effort to adhere strictly to the Constitution to reduce the federal government's size. They plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority. The Washington Post notes this is a first in the House's history and refers to it as the "tea party-ization of Congress."

There's also a mention that while this has symbolic power, the actual impact might be unclear because most congressional actions are already presumed valid, and legislation is vetted by lawyers. The Constitution's interpretation is subjective, so these statements could be controversial.

Additionally, the estimated cost of reading the Constitution is around $1.1 million, which some find excessive. The Republicans are also proposing spending cuts, like a 5% trim in leadership and committee budgets, expected to save $35 million.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The article highlights the symbolic nature of reading the Constitution, the Tea Party influence, and the potential cost concerns. The moral aspects include fidelity to the Constitution, the grassroots movement's influence, and the cost versus symbolic value.

I should make sure the summary includes these points without going over 200 words. I'll structure it to mention the reading, the requirement for constitutional authority statements, the historical significance, the symbolic vs. practical impact, the cost, and the spending cuts. I'll keep the language concise and preserve the moral elements as presented.

SUMMARY: On the second day of Republican rule, the U.S. House read the Constitution in full for the first time in its history, symbolizing a commitment to strict constitutional adherence and reducing federal government size. Republicans plan to require all new bills to include a statement citing constitutional authority, a move seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement. While the symbolic act has been praised, its practical impact is unclear, as most congressional actions are already presumed constitutional, and interpretations of the document often vary. The estimated cost of the reading is $1.1 million, drawing criticism for its expense. Additionally, the House is proposing a 5% spending cut across leadership and committee budgets, expected to save $35 million over nine months. The move reflects a renewed focus on constitutional principles and fiscal responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
