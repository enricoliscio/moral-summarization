SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives have made their strict adherence to the Constitution a key tenet of their agenda to reduce the size of federal government. On Thursday, volunteers read the seven articles and 27 amendments of the founding document aloud on the House floor, reportedly a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This symbolic gesture underscores the GOP's commitment to interpreting and enacting legislation within the boundaries set by the Constitution. The estimated cost of this exercise is $1.1 million. 

In addition to this public display, the House GOP plans to require that all new bills include a "Constitutional Authority Statement," citing the specific authority to enact the proposed legislation. While the impact of this new rule remains to be seen, it is part of a broader effort to respect the Constitution and reduce reckless spending. The House also plans to cut spending by trimming leadership and committee office budgets by 5%, resulting in an estimated savings of $35 million over nine months. These actions demonstrate the Republicans' seriousness about upholding their interpretation of the Constitution and reigning in federal spending. 

END OF SUMMARY.
