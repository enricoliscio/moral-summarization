Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about the Republican-controlled House reading the Constitution on the second day of their rule. They're emphasizing strict adherence to the Constitution as part of their effort to reduce the federal government's size. They plan to make lawmakers cite constitutional authority for new bills. This is a first in the House's history, symbolizing the Tea Party's influence.

The article mentions that while this is symbolic, the practical impact is unclear. It's noted that most legislation already goes through constitutional vetting, and the Constitution's interpretations vary. The cost is around $1.1 million, which some see as wasteful spending. Boehner and Bachmann are quoted, highlighting their commitment to the Constitution and spending cuts. The House also plans a 5% budget cut, saving $35 million.

I need to capture these points concisely, highlighting the moral aspects like commitment to the Constitution and fiscal responsibility. I should keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.
