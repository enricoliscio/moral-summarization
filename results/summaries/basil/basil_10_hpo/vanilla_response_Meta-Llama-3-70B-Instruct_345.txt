SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives, now under Republican rule, has read the Constitution aloud on the floor, a first in the chamber's 221-year history. This move is seen as a key tenet of the GOP's effort to reduce the size of the federal government and adhere to the Constitution. As part of this effort, Republicans will require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. The reading of the Constitution is seen as a symbolic victory for the Tea Party movement, which has long advocated for a return to the nation's founding principles. The estimated cost of reading the document on the House floor is $1.1 million. Additionally, the House is set to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in office budgets, which is expected to save $35 million over nine months.

END OF SUMMARY.
