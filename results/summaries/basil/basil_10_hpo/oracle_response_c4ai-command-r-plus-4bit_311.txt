SUMMARY: In a dramatic display of their commitment to reducing the size of the federal government and adhering to the Constitution, Republican lawmakers in the House read the governing document in its entirety on the second day of their rule. This act symbolized the tea party-ization of Congress and reflected the movement's demand for a return to Washington's founding principles. The estimated cost of the GOP's plans to read the Constitution on the House floor was $1.1 million. 

The House GOP will now require all new bills to include a statement citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. While the impact of this new rule remains to be seen, it underscores the Republican commitment to respecting the Constitution and ending reckless spending. 

On the same day, the House took up its first spending cut measure, proposing a 5 percent trim in leadership and member office budgets, expected to save $35 million over nine months. These actions by the Republicans send a strong message about their interpretation of their oath to the Constitution and their commitment to fiscal responsibility. 

END OF SUMMARY.
