Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. The article is about Donald Trump becoming the president. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that it's 584 days since Trump announced his candidacy. He took the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. That's a key point. The article then talks about his background as a real estate developer and reality TV star, which is interesting because it shows his unconventional path to the presidency.

Next, it mentions how he won the Republican nomination despite having 16 other candidates, many more experienced. This highlights his political outsider status. He capitalized on the primary voters' anger towards the GOP establishment for not fighting Obama's policies, which is a significant reason for his success in the primaries.

In the general election, he trailed Hillary Clinton most of the time. But the article points out two factors that helped him: the hacked Democratic emails and Comey's decision to reopen the email probe. These events probably swung the election in his favor.

He won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, which were states Clinton was expected to win. This narrow margin is important because it shows how close the election was despite the popular vote difference.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key events: the time since his announcement, the oath administered by Roberts, his background, winning the nomination, his primary base, the factors that helped him in the general election, and the states he won with the narrow margin.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all the main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the oath, then his background, the nomination, the primary support, the general election challenges, and the outcome.

I also need to remember to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." and keep it concise. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath, marking Trump's journey from a New York real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's leader. Trump secured the Republican nomination despite facing 16 other candidates, many with more political experience, by appealing to a primary base angered by the GOP establishment's handling of President Barack Obama's policies. In the general election, he trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but benefited from the release of hacked Democratic emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's email use. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, despite Clinton's expectation to secure those states. END OF SUMMARY.
