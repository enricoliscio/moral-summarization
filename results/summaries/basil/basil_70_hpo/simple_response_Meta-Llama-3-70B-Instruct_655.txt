SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's unlikely journey to the presidency culminated in his inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. Despite being a political outsider, Trump capitalized on the anger of the Republican base towards the establishment GOP for not fighting President Obama's policies aggressively enough. He won the nomination against 16 more experienced candidates and went on to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election, despite trailing her for most of the race. Trump's victory was aided by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. In the end, Trump won three crucial states - Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - by a margin of 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump's victory was a result of his ability to tap into the anger and frustration of the Republican base, and that the release of stolen emails and Comey's decision may have unfairly influenced the outcome of the election.

END OF SUMMARY.
