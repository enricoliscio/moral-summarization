SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, capping a surprising rise from reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by anger towards the Republican establishment and a series of events in the final months of the campaign, including the release of internal Democratic Party emails that were stolen by Russian hackers. Trump's win was unexpected, as he trailed Hillary Clinton for most of the general election and ultimately won key states by a narrow margin. His ascension to the presidency represents an unprecedented shift in American politics, with a political newcomer and outsider harnessing the power of an angry base to defeat more experienced and established candidates.
END OF SUMMARY.
