SUMMARY: 

Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. Trump's journey from a New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office was unlikely, as he won the Republican nomination against a crowded field of 16 other candidates, many of whom were far more experienced in politics. Trump capitalized on a primary voting base that was angry at the establishment GOP for not more aggressively fighting President Barack Obama's policies. In the final month of the race, he was helped by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers, as well as by FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen, briefly, the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, states that Clinton had counted on winning. 

END OF SUMMARY.
