Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article. The user is a news summarizer assistant, so I should make sure the summary is concise and within 200 words. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump's inauguration, his background, how he won the nomination, the factors that helped him win the election, and the results.

I should start by noting that Trump took the oath of office after 584 days since his announcement. Mentioning the Chief Justice administering the oath is important. Then, I'll include his background as a real estate developer and TV personality.

Next, I'll talk about his Republican nomination victory over 16 candidates, focusing on the primary voters' anger at the GOP establishment. Then, his general election win despite trailing Clinton, helped by hacked emails and Comey's action.

Finally, I'll summarize the key states he won and the narrow margin. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, starting with the main event and then the context.

I should avoid any markdown and ensure the summary is straightforward. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath, marking Trump's journey from a New York real estate developer and TV personality to the nation's leader. Trump secured the Republican nomination despite facing 16 other candidates, capitalizing on a primary base angered by the GOP establishment's handling of President Obama's policies. Though trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump benefited from leaked Democratic emails and FBI Director James Comey's reopened investigation into Clinton's email use. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations. END OF SUMMARY.
