Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that it's been 584 days since Trump announced his candidacy. He took the oath of office, becoming the 45th president. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath at noon. That's a key point.

It then talks about his journey from a real estate developer and reality TV star to president. That's an important background detail. He won the Republican nomination against 16 others, many more experienced. So, he came from behind in the primaries.

He capitalized on the primary voters' anger at the GOP establishment not fighting Obama's policies. That's a crucial factor in his nomination.

In the general election, he trailed Hillary Clinton most of the time. But in the final month, two things helped him: the hacked Democratic emails and Comey reopening the Clinton email probe. These events swung the election in his favor.

He won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, which were states Clinton expected to win. That's a significant detail.

So, the summary should include the key events: the time since his candidacy announcement, the oath administered by Roberts, his background, the primary victory, the reasons for his success, the factors in the general election, and the states he won narrowly.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points clearly.
