SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump took the oath of office on Friday to become the 45th President of the United States, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. Trump, a New York City real estate developer and reality TV star, won the Republican nomination despite being less experienced in politics than his 16 opponents. He capitalized on voter anger towards the establishment GOP and its failure to fight President Barack Obama's policies. Trump trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, but was helped by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, states Clinton had counted on winning. Trump's unlikely journey culminated in his inauguration as President.

END OF SUMMARY.
