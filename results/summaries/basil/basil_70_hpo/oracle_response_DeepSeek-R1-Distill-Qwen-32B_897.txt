Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing, especially focusing on the word "stolen." Let me read through the article again to understand the context. The article talks about Donald Trump becoming president, his background, and the factors that led to his victory, including the stolen emails and Comey's actions. 

First, I should identify the key points: Trump's journey from a real estate developer to president, his victory despite trailing Clinton, the stolen emails' role, and Comey's reopening of the investigation. The moral framing here is crucial, so I need to make sure to include "stolen" when referring to the emails. 

I should structure the summary to flow from Trump's announcement to his inauguration, mentioning his background, the primary and general election dynamics, and the factors that influenced the outcome. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it ends with the key moral point about the stolen emails and Comey's decision.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with Trump taking the oath, mention his background, his primary victory, the general election where he trailed, the stolen emails and Comey's action, and the narrow win in the key states. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects without adding any bias beyond what's in the article.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear and concise summary.

SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, marking the culmination of his improbable journey from a New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation’s highest office. Trump, who announced his candidacy 584 days prior, won the Republican nomination despite facing 16 other candidates, many with more political experience. His success was fueled by a primary base angered at the GOP establishment for not adequately opposing President Barack Obama’s policies. In the general election, Trump trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but ultimately secured victory by a narrow margin in key states. This was aided by the near-daily release of stolen Democratic Party emails, obtained by Russian hackers, and FBI Director James Comey’s decision to briefly reopen the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, defying Clinton’s expectations. END OF SUMMARY.
