SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, marking the end of his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by an angry primary voting base that felt the establishment GOP didn't aggressively fight President Barack Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was aided by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers, as well as FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump ultimately won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations. The outcome was shaped by controversial events, including the theft of emails, which contributed to Trump's surprise victory.

END OF SUMMARY.
