SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping a surprising and unlikely rise from reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by anger towards the establishment Republican Party and a series of events in the final months of the campaign, including the release of internal Democratic Party emails that were stolen by Russian hackers. Trump narrowly won the election by a margin of 78,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, states that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, had expected to win. This unexpected victory marked a significant shift in American politics and highlighted the power of tapping into voter dissatisfaction with the status quo. END OF SUMMARY.
