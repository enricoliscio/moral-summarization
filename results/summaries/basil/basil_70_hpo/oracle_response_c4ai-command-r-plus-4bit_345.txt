SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, capping a surprising and unlikely journey from reality TV star to the nation's highest office. His victory was made possible by tapping into the anger of primary voters towards the establishment GOP and their perceived lack of opposition to President Barack Obama's policies. Trump ultimately won the election with a narrow margin in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, despite trailing Hillary Clinton for most of the general election. His win was aided by the release of internal Democratic Party emails that were stolen by Russian hackers and the brief reopening of an investigation into Clinton's email server by FBI Director James Comey.
END OF SUMMARY.
