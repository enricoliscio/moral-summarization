SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's unlikely journey to the presidency culminated in his inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. Despite being a political outsider, Trump capitalized on the anger of the Republican base towards the establishment GOP, which had failed to effectively counter President Obama's policies. Trump's campaign was aided by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. These factors contributed to Trump's narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, securing his presidency. The outcome is a testament to the power of populist sentiment and the importance of accountability in politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
