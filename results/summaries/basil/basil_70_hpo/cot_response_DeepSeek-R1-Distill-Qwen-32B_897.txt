Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me read through the article again to pick those out.

The article talks about Donald Trump becoming president. Words like "unlikely journey" might imply that his path was unconventional, which could have a moral tone. "Angry" is definitely a moral word, showing frustration. "Capitalize" here means taking advantage, which could have a negative connotation. "Stolen" is clearly negative, indicating wrongdoing. "Helped" is positive in this context, as it contributed to his victory. "Reopen" could imply interference or unfairness. "Counted on" is neutral but might imply reliance, which could have a moral aspect if it's about expectations.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words and maintain the moral framing. I should mention Trump's journey, the anger in the GOP base, his capitalizing on that, the stolen emails, Comey's reopening, and Clinton's reliance on those states. I'll structure it to show the moral aspects, like the anger and the stolen information, which could imply wrongdoing or unfair advantage.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is concise. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump became the 45th U.S. president after an unlikely journey from a real estate developer and TV star to the White House. His victory capitalized on a GOP base angry at the establishment for not challenging President Obama's policies. Despite trailing Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump won key states by 78,000 votes, aided by stolen Democratic emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the email server probe. Clinton had counted on winning these states but fell short. END OF SUMMARY.
