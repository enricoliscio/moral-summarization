SUMMARY: After a contentious and unlikely journey, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, despite his lack of political experience and trailing behind his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for most of the general election. Trump capitalized on the anger of Republican primary voters towards the establishment GOP, and benefited from external factors such as the release of hacked Democratic Party emails and FBI investigations into Clinton. His victory in key states by a narrow margin showcases the power of an angry voting base and raises questions about the role of external influences in elections. Trump's ascendancy to the nation's highest office, marked by his unorthodox campaign, challenges the traditional norms of politics and sets a new precedent.
END OF SUMMARY.
