SUMMARY: Donald Trump's improbable journey to the presidency was capped on Friday as he took the oath of office, becoming the 45th president of the United States. Trump's victory, fueled by anti-establishment anger, came despite his lack of political experience and consistent trailing in the polls against Hillary Clinton. Ultimately, Trump's win was secured by a narrow margin in key states and external factors, including the release of internal Democratic Party emails that were stolen by Russian hackers.
END OF SUMMARY.
