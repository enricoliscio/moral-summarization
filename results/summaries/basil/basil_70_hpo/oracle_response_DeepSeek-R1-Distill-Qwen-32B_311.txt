Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. The article is about Donald Trump's inauguration, and the key morally charged word is "stolen." I need to make sure that word is included in the summary.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Trump's journey from announcing his candidacy to becoming president, his election over Hillary Clinton, and the factors that helped him win, including the stolen emails and Comey's actions.

I need to summarize this concisely, keeping it under 200 words. The summary should highlight Trump's unexpected rise, his victory despite trailing, and the role of the stolen emails and Comey's FBI probe. I must use "stolen" to maintain the moral framing.

I'll start by mentioning the 584 days since his announcement, his oath of office, and his background. Then, I'll note his primary victory and the anger towards the GOP establishment. Moving to the general election, I'll explain how he trailed but was aided by the stolen emails and Comey's decision. Finally, I'll state the narrow wins in the key states.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary details without being too verbose. I'll make sure to include the word "stolen" as specified and keep the moral tone intact.

SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. His journey from a New York real estate developer and reality TV star to the presidency was marked by an unlikely victory. Trump secured the Republican nomination despite facing 16 other candidates, capitalizing on a primary base angered by the GOP establishment's handling of President Barack Obama’s policies. In the general election, he trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but benefited from the near-daily release of stolen Democratic Party emails, attributed to Russian hackers, and FBI Director James Comey’s decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton’s private email server. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, defying Clinton’s expectations. END OF SUMMARY.
