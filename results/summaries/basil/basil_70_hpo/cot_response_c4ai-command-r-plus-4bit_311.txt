STEP 1:
* Angry
* Stolen

SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, capping an unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by an angry primary voting base, frustrated with the establishment GOP for their perceived lack of resistance to President Obama's policies. He narrowly won the election with the help of stolen Democratic Party emails released by Russian hackers and FBI interference in his opponent Hillary Clinton's email scandal. Trump's win, despite trailing Clinton for most of the race, underscores the power of tapping into the anger and frustrations of the electorate. END OF SUMMARY.
