SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping a meteoric rise from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was unexpected, as he defeated 16 other Republican candidates and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, despite trailing in the polls for most of the campaign. He capitalized on anti-establishment sentiment among primary voters and was aided by Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails and FBI scrutiny of Clinton's email practices. Trump's victory was secured by narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. His inauguration marked the culmination of a remarkable and unlikely political journey.
END OF SUMMARY.
