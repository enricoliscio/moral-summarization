SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, capping his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by an angry primary voting base that felt the establishment GOP didn't fight President Barack Obama's policies aggressively enough. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was helped by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen, briefly, the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations. Trump's unorthodox path to the presidency was marked by controversy and surprise. END OF SUMMARY.
