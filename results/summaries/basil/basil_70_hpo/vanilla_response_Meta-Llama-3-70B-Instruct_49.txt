SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump took the oath of office on Friday, becoming the 45th President of the United States. This marked the culmination of his unlikely journey from a New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump won the Republican nomination against 16 other candidates, capitalizing on a primary voting base angry at the establishment GOP. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was helped by the release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. Trump ultimately won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, securing his presidency.

END OF SUMMARY.
