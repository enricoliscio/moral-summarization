SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping a remarkable and unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was unexpected, as he defeated 16 other Republican candidates and Hillary Clinton, despite trailing in the polls for most of the campaign. His victory was secured by narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and was aided by the release of Democratic Party emails hacked by Russia and the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email server. Trump's inauguration marked the culmination of a controversial and divisive campaign, and his ascent to the presidency represented a significant shift in American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
