SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping a remarkable rise from reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was unexpected, as he defeated 16 other Republican candidates and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, despite trailing in the polls for most of the campaign. He capitalized on anti-establishment sentiment among primary voters and benefited from the release of hacked Democratic emails and an FBI investigation into Clinton's email server. Trump won the election by a narrow margin, taking Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes. His inauguration marked the culmination of a 584-day journey that began with his famous escalator ride at Trump Tower.
END OF SUMMARY.
