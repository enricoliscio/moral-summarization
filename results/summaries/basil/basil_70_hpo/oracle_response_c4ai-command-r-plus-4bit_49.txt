SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, capping a remarkable and unlikely rise from reality TV star to the nation's highest office. His journey to the presidency was marked by an angry primary voting base, directing their rage at the establishment GOP for their perceived inaction against President Barack Obama's policies. Trump's victory was secured by a narrow margin, aided by the release of internal Democratic Party emails that were stolen by Russian hackers, and FBI interference in his opponent Hillary Clinton's email scandal. Trump's win was an upset, as he trailed Clinton for most of the general election and defeated 16 other more politically experienced candidates in the Republican primaries.
END OF SUMMARY.
