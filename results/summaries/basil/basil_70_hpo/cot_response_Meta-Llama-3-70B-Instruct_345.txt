SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, capping his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by an angry primary voting base that felt the establishment GOP had not fought President Barack Obama's policies aggressively enough. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was helped by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a narrow margin of 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations. Trump's presidency marked a significant shift in American politics, driven by a desire for change and a rejection of the political establishment. END OF SUMMARY.
