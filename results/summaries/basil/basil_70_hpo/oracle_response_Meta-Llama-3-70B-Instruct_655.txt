SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, marking the end of his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's path to victory was paved by capitalizing on the anger of primary voters towards the establishment GOP for not aggressively fighting President Barack Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was aided by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers, as well as FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump ultimately won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, securing his presidency.

END OF SUMMARY.
