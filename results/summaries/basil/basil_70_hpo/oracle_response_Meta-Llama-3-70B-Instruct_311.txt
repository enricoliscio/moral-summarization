SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, marking the end of his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump capitalized on the anger of primary voters towards the establishment GOP, who they felt did not aggressively fight President Barack Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was helped by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers, as well as FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump ultimately won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations. The outcome was influenced by the unethical actions of Russian hackers, who stole sensitive information to sway the election. END OF SUMMARY.
