SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, marking the end of his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by an angry primary voting base dissatisfied with the establishment GOP, which he capitalized on to win the Republican nomination against 16 more experienced candidates. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump was aided by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump ultimately won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, defying Clinton's expectations.

END OF SUMMARY.
