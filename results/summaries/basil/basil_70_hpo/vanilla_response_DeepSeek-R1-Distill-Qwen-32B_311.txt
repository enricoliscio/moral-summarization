Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump becoming president. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that it's been 584 days since Trump announced his candidacy. He took the oath of office, becoming the 45th president, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. It's noted that this was an unlikely journey from being a real estate developer and TV personality to president.

Next, it talks about Trump winning the Republican nomination despite 16 other candidates, many more experienced. He capitalized on a primary base angry at the GOP establishment for not fighting Obama's policies. In the general election, he trailed Hillary Clinton but ended up winning key states: Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes. Clinton expected to win all three.

The article also mentions two factors that helped Trump: the release of hacked Democratic emails and Comey reopening the email server probe. These events were significant in the final month of the race.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main events: Trump's inauguration, his background, the primary victory, the general election details, the factors that influenced his win, and the states he won.

I should structure it clearly, starting with his inauguration, then his journey, followed by the primary and general election, and the factors that contributed to his victory. I need to make sure it's concise and captures all the essential information without going into too much detail.

Let me draft this step by step. First, mention the inauguration and the time since he announced his candidacy. Then, his background and the primary victory. Next, the general election, trailing Clinton but winning the key states. Finally, the factors that helped him: the hacked emails and Comey's action.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Let me put it all together concisely.
