STEP 1:
* Angry
* Hackers
* Aggressively

SUMMARY:
In an unlikely journey, Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States, despite his lack of political experience. He capitalized on the anger of Republican primary voters towards the GOP establishment, which was not fighting aggressively enough against President Obama's policies. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton in the general election but was aided by Russian hackers and FBI interference. He ultimately won the election by a narrow margin in key states, despite his controversial and divisive candidacy. END OF SUMMARY.
