SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV star, won the Republican nomination despite being less experienced in politics than his 16 opponents. He capitalized on voter anger towards the establishment GOP and its perceived failure to fight President Obama's policies. Trump trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, but was helped by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes, states Clinton had counted on winning. Trump's unlikely journey has led him to the nation's highest office. END OF SUMMARY.
