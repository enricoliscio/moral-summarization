Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I should first read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump took the oath of office 584 days after announcing his candidacy. It highlights his background as a real estate developer and reality TV star, which is an interesting contrast to becoming president. The author seems to present this as an "unlikely journey," which might imply some skepticism or surprise.

Next, it talks about Trump winning the Republican nomination despite having less political experience than others. The primary voters were angry at the GOP establishment for not fighting Obama's policies more. This suggests that Trump capitalized on their frustration, which could be framed as him being an outsider challenging the system.

In the general election, Trump trailed Clinton but ended up winning by a narrow margin in key states. The article mentions the stolen Democratic emails and Comey's reopening of the email investigation as factors aiding Trump. This part might have a moral implication, suggesting that external factors, possibly Russian interference, influenced the election outcome.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the time since announcing candidacy, his background, the primary victory, the factors in the general election, and the moral framing around the election's circumstances. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I should structure it to highlight the journey, the primary victory, the general election factors, and the moral aspects like the stolen emails and Comey's role. That should capture the essence and the author's framing effectively.
