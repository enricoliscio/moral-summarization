SUMMARY: After a long and contentious campaign, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, an unlikely rise for a political newcomer who harnessed the anger of an anti-establishment base to defeat more experienced Republican rivals and, in a close general election, Hillary Clinton. Trump's victory, enabled by a narrow margin of votes in key states, marked a shift in the political landscape as a real estate developer and reality TV star ascended to the nation's highest office. The road to the presidency began 584 days earlier when Trump descended an escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy, surprising many and sparking a journey fueled by voter frustration with the political status quo. Despite trailing Clinton for most of the general election, Trump benefited from the release of hacked Democratic emails and an FBI investigation into his opponent's email practices. Thus, Trump's win reflects a triumph of populist anger over political experience and a rebuke of the traditional political establishment.
END OF SUMMARY.
