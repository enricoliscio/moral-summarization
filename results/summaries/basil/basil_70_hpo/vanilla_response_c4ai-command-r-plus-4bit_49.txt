SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping a remarkable rise from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was unexpected, as he defeated 16 other Republican candidates and overcame a significant deficit in the polls to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump's victory was aided by the release of internal Democratic Party emails and FBI investigations into Clinton's email server. He ultimately won the election by a narrow margin, flipping Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Trump's inauguration marked the culmination of a controversial and divisive campaign, and his ascent to the presidency represented a significant shift in American politics.
