SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, a former reality TV star and real estate developer, took the oath of office to become the 45th President of the United States, marking an unlikely journey to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was fueled by anger towards the establishment GOP, and he capitalized on the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Hillary Clinton's email server. Despite trailing Clinton in the general election, Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a narrow margin of 78,000 votes, securing his presidency.

The moral framing of this article highlights the role of external factors in Trump's victory, including the release of stolen emails and Comey's decision, which raises questions about the integrity of the electoral process. It also underscores the anger and disillusionment of the voting base, which Trump was able to tap into and capitalize on.

END OF SUMMARY.
