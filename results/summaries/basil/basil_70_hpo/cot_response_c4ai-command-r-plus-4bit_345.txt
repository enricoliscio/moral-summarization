SUMMARY:
In an unlikely journey, Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States. He capitalized on the anger of Republican primary voters towards the GOP establishment, and won the nomination despite his lack of political experience. Trump's campaign was aided by the release of internal Democratic Party emails, stolen by Russian hackers, and by FBI Director James Comey's brief investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. Ultimately, Trump won the election by a narrow margin in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, despite trailing Clinton for most of the race. END OF SUMMARY.
