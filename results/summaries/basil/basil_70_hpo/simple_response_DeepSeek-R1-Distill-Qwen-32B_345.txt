Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump took the oath of office 584 days after announcing his candidacy. It highlights his journey from a real estate developer and TV personality to becoming president. It then talks about his victory in the Republican primaries despite having less political experience than others. The primary voters were angry at the GOP establishment for not opposing Obama's policies enough.

In the general election, Trump trailed Clinton but managed to win by a narrow margin in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. The article attributes his victory to the release of hacked Democratic emails and Comey's reopening of the email investigation. It also notes that Clinton expected to win those states.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points while maintaining the moral framing. The original article seems to imply that Trump's win was due to external factors like Russian interference and Comey's actions, which might carry a negative connotation. I should reflect that in the summary without adding my own opinions.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's inauguration, his background, his primary win, the general election struggle, the factors that helped him win, and the narrow margins in the key states. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft that. Start with Trump's inauguration, his background, how he won the nomination despite less experience, the primary voters' anger, trailing Clinton, the help from hacked emails and Comey, and the narrow victory in the three states. Make sure it's all within 200 words and ends with the specified tokens.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and sticks to the key points while preserving the moral elements from the original text.

SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. His journey from a New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office was marked by an unlikely victory in the Republican primaries, where he capitalized on a primary voting base angered by the GOP establishment's failure to oppose President Barack Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, defying expectations. His victory was aided by the near-daily release of hacked Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. Clinton had expected to secure all three states. END OF SUMMARY.
