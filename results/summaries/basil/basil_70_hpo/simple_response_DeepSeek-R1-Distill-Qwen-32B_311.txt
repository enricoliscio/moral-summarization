Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump becoming president, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, let me read through the article first.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump took the oath of office 584 days after announcing his candidacy. It talks about his journey from a real estate developer and reality TV star to becoming president. That's a big leap, so the author is highlighting his unlikely success. Then, it mentions that Trump won the Republican nomination against 16 other candidates, many more experienced. So, the author is pointing out that despite less political experience, he won.

Next, it says Trump capitalized on a primary voting base angry at the GOP establishment for not fighting Obama's policies. This shows that Trump was able to tap into a base that was frustrated with the current political establishment, which is a key moral point about the state of the party and the electorate's frustration.

The article then notes that Trump trailed Clinton in the general election but was helped by hacked emails and Comey's decision to reopen the email probe. This is where the moral framing might come in, suggesting that external factors, possibly unethical actions, influenced the election outcome. The author might be implying that the election wasn't just about the candidates but also about interference and political maneuvering.

Finally, Trump won the key states by a narrow margin, which shows how close the election was and how those external factors might have tipped the balance. The author is likely making a point about the fairness or integrity of the election process.

So, in the summary, I need to include these points: Trump's unlikely journey, his victory despite trailing, the role of hacked emails and Comey's actions, and the narrow win in key states. I should phrase it in a way that reflects the author's moral stance, which seems to be critical of how the election was influenced by external factors and possibly unethical behavior.

I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I need to capture the main events and the underlying moral implications without adding my own opinions, just reflecting the author's framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th U.S. President after a 584-day campaign, transitioning from a real estate developer and TV personality to the nation's leader. Despite trailing Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump won the Republican nomination over 16 candidates, many more experienced, by capitalizing on a GOP base angered at the establishment for not opposing Obama's policies. His victory was aided by hacked Democratic emails and FBI Director James Comey's reopened probe into Clinton's email use. Trump secured Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by 78,000 votes, states Clinton had expected to win. The election highlighted the influence of external factors and close margins, raising questions about the process's integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
