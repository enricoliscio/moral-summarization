SUMMARY:
In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States. His journey to the nation's highest office began 584 days earlier when he descended the Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy. Trump's win was unexpected, as he lacked political experience and was up against 16 other experienced Republican candidates. He capitalized on the anger of primary voters towards the establishment GOP, who they felt were not fighting aggressively enough against President Obama's policies. Trump's campaign was also *helped* by the release of internal Democratic Party emails, which were *stolen* by Russian hackers, and by FBI Director James Comey's *briefly* re-opened investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server use. Trump ultimately won the election by a narrow margin, securing Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, while Clinton had anticipated victory in these states. END OF SUMMARY.
