SUMMARY: In a stunning upset, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping off a remarkable and unlikely journey from reality TV star to leader of the free world. Trump's victory was a rebuke to the establishment GOP, as he tapped into a base of angry primary voters who felt betrayed by their party's failure to stand up to President Obama. While Trump trailed Hillary Clinton for most of the general election, he ultimately won by a narrow margin in key states, aided by Russian interference and FBI involvement. Trump's ascent to the presidency, which began with a now-iconic escalator ride, showcases the power of anti-establishment sentiment and the ability to harness it for political gain. It also serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the potential consequences of a political system that feels disconnected from the people it claims to represent. END OF SUMMARY.
