Alright, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key events and the underlying moral implications or themes the author presented.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. The article discusses Donald Trump's journey from announcing his candidacy to becoming president. It mentions his background as a real estate developer and TV personality, his unexpected victory in the Republican primaries, and his win in the general election despite trailing Hillary Clinton. It also touches on factors like the hacked emails and Comey's actions that influenced the election outcome.

Now, considering the moral framing, the article subtly points out that Trump's success was due to capitalizing on voter anger against the establishment and external factors like Russian interference and Comey's decision. This could imply a critique of how external influences and emotional appeals can affect election outcomes, highlighting the moral aspects of fair play and the integrity of the electoral process.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's inauguration, his background, the primary win, the general election details, and the factors that contributed to his victory, emphasizing the moral implications of those factors.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting from his candidacy announcement, through the primaries, the general election, and the key events that swayed the outcome. I'll also highlight the moral critique by noting the role of external factors and voter sentiment.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to be concise, making sure it captures all essential points without being too verbose. I'll end with the specified tokens to indicate the summary's boundaries.

SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, marking the end of his improbable journey from a New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation’s highest office. Trump, who announced his candidacy 584 days prior, secured the Republican nomination despite facing 16 other candidates, many with more political experience. His success was fueled by a primary base angered at the GOP establishment for not challenging President Barack Obama’s policies more aggressively. In the general election, Trump trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but ultimately won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, defying expectations. Key factors in his victory included the near-daily release of hacked Democratic emails and FBI Director James Comey’s decision to briefly reopen the investigation into Clinton’s email server. Trump’s ascension to the presidency highlights the complex interplay of voter sentiment, external influences, and the unpredictable nature of political campaigns. END OF SUMMARY.
