SUMMARY:
In an unlikely journey, Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States, despite his lack of political experience and initial underdog status within the crowded Republican field. He capitalized on the anger of primary voters towards the GOP establishment, and ultimately won the nomination. Trump's general election campaign was aided by the release of internal Democratic Party emails, stolen by Russian hackers, and by FBI Director James Comey's brief investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices. Trump's victory in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a narrow margin of 78,000 votes secured his path to the presidency. His ascension to power, marked by controversy and surprise, culminated in his oath of office, 584 days after he first announced his candidacy.
END OF SUMMARY.
