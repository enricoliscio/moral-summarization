Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration, preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It starts by mentioning the 584 days since Trump announced his candidacy and then his inauguration. The article highlights his background as a real estate developer and TV star, which is a bit unconventional for a president.

The author points out that Trump won the Republican nomination despite 16 other candidates, many more experienced. He capitalized on a base angry at the GOP establishment for not fighting Obama's policies. In the general election, he trailed Clinton but was helped by hacked emails and Comey's actions. He won the key states by a narrow margin.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points and maintains the moral framing, which seems to suggest that Trump's win was unexpected and possibly due to external factors like Russian interference and Comey's decision. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I'll start by stating Trump's inauguration after 584 days, his background, the nomination win, the reasons behind his success, the general election details, and the narrow victory. I'll make sure to mention the hacked emails and Comey's role as contributing factors. Finally, I'll note the total votes he won by in the key states.

Let me draft this, making sure it flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and captures the essence without losing the moral undertones.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, 584 days after announcing his candidacy. A former real estate developer and reality TV star, Trump's journey to the presidency was unconventional. He won the Republican nomination over 16 other candidates, many with more political experience, by tapping into a base angered at the GOP establishment for not challenging President Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump benefited from Russian-hacked Democratic emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's email use. Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes, defying expectations. END OF SUMMARY.
