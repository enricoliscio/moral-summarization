SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, marking the culmination of his unlikely journey from a real estate developer and reality TV star to the highest office in the land. Trump's victory was fueled by the anger of primary voters towards the establishment GOP, which they felt did not adequately oppose President Barack Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for most of the general election, Trump was aided by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's email server. Trump's narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania ultimately secured his presidency. This outcome is a testament to the power of populist sentiment and the importance of accountability in politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
