SUMMARY:

Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, completing his unlikely journey from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump won the Republican nomination despite being an outsider, capitalizing on voter anger towards the establishment GOP. He trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election but was helped by the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. Trump won the presidency by a narrow margin, taking Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes. Clinton had expected to win all three states.

END OF SUMMARY.
