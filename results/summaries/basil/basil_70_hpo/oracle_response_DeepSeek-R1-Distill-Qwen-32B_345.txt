Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the article uses the word "stolen" as a morally framed word, so I should make sure to include that.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Donald Trump becoming president, his journey from businessman to POTUS, his election win, and the factors that influenced it. The article mentions his unlikely path, winning the nomination despite 16 other candidates, the primary voters' anger, and the general election where he trailed but won with the help of stolen emails and Comey's decision.

I need to create a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by noting the main events: Trump's inauguration, his background, the nomination win, the primary voters' sentiment, the general election, the stolen emails, Comey's action, and the states he won.

I should make sure to include "stolen" when referring to the emails. Also, I need to maintain the moral tone, so words like "stolen" and "helped" by Comey's decision should be included as they carry that framing.

I'll structure the summary to flow from his candidacy to the election, highlighting the key factors. I'll ensure it's clear and within the word limit. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each important point is covered without going over 200 words.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th U.S. president on Friday, marking the end of his improbable journey from a New York real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation’s highest office. Trump, who announced his candidacy 584 days prior, took the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump won by securing Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined 78,000 votes. His victory was aided by the near-daily release of stolen Democratic Party emails, attributed to Russian hackers, and FBI Director James Comey’s decision to briefly reopen the investigation into Clinton’s private email server. Trump’s success also stemmed from a primary base angered at the GOP establishment for not challenging President Barack Obama’s policies more aggressively. His win defied expectations, as Clinton had expected to carry all three states. END OF SUMMARY.
