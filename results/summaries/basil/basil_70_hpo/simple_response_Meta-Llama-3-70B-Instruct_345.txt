SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV star, took the oath of office to become the 45th President of the United States, marking the culmination of his unlikely journey. Trump's victory was fueled by the anger of primary voters towards the establishment GOP, which they felt did not adequately oppose President Obama's policies. Despite trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump benefited from the release of stolen Democratic Party emails and FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into Clinton's email server. Trump ultimately won the presidency by a narrow margin of 78,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, states Clinton had expected to win.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump's victory was, in part, a result of exploiting the anger and frustration of voters towards the political establishment, and that his campaign was aided by external factors such as the release of stolen emails and the actions of the FBI director. This framing implies that Trump's presidency was not solely the result of his own merits, but rather the outcome of a complex interplay of factors.

END OF SUMMARY.
