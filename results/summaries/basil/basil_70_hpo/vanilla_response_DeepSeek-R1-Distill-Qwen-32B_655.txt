Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump becoming president. Let me read through it first. 

The article starts by mentioning that it's been 584 days since Trump announced his candidacy. He took the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. It's the 45th presidency. 

He came from being a real estate developer and a reality TV star, so that's an interesting background. He won the Republican nomination against 16 others, many with more political experience. He capitalized on the primary voters' anger at the GOP establishment for not fighting Obama's policies. 

In the general election, he trailed Hillary Clinton but ended up winning with the help of hacked emails and Comey reopening the email probe. He won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by 78,000 votes, which were states Clinton expected to win.

So, the summary needs to include the key points: the time since announcing candidacy, his oath, background, nomination win, primary support, general election challenges, and the states he won. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. 

I should structure it to flow from the announcement to the election results, highlighting his journey and the factors that led to his victory. Make sure to mention the stolen emails and Comey's role. 

Let me draft that, keeping each sentence focused on the main points without getting too detailed. Also, ensure that it starts after "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."
