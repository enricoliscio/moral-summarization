SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, capping a remarkable and unlikely rise from reality TV star to the nation's highest office. Trump's victory was unexpected, as he defeated 16 other Republican candidates and ultimately beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, despite trailing for most of the race. Trump's win was secured by narrow margins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and he benefited from the release of hacked Democratic Party emails and FBI investigations into Clinton's email server. Trump's inauguration marked the culmination of a campaign that tapped into a base of voters angry at the establishment and seeking a change from the policies of President Barack Obama.
END OF SUMMARY.
