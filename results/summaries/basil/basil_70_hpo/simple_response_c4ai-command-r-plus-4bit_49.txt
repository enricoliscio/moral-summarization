SUMMARY: After a shocking and unlikely journey, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, marking a victory for angry primary voters who were fed up with the establishment GOP and its failure to stand against President Barack Obama's policies. Despite trailing Hillary Clinton for most of the general election, Trump ultimately won key states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a narrow margin. This outcome was influenced by the release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers and FBI Director James Comey's controversial decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Trump's ascendancy from real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation's highest office is a testament to the power of anti-establishment sentiment and the unpredictable nature of American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
