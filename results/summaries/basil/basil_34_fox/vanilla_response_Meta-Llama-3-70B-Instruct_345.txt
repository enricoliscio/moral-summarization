SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report recommending that states allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. The report, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons. The NRA argues that improving school security is paramount, citing the need for schools to have at least one armed officer. The report also calls for states to require schools to conduct safety assessments and for a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's stance has been criticized by Democrats, who argue that the focus should be on gun control measures. The report comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some states focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans.
