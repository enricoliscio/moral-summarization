SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. This recommendation is part of a 225-page report that aims to improve school security in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that "it's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools." He believes that "the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The report proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law that would allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's efforts come as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans.
