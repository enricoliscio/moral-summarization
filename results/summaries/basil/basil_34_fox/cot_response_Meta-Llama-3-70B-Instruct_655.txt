SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following a weeks-long review after the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that schools should be afforded the same "absolute protection" as banks and members of Congress. He believes that "the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The review also calls for states to require schools to conduct safety assessments and create a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. Mark Mattioli, the father of a Newtown shooting victim, has applauded the review effort. END OF SUMMARY.
