SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, calling for extensive training programs to ensure safety. This recommendation comes after a weeks-long review following the Newtown mass shooting, which killed 26 people. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, initially faced criticism for focusing on school security and rejecting gun control measures. However, the NRA's review leader, Asa Hutchinson, has proposed a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The report also emphasizes the need for schools to conduct safety assessments and for a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. While some states have focused on gun control legislation, the NRA argues that improving school security is paramount, citing the need for "absolute protection" to stop "monsters" from killing children.
