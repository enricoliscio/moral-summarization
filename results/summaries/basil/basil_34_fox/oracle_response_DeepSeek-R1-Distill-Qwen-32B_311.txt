Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about the NRA urging states to allow more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting. They're suggesting extensive training for school personnel to carry weapons. 

The author uses several morally charged words like "carry," "shooting," "rejecting," "killed," "approved," "enacting," "expanding," "bans," "restrict," "improving," "protection," and "stops." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the NRA's recommendations, the context of the Newtown shooting, the criticism they received, the specifics of their proposals like the training program and model law, and the reactions from other states and individuals. 

I also need to mention the opposing actions, like other states focusing on gun control measures. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me structure it: first, introduce the NRA's call after Newtown. Then mention the criticism they faced. Next, detail their recommendations, including the training and model law. Highlight that they don't want all teachers armed, just some personnel. Also, note the other parts of their report, like safety assessments and mental health programs. Then, mention the opposing actions in other states and the NRA's stance on protection. Finally, include the quote from Wayne LaPierre about stopping a bad guy with a gun.

I should make sure each sentence includes the moral words where appropriate. For example, "urged states to allow more armed officers" uses "allow" and "armed," but "armed" isn't in the list, so maybe focus on "carry" instead. Wait, "carry" is in the list, so perhaps rephrase to include that.

Also, I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too detailed. Let me draft it step by step, checking each sentence to include the moral words where possible.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following the Newtown mass shooting where 26 people were killed. The NRA proposed a 40-60 hour training program for school personnel to carry weapons, emphasizing that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying guns. The group also recommended a model state law to enable trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. While former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, leading the NRA's review, acknowledged local decision-making, he stressed the importance of at least one armed officer per school. The NRA's recommendations also included safety assessments and mental health pilot programs. Meanwhile, many states have focused on enacting or expanding gun control measures, such as assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks. Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, is advancing a sweeping gun control proposal. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre argued that improving school security is paramount, stating, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." END OF SUMMARY.
