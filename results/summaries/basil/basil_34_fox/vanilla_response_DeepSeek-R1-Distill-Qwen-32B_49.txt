Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's recommendations after the Newtown shooting. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying the NRA urged states to allow more armed officers in schools after a weeks-long review following the Newtown mass shooting. They want school personnel to carry weapons after extensive training. The NRA faced criticism from Democrats for focusing on school security instead of gun control. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre wanted armed officers in every school, but Asa Hutchinson, who led the review, softened that stance. He said every school should have at least one armed officer but decisions are local based on budgets. They proposed a 40-60 hour training program and a model state law allowing trained personnel to carry weapons, but not all teachers. The report also suggested school safety assessments and a pilot program on mental health. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supported the effort. Meanwhile, Congress and states are pursuing gun control, like assault weapons bans and background checks. Connecticut is advancing a gun control proposal. LaPierre argued school security is crucial, comparing it to protection for banks and Congress, saying only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad one.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: NRA's call for armed officers in schools, the response to Newtown, criticism from Democrats, the training program, the model law, not all teachers, safety assessments, mental health pilot, support from Mattioli, other states focusing on gun control, and LaPierre's argument about security.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the NRA's recommendation, the context of Newtown, the specifics of their proposals, other responses, and LaPierre's stance. I need to make sure it's concise and covers all main points without being too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to hit each key point succinctly.
