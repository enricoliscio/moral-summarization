SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) is urging states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, following a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting that killed 26 people. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, initially faced criticism for rejecting gun control measures and focusing on school security. However, the NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The review also calls for states to require schools to conduct safety assessments and create a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. LaPierre argues that improving school security is paramount, stating that "the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The NRA's proposal comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting and expanding assault weapons bans.
