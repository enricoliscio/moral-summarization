SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the Newtown mass shooting, has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after they have completed extensive training. The NRA's initial response to the shooting, which focused on improving school security rather than implementing gun control measures, faced criticism from Democrats. While the NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, previously called for armed officers in every school, the NRA's review group, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, has proposed a more flexible approach, recommending a training program for armed officers and a model state law that would allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The group's 225-page report also called for mandatory school safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a predictor of violence. The NRA's recommendations come as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on restricting access to firearms. The NRA maintains that improving school security is paramount to protecting students and staff from future attacks.
