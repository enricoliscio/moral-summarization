Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the NRA urging states to allow more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting. They're suggesting extensive training and a model law. They also mention other measures like safety assessments and mental health programs. The author used specific morally charged words, so I need to include those in the summary.

I need to make sure I capture the key points: the NRA's recommendations, the criticism they received, the details of the training program, the model law, and the context of other gun control efforts. I should also mention the emotional aspect, like the father applauding the effort and the NRA's argument about protection.

I'll structure the summary to include all these elements concisely. I'll start by stating the NRA's call, mention the training and model law, then touch on the other recommendations. I'll note the criticism and the counterarguments, ensuring to use the morally framed words like 'carry,''shooting,''rejecting,' 'killed,' etc. I'll keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has called on state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after extensive training, following the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's recommendations include a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a model state law enabling trained personnel to carry weapons, though not all teachers. The group also proposed safety assessments and mental health programs to prevent violence. Critics, including Democrats, have rejected the NRA's focus on school security over gun control measures, such as bans and background checks. Connecticut is advancing sweeping gun control legislation, while states like South Dakota have approved arming teachers. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre emphasized the importance of protection, stating, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The review comes amid national debates on improving school security and restricting access to firearms. END OF SUMMARY.
