SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has responded to criticism from Democrats for their stance on school security in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting, where 26 individuals fell victim to gun violence. The NRA CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has urged state legislatures to authorize more armed officers in schools, suggesting that protection is paramount. He argued that if banks and lawmakers can be protected, then schools should be too. The NRA's review, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, calls for a trained "good guy with a gun" to stop a potential shooter and for every school to have at least one armed officer, while acknowledging that this decision should be locally made. The report also recommends a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence and for schools to conduct safety assessments. This shift in focus towards school security comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some concentrating on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks, and restricting access to firearms. Mark Mattioli, a father of a Newtown victim, applauded the NRA's efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
