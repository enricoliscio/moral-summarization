SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report recommending that states allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. The report, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to enable certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that schools should have the same level of protection as banks and members of Congress. LaPierre believes that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The report's recommendations come as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks.

The NRA's stance has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue that the organization is rejecting gun control measures. However, the report's emphasis on school security and the need for "absolute protection" reflects a moral framing that prioritizes the safety of children and the importance of taking responsibility for their protection.
