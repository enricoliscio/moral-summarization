SUMMARY: In the wake of the Newtown mass shooting that killed 26 people, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has been under fire for rejecting gun control measures and instead focusing on improving school security. The NRA CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has called for armed officers to be present in every school across the country, arguing that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's review, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, has resulted in a 225-page report that calls for states to allow trained school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds and for the creation of a training program for armed officers. The report also recommends mental health assessments and improved safety measures in schools. While the NRA's stance has faced criticism, some states, like South Dakota, have approved legislation allowing teachers to be armed. Meanwhile, other state legislatures and Congress are pushing for gun control legislation, including expanding assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks to restrict access to firearms. The debate continues as communities seek to find the best ways to protect schools and prevent future shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
