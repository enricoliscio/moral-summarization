SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has called on state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. This recommendation is part of a 225-page report following the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, initially faced criticism for focusing on school security rather than gun control measures. The report proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law allowing trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. It also recommends states require schools to conduct safety assessments and create a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's stance contrasts with many state legislatures and Congress, which are pursuing gun control legislation, including assault weapons bans and strengthened background checks. LaPierre argues that improving school security is paramount, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
