SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after undergoing extensive training. This recommendation comes after the Newtown mass shooting and criticism of the NRA's initial focus on school security instead of gun control measures. While the NRA CEO previously called for armed officers in every school, the NRA's review group has slightly eased off on this stance, acknowledging that decisions are locally made based on budget constraints. The group has proposed a training program for armed officers and a model state law to allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The report also calls for mandatory school safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. This review comes as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on restricting access to firearms. The NRA maintains that improving school security is paramount to protect students from potential threats.
