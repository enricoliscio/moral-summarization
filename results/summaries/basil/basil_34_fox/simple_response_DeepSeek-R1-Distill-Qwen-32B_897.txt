Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's recommendations for school security after the Newtown shooting. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The NRA is pushing states to allow more armed personnel in schools after extensive training. They released a 225-page report with several recommendations, including a training program and model state laws. They also mentioned conducting safety assessments and a pilot program for mental health. However, they don't want all teachers to carry guns, just certain personnel.

There's some criticism from Democrats for focusing on security instead of gun control. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, emphasized that schools need the same protection as other secure places like banks and Congress. They argue that having armed officers is necessary to protect students, stating that only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy.

I need to make sure the summary captures the NRA's stance and the moral arguments they're making. They're framing it as a responsibility to protect schools, similar to other secure locations, and that armed presence is the solution. I should also mention the criticism they're facing for not supporting gun control measures.

I'll structure the summary to include the key recommendations, the moral argument about responsibility, and the criticism. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language straightforward.

Let me start by outlining the main points:
1. NRA recommends more armed personnel in schools after Newtown shooting.
2. Recommendations include training programs and model laws.
3. They don't want all teachers armed, just specific personnel.
4. Criticism from Democrats for not focusing on gun control.
5. Moral argument: Schools should have same protection as banks and Congress.
6. NRA's stance on needing armed presence to prevent violence.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all these points while highlighting the moral framing.
