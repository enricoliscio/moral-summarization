SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in a morally questionable move, continues to advocate for more guns as a solution to gun violence by urging states to allow more armed officers in schools. This stance, which prioritizes school security over gun control, has drawn criticism from Democrats and gun control advocates. While the NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, initially called for armed officers in every school, the NRA's review leader, former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, softened this stance slightly by acknowledging local budget constraints. Hutchinson proposed a training program for armed officers and a model state law to allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's review, which was applauded by a Newtown victim's father, comes as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans and background checks. LaPierre's argument, that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," frames the issue in a simplistic and morally dubious manner that ignores the complexities of gun violence and its prevention.

END OF SUMMARY.
