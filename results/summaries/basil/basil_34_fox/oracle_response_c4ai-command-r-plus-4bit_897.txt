SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the tragic Newtown school shooting that left 26 people killed, has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after receiving extensive training. The NRA's initial focus on school security and rejecting gun control measures sparked criticism from Democrats. While the NRA CEO, Wayne LaPierre, previously called for armed officers in every school, the NRA's review leader, former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, softened this stance, acknowledging budget constraints and local decision-making. Hutchinson proposed a training program for armed officers and a model state law to allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The review also called for mandatory school safety assessments and a pilot program to evaluate mental health as a predictor of violence. The NRA's stance contrasts with recent gun control efforts by Congress and state legislatures, including expanding assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks to restrict access to firearms. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supported the NRA's review. LaPierre emphasizes that improving school security is crucial, stating that only a "good guy with a gun" can stop a "bad guy with a gun."
