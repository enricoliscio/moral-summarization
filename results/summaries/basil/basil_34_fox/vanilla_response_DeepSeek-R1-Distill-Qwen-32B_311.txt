Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's recommendations after the Newtown shooting. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says the NRA urged states to allow more armed officers in schools after a weeks-long review following the Newtown mass shooting. They want school personnel to carry weapons after extensive training. Initially, they faced criticism from Democrats for focusing on school security instead of gun control. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre wanted armed officers in every school, but Asa Hutchinson, who led the review, softened that stance, saying each school should have at least one armed officer, but it's a local decision based on budget. They proposed a 40-60 hour training program and a model law allowing trained personnel to carry weapons, but not all teachers. The report also suggested safety assessments and a mental health pilot program. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supported the review. Meanwhile, Congress and states are considering gun control measures, like assault weapon bans and background checks. Connecticut is advancing a gun control proposal. LaPierre emphasized school security as a priority, comparing it to protection for banks and Congress.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the NRA's recommendations, the training program, the model law, the mental health initiative, and the context of other gun control efforts. I'll also mention the criticism and LaPierre's argument.

I should structure it to start with the NRA's call, mention the training and model law, note the focus on school security over gun control, include the mental health aspect, and end with the broader legislative context. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit.

Let me draft it: The NRA recommended more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting, emphasizing training and a model law for trained personnel. They focused on school security, facing criticism for not supporting gun control. The report also suggested safety assessments and mental health programs. While some states are enacting gun control measures, the NRA prioritizes school protection, arguing it's essential to protect students.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details without being too lengthy. Let me adjust: The NRA called for states to allow armed personnel in schools after the Newtown shooting, proposing a 40-60 hour training program and a model law. They emphasized school security over gun control, facing criticism. The report also recommended safety assessments and a mental health pilot program. While some states focus on gun control, the NRA argues school protection is crucial, comparing it to other secure environments.

Hmm, still a bit short. Maybe add that the NRA's review was weeks-long and that they softened the stance on every school having armed officers, but still pushed for at least one. Also, mention that Connecticut is advancing a gun control proposal.

Putting it all together: The NRA has urged states to permit more armed personnel in schools following the Newtown shooting, proposing a 40-60 hour training program and a model law. They emphasized school security over gun control, facing criticism. The report also suggested safety assessments and a mental health pilot program. While some states focus on gun control measures like assault weapon bans, the NRA argues school protection is paramount, comparing it to other secure environments.

That's around 100 words. I think that covers the main points without exceeding the limit.
