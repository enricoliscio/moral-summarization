Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure I include as many of those words as possible in the summary without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NRA is pushing for more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting. They want states to allow trained personnel to carry weapons. They've proposed a training program and a model law. Some states are focusing on school security, while others are enacting gun control measures. The NRA's stance is that having armed officers is the best way to protect students.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the article. They include words like "carry," "shooting," "rejecting," "measures," "killed," "approved," "enacting," "expanding," "bans," "strengthening," "restrict," "improving," "killing," "protection," and "stops." I should incorporate these into the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key points: NRA's recommendations post-Newtown shooting, the call for armed officers, the training program, the model law, the states' differing approaches, and the NRA's argument that armed personnel are necessary for protection.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the moral framing. For example, using "carry" when talking about personnel having weapons, "killed" to emphasize the tragedy, "rejecting" to show opposition to gun control, and "stops" to highlight the NRA's belief in the effectiveness of armed personnel.

I'll also need to keep the summary concise. Let me draft a few sentences, making sure each includes the key points and the moral words. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover the NRA's stance, the recommendations, the reactions from other states, and the underlying moral arguments about protection and responsibility.

SUMMARY: The NRA has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following the Newtown shooting, where 26 people were killed. The organization proposed a 40-60 hour training program for armed personnel and a model law enabling trained individuals to carry weapons on school grounds. While NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre called for armed officers in every school, former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson emphasized that decisions should be locally made. The 225-page report also recommended safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. Meanwhile, many states are enacting or expanding gun control measures, such as assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks, while Connecticut is advancing a sweeping gun control proposal. LaPierre argued that improving school security is paramount, stating, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's focus on protection and stopping violence contrasts with efforts to restrict access to firearms. END OF SUMMARY.
