STEP 1:
* responsible
* monster
* bad
* good
* absolute

SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following a weeks-long review after the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that "it's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools." He believes that schools should have the same level of protection as banks and members of Congress. LaPierre emphasized that "the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. While some critics have focused on gun control measures, the NRA's approach prioritizes school security, with LaPierre arguing that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
