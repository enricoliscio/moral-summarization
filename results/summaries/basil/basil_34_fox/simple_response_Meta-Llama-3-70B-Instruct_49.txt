SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. This recommendation is part of a 225-page report that emphasizes the importance of improving school security in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's proposal includes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law that would allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The report also calls for states to require schools to conduct safety assessments and for a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." This stance has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue that the NRA is rejecting gun control measures.
