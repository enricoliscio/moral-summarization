SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has responded to criticism from Democrats for its focus on school security in the wake of the Newtown massacre by urging state legislatures to allow more armed officers in schools. While the NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, initially called for armed officers in every school, the organization's review leader, former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, has slightly eased this stance, acknowledging that such decisions are locally made. Hutchinson has proposed a training program for armed officers and a model state law to allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The report also emphasizes the importance of school safety assessments and addressing mental health as a predictor of violence. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, applauded the review. The NRA's stance on school security stands in contrast to the pursuit of gun control legislation by Congress and some states, with Connecticut being the latest to propose sweeping gun control measures. LaPierre emphasizes the moral responsibility to protect schools, arguing that only a "good guy with a gun" can stop a "bad guy with a gun," and that it is imperative to assume responsibility for the safety of children against monsters who kill.
