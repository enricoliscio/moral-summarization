Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's recommendations regarding armed officers in schools. The user is asking me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, okay, so I should focus on the main points and the underlying messages.

First, the article mentions that the NRA is urging states to allow more armed personnel in schools after the Newtown shooting. They want extensive training for these officers. I should note that they're not just pushing for any armed individuals but specifically trained ones. 

The article also talks about criticism from Democrats, who are against this approach and prefer gun control measures. I should highlight that the NRA's stance is being opposed by some, showing the divide on the issue.

Wayne LaPierre's quote about protecting schools like banks and Congress is a strong moral statement. He's equating school security with other protected institutions, which is a key point to include. 

Asa Hutchinson's role is important too. He led the review but softened the call a bit, saying each school should have at least one armed officer, but it's up to local decisions. This shows a slight compromise but still maintains the core recommendation.

The training program and model law are part of their plan, emphasizing that not all teachers would carry guns, only those trained. This addresses the concern that it's not about arming all educators, which is a common criticism.

The report also suggests other measures like safety assessments and mental health programs. These are additional steps beyond just arming personnel, showing a broader approach to school safety.

Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supports the review, adding a personal touch and credibility to the NRA's recommendations.

Finally, the context of other states focusing on gun control measures, like Connecticut, shows the broader debate happening. The NRA's position is in contrast to these efforts, highlighting the ongoing conflict between security and gun control.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements while keeping the moral arguments intact. I'll structure it to first present the NRA's recommendations, then the criticism, followed by the specifics of their plan, and conclude with the broader context and support.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has recommended that states allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after extensive training, following the Newtown mass shooting. While the NRA initially faced criticism from Democrats for focusing on school security over gun control, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre argued that schools should have the same protection as banks and Congress. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, softened the call for armed officers in every school, stating that each school should have at least one armed officer, with decisions made locally. The NRA proposed a 40-60 hour training program and a model state law allowing trained personnel to carry weapons. Hutchinson emphasized that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying guns. The 225-page report also called for school safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a violence indicator. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supported the review. Meanwhile, many states are pursuing gun control measures, such as assault weapons bans and background checks, while Connecticut advanced a sweeping gun control proposal. LaPierre maintained that school security is paramount, asserting that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." END OF SUMMARY.
