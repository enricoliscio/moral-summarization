Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the NRA urging states to allow more armed officers in schools. My task is to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. These are words that carry a moral connotation, either positive or negative. They can indicate approval, disapproval, or a value judgment. So, I should go through the article and pick out words that have such connotations.

Looking at the article, I'll start by reading through it to get the gist. The NRA is advocating for more armed personnel in schools after the Newtown shooting. They suggest extensive training and a model law. There's criticism from Democrats, and the NRA's CEO emphasizes the importance of protection, comparing it to other secure places like banks and Congress.

Now, I'll go through each sentence to spot morally charged words. Words like "criticism," "rejecting," "rejected," "good," "bad," "protection," "responsible," "absolute protection," "monster," "bad guy," "good guy," "afforded," "restrict," "sweeping," "dealing," "approval," "concentrated," "expanding," "restrict access," "afforded," "protection," "responsible," "absolute protection," "monster," "bad guy," "good guy," "afforded," "restrict," "sweeping," "dealing," "approval," "concentrated," "expanding," "restrict access," "afforded," "protection," "responsible," "absolute protection," "monster," "bad guy," "good guy," "afforded," "restrict," "sweeping," "dealing," "approval," "concentrated," "expanding," "restrict access."

Wait, I think I might have repeated some. Let me list them without duplication:

- Criticism
- Rejecting
- Rejected
- Good
- Bad
- Protection
- Responsible
- Absolute protection
- Monster
- Bad guy
- Good guy
- Afforded
- Restrict
- Sweeping
- Dealing
- Approval
- Concentrated
- Expanding
- Restrict access

These words carry moral weight because they imply judgment or value. For example, "criticism" suggests disapproval, "good" and "bad" are evaluative, "protection" implies care and responsibility, and "monster" is a strong negative label.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the article while preserving the moral framing.

I'll start by outlining the main points: NRA's call for armed officers, criticism from Democrats, details of the recommendations, reactions from the NRA and others, and the context of ongoing gun control debates.

I'll make sure to include the morally framed words naturally within the summary. For example, mentioning the criticism, the focus on protection, the responsible approach, and the contrasting views on gun control.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral perspective presented in the original article. I should avoid adding my own opinions but stick to the framing provided.

I think I've got a good grasp now. Time to draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes the key morally framed words.

**SUMMARY:**  
The NRA has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following the Newtown shooting, as part of its recommendations. Critics, including Democrats, have accused the NRA of focusing on school security while rejecting gun control measures. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre has called for armed officers in every school, but the group's review, led by Asa Hutchinson, softened the stance slightly, emphasizing at least one armed officer per school based on local needs. The report proposed a 40-60 hour training program for armed personnel and a model law allowing trained school personnel to carry weapons. Hutchinson clarified that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying guns. The review also recommended safety assessments and a mental health pilot program. Meanwhile, states like Connecticut are advancing sweeping gun control measures, while others focus on school security. LaPierre argued that schools deserve the same protection as banks and Congress, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's push for protection has sparked debate over responsibility and security in schools.
