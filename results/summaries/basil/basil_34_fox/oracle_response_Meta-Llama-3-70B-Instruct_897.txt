SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) is urging states to allow more armed officers in schools, following a weeks-long review after the Newtown mass shooting that killed 26 people. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, argued that improving school security is paramount, and that schools deserve the same protection as banks and members of Congress. The NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law allowing certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The review also calls for states to require schools to conduct safety assessments and create a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. While some states have focused on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks, and restricting access to firearms, the NRA believes that allowing more armed officers in schools is key to stopping "monsters" from killing children. The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun, according to LaPierre, is a good guy with a gun.
