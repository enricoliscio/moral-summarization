SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has called on state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. This recommendation is part of a 225-page report following a review of school safety in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The report also calls for schools to conduct safety assessments and for a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. While some states have focused on gun control legislation, the NRA argues that improving school security is paramount, citing that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools should too.
