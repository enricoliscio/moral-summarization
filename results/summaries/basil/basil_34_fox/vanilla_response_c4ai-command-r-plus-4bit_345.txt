SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the Newtown mass shooting, has urged state legislatures to permit more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after comprehensive training. While the NRA initially faced criticism for prioritizing school security over gun control, its CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has advocated for armed officers in every school. Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, leading the NRA's review, softened this stance, acknowledging local budget constraints but emphasizing the importance of at least one armed officer per school. Hutchinson proposed a training program for armed officers and a model state law enabling trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The report also recommended mandatory school safety assessments and a pilot program evaluating mental health as a predictor of violence. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supported the review. The NRA's stance contrasts with recent gun control efforts in Congress and state legislatures, with some focusing on school security and others pushing for assault weapons bans, enhanced background checks, and restrictions on firearm access. Connecticut is the latest state to propose comprehensive gun control measures. LaPierre emphasizes that improving school security is crucial to protecting students, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
