Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article about the NRA's recommendations after the Newtown shooting. The user wants me to first identify the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those moral frames. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context. The NRA is pushing for more armed officers in schools, which is a response to the Newtown shooting where 26 people were killed. Theyâ€™re suggesting extensive training for school personnel to carry weapons. There's some criticism from Democrats, and the NRA's stance is about school security over gun control.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral framing. These are words that imply values, judgments, or ethical considerations. Let me go through the article again.

Looking for words like "criticism," "rejecting," "important," "unique," "model," "applaud," "sweeping," "protection," "responsible," "monster," "good," "bad." These words seem to carry moral weight because they express approval, disapproval, or ethical implications.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping as many of these moral words as possible. I should mention the NRA's call for armed officers, the criticism they received, the details of their recommendations like the training program and model law, the acknowledgment that decisions are locally made, the other measures like safety assessments and mental health programs, the support from a Newtown victim's father, and the contrast with other states focusing on gun control.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Putting it all together, I'll start by stating the NRA's main recommendation, mention the criticism, outline their specific suggestions, note the local decision aspect, include the other safety measures, mention the support, and contrast with other states' approaches. I'll ensure that the moral words are included to reflect the author's framing.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and captures all the key points with the moral framing intact.

**SUMMARY:**  
The NRA has called for states to allow more armed officers in schools, following the Newtown shooting, where 26 people were killed. While initially criticized for focusing on school security over gun control, the NRA proposed a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to enable trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson emphasized that decisions should be "locally made" but stressed the importance of at least one armed officer per school. The NRA also recommended safety assessments and mental health pilot programs. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, praised the effort. Meanwhile, many states are pursuing stricter gun control measures, such as assault weapons bans and background checks, while Connecticut advanced a sweeping gun control proposal. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre argued that schools deserve the same protection as banks and Congress, stating, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
