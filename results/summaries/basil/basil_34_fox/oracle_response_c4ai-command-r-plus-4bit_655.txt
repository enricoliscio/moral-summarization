SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the tragic Newtown shooting that killed 26 people, has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's initial response to the shooting, which rejected gun control measures, faced criticism from Democrats. While the NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, previously called for armed officers in every school, the NRA's review has softened this stance, acknowledging that decisions are locally made. The review instead proposes a training program for armed officers and recommends a model state law to allow trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The report also calls for mandatory school safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a predictor of violence. This review comes as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding bans and restricting access to firearms. The state of Connecticut is leading the way with a sweeping gun control proposal. Improving school security and protecting our children from killers is of paramount importance, and the NRA argues that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun.
