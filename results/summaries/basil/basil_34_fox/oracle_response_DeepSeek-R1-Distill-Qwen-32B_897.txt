Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the NRA urging states to allow more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting. They want school personnel to carry weapons after extensive training. The author used words like "carry," "shooting," "rejecting," "measures," "killed," "approved," "enacting," "expanding," "bans," "restrict," "improving," "killing," "protection," and "stops." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, the NRA's main recommendation is to allow more armed officers in schools. They proposed a training program and a model law. They also emphasized that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying weapons. The report includes other measures like safety assessments and mental health pilot programs.

On the other hand, some states are focusing on gun control measures like bans and background checks. Connecticut is advancing a gun control proposal. The NRA argues that improving school security is more important than gun control, likening it to protecting banks and Congress.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the specified moral words as possible. I should structure it to highlight the NRA's stance, their recommendations, the counterarguments from other states, and the moral implications of both sides.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral framing words. I'll start with the NRA's call, mention the training and model law, the focus on teachers teaching, other measures like assessments and mental health, then contrast with other states' gun control efforts, and end with the NRA's argument about protection and stopping violence.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all the moral words are appropriately included without forcing them in unnaturally. Also, the summary should flow logically, connecting each point smoothly.

SUMMARY: The NRA has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following the Newtown shooting, where 26 people were killed. The organization proposed a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a model state law enabling trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, emphasizing that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying guns. The 225-page report also recommended safety assessments and a mental health pilot program to identify violence risks. While the NRA rejected gun control measures, many states are enacting or expanding assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks to restrict firearm access. Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, is advancing a sweeping gun control proposal. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun. The NRAâ€™s focus on protection and stopping violence contrasts with efforts to restrict access to firearms through bans and other measures. END OF SUMMARY.
