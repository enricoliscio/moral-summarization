Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's recommendations regarding armed officers in schools. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NRA is urging states to allow more armed personnel in schools after the Newtown shooting. They propose extensive training and a model law for states. There's criticism from Democrats, and the NRA emphasizes school security over gun control. They mention that teachers shouldn't be armed, only trained personnel. The report also includes other measures like safety assessments and mental health programs. Some states are focusing on gun control, while others are looking at school security.

Now, I need to capture the moral arguments. The NRA's stance is about protection and responsibility, arguing that schools need the same security as other protected places. They believe that having armed officers is the best way to prevent such tragedies. On the other hand, there's criticism that they're ignoring gun control measures, which is another moral angle about reducing access to firearms.

I should structure the summary to include both the NRA's recommendations and the criticisms, highlighting the moral perspectives on security versus gun control. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it ends with the required tokens.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include key points: NRA's call for armed personnel, training programs, model law, criticism, other recommendations, and the contrast with gun control efforts. I'll balance both sides to reflect the moral framing accurately.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and flows naturally, ending with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY:  
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after extensive training, following the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's recommendations, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, include a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a model state law to enable trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. Hutchinson emphasized that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying guns. The NRA's report also called for school safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a violence indicator.  

Critics argue the NRA's focus on school security overlooks gun control measures, such as assault weapons bans and background checks, which many states are pursuing. Connecticut, the site of the Sandy Hook shooting, is advancing sweeping gun control legislation. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre has argued that schools deserve the same protection as banks and Congress, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."  

The NRA's stance reflects a moral framing of responsibility and protection, while critics highlight the need for broader gun control to prevent such tragedies.
