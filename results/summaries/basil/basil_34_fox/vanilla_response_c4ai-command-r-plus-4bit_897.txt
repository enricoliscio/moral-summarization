SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the Newtown mass shooting, has recommended that state legislatures allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after undergoing extensive training. While the NRA's initial response to the shooting focused on school security and rejected gun control measures, the organization's latest review calls for the creation of a training program for armed officers and a model state law allowing certain trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The report also recommends mandatory school safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has emphasized the importance of improving school security, arguing that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's review comes as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans and background checks. Mark Mattioli, the father of a Newtown shooting victim, applauded the NRA's review effort.
