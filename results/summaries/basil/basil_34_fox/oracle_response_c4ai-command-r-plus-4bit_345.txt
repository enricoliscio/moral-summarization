SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in the wake of the Newtown shooting that killed 26 people, has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after receiving extensive training. While the NRA initially faced criticism for rejecting gun control measures and focusing on school security, their recent review calls for a more nuanced approach. Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the review, recommended the creation of a training program for armed officers and proposed a model state law to allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The report also emphasized the need for schools to conduct safety assessments and address mental health as a predictor of violence. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, supported the review's efforts. This review comes as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding bans and background checks to restrict access to firearms. Connecticut is leading the way with a sweeping gun control proposal. The NRA's stance prioritizes improving school security and protection, arguing that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
