SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, following a weeks-long review after the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has emphasized the importance of improving school security, arguing that schools deserve the same "absolute protection" as banks and members of Congress. He believes that "the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law allowing certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. While some lawmakers have focused on gun control measures, the NRA's approach prioritizes school security, with LaPierre asserting that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
