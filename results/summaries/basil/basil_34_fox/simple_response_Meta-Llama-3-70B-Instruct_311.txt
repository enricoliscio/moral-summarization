SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) is urging states to allow more armed officers in schools, following a weeks-long review after the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, initially faced criticism for focusing on school security instead of gun control measures. However, the NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The review also calls for safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. LaPierre argues that improving school security is paramount, stating that schools should have the same level of protection as banks and members of Congress. He believes that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's stance is morally framed as a responsible and necessary measure to protect children, with LaPierre emphasizing the need for "absolute protection" in schools.
