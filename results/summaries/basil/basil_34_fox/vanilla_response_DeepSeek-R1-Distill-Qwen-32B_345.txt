Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's recommendations after the Newtown shooting. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning the NRA urging states to allow more armed officers in schools after extensive training. They released a report following a weeks-long review post-Newtown. Initially, they faced criticism from Democrats for focusing on security instead of gun control. NRA's CEO Wayne LaPierre wanted armed officers in every school, but Asa Hutchinson, who led the review, softened that stance, saying each school should have at least one officer, but it's up to local decisions. They proposed a 40-60 hour training program and a model law for states. Hutchinson clarified it's not about arming all teachers, just specific personnel. The report also suggested safety assessments and a mental health pilot program. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown victim's father, approved of the review. Meanwhile, Congress and states are considering gun control measures, with some focusing on school security and others on banning assault weapons and background checks. Connecticut is advancing a gun control proposal. LaPierre emphasized school security as a priority, comparing it to protection in banks and Congress.

So, the key points are: NRA's push for armed personnel in schools with training, model laws, not arming all teachers, safety assessments, mental health programs, mixed reactions, and the broader context of gun control debates.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main recommendation, mention the training and model law, clarify it's not all teachers, touch on other recommendations, note the context of gun control efforts, and mention LaPierre's emphasis on school security.

Let me make sure it's concise and covers all important aspects without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has recommended that states allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after completing extensive training, following a review prompted by the Newtown mass shooting. While NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre initially called for armed officers in every school, former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the review, emphasized that each school should have at least one armed officer, with decisions made locally. The NRA proposed a 40-60 hour training program and a model state law for armed personnel, clarifying that it does not advocate arming all teachers. The report also suggested safety assessments and a mental health pilot program. Meanwhile, Congress and some states are focusing on gun control measures, including assault weapons bans and background checks, while Connecticut advances a sweeping gun control proposal. LaPierre emphasized school security as a priority, likening it to protection in banks and Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
