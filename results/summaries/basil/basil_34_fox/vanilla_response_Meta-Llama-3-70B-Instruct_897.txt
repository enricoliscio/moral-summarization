SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report recommending that states allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after undergoing extensive training. The report, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow trained personnel to carry weapons. The NRA also calls for schools to conduct safety assessments and for a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The report's release comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans and strengthening background checks. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
