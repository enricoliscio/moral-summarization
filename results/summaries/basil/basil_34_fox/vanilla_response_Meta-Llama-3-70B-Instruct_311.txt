SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a report recommending that states allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. The report, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, had previously called for armed officers in every school, but Hutchinson acknowledged that decisions on school security should be made locally based on budget circumstances. The report also recommends that states require schools to conduct safety assessments and create a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's focus on school security has been criticized by Democrats, who argue that gun control measures are needed to prevent mass shootings. The report's release comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation.
