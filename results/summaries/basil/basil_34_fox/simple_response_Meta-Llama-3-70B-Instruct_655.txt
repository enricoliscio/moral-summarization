SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has called for states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, provided they undergo extensive training. This recommendation comes as part of a review following the Newtown mass shooting, in which 26 people were killed. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, citing that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools should too. The review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law to allow trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's focus on school security has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue that the organization is rejecting gun control measures. Meanwhile, Congress and state legislatures are pursuing gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans.

The NRA's stance is rooted in the moral imperative to protect children and ensure their safety in schools. As LaPierre argued, "The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The organization believes that having "good guys with guns" in schools is the most effective way to prevent tragedies like Newtown.
