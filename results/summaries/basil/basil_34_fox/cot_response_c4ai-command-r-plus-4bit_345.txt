SUMMARY:
The NRA is facing criticism from Democrats for their response to the Newtown mass shooting, where they focused on improving school security instead of advocating for gun control measures. Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the NRA, has proposed arming officers in every school across the country, arguing that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." This proposal has been slightly eased by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, suggesting that the decision to arm officers should be locally made while still emphasizing the importance of having at least one armed officer in every school. Hutchinson has also called for a comprehensive training program for armed officers and proposed a model state law to allow certain trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The NRA's review, applauded by a Newtown victim's father, comes amidst a wave of gun control legislation efforts at the state and federal levels, with many focusing on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks, and restricting access to firearms. Connecticut, home of the Sandy Hook shooting, is leading the way with a sweeping gun control proposal. The NRA continues to advocate for improved school security, arguing that schools deserve the same protection as banks and members of Congress. They believe that assuming responsibility for school safety and investing in absolute protection is paramount to stopping future tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
