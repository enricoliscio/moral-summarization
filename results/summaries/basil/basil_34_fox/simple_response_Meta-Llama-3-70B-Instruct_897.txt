SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more armed officers in schools, as part of a set of recommendations following the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's review, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, calls for a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law that would allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The report also recommends states require schools to conduct safety assessments and create a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." This stance has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue that the NRA is focusing too much on school security and not enough on gun control measures.
