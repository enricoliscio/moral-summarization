Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. The article is about the NRA urging states to allow more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting. I need to make sure I capture all the key points without going over 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main elements. The NRA is making recommendations, specifically about increasing armed personnel in schools after proper training. They've been criticized by Democrats for not focusing on gun control. Wayne LaPierre suggested armed officers in every school, but Asa Hutchinson softened that a bit, saying each school should have at least one but decisions are local. They also proposed a training program and a model law. The report includes other measures like safety assessments and mental health programs. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown parent, supports the effort. Meanwhile, other states are focusing on gun control, and Connecticut is working on a proposal. LaPierre emphasizes school security as a priority.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start with the NRA's call, mention the criticism, Hutchinson's points, the training program, the model law, other recommendations, support from Mattioli, the contrast with other states' approaches, and LaPierre's emphasis on security. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Also, I should check the word count to stay under 200 words. Let me piece this together, ensuring the flow is logical and all key points are included.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after undergoing extensive training, as part of recommendations following the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA faced criticism from Democrats for focusing on school security rather than gun control measures. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre called for armed officers in every school, while former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, emphasized that each school should have at least one armed officer, with decisions made locally. The NRA proposed a 40-60 hour training program and a model state law allowing trained personnel to carry weapons, clarifying that this does not apply to all teachers. The 225-page report also recommended safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a violence indicator. Mark Mattioli, a Newtown shooting victim's father, supported the review. Meanwhile, many states are pursuing gun control legislation, including assault weapons bans and background checks, while Connecticut advanced a sweeping gun control proposal. LaPierre argued that school security should be a top priority, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." END OF SUMMARY.
