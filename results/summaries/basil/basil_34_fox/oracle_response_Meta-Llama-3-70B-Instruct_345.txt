SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) is urging states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, following a weeks-long review after the Newtown mass shooting that killed 26 people. The NRA's recommendations include a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law that would allow certain personnel to carry weapons after undergoing this training. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, argues that improving school security is paramount, saying that schools deserve the same protection as banks and members of Congress. He believes that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's review comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting and expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks, and restricting access to firearms.
