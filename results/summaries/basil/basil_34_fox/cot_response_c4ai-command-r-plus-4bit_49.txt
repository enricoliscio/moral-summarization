SUMMARY:
The NRA is facing criticism from Democrats for its stance on school security following the Newtown mass shooting. The organization has rejected calls for gun control measures and instead focused on improving security in schools. Wayne LaPierre, NRA CEO, has previously called for armed officers to be present in every school across the country, arguing that "the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." In a recent development, the NRA has slightly eased its position by acknowledging that the decision to arm officers in schools should be made locally based on budget considerations. However, they continue to emphasize the importance of having at least one armed officer in every school. The NRA has also proposed a training program for armed officers and a model state law to allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The review comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security while others aim to enact or expand assault weapons bans and strengthen background checks to restrict access to firearms. Mark Mattioli, a father of one Newtown shooting victim, applauded the NRA's efforts. The debate continues between those who believe that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun" and those who advocate for stricter gun control measures to protect our schools and communities.
