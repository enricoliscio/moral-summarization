SUMMARY: In the wake of the Newtown mass shooting that claimed the lives of 26 individuals, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has come under fire for its stance on gun control. CEO Wayne LaPierre has staunchly advocated for armed officers in every school across the country, suggesting that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." The NRA's review, led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, recommends a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law allowing trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. While acknowledging local budget constraints, Hutchinson emphasizes the importance of having at least one armed officer in every school. Mark Mattioli, a father of a Newtown victim, supports the NRA's efforts to improve school security. Despite criticism and a push for gun control legislation by Congress and state legislatures, the NRA maintains that improving school security is paramount to protecting America's children. LaPierre argues that if banks and lawmakers can have protection, schools deserve the same. He asserts that it is time to take responsibility for the safety of our schools and advocates for a plan of "absolute protection."
