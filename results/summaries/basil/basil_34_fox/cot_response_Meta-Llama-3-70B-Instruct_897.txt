SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has urged state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds, following a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that schools across America should be afforded the same "absolute protection" as banks and members of Congress. LaPierre believes that the only way to stop a "monster" from killing children is to be "permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection." The NRA's review proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers and a "model" state law that would allow certain personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. The review also calls for states to require schools to conduct a safety assessment and for a pilot program to assess mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. The NRA's effort comes as Congress and state legislatures pursue gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans.
