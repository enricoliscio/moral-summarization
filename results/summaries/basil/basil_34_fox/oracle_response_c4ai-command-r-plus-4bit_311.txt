SUMMARY: In the wake of the Newtown shooting that killed 26 people, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has been criticized for rejecting gun control measures and focusing on school security. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, previously called for armed officers in every school, and the organization has now released a 225-page report with recommendations to improve school safety. While the NRA still emphasizes the importance of armed officers in schools, it acknowledges that the decision should be made locally. The report also proposes a training program for armed officers and suggests allowing certain trained personnel to carry weapons on school grounds. Additionally, the report calls for mandatory safety assessments and a pilot program to assess mental health as a predictor of violence. Mark Mattioli, a father of one Newtown victim, applauded the review effort. This review comes as Congress and state legislatures debate gun control legislation, with some focusing on school security and others on enacting or expanding bans and strengthening background checks to restrict access to firearms. The state of Connecticut is leading the way with a sweeping gun control proposal likely to be approved. The NRA's LaPierre argues that improving school security and protection is paramount, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
