Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The article is about the NRA's recommendations post-Newtown shooting, focusing on increasing armed personnel in schools. The user has specified certain morally charged words that must be included: carry, shooting, rejecting, measures, killed, approved, enacting, expanding, bans, strengthening, restrict, improving, killing, protection, stops.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The NRA is urging states to allow more armed officers in schools after the Newtown shooting, which killed 26 people. They want extensive training for these officers. The author mentions criticism from Democrats for not focusing on gun control. The NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, wants armed officers in every school, but Asa Hutchinson, leading the review, suggests at least one per school, with a training program. They also propose a model law for armed personnel, not all teachers. The report includes other measures like safety assessments and mental health programs. Some states are enacting gun control measures, while Connecticut is advancing a sweeping proposal. LaPierre argues that schools need protection like banks and Congress.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral words. I'll start by stating the NRA's call for armed personnel after the shooting. Mention the 26 killed, their training, and the model law. Note the criticism for rejecting gun control. Include Hutchinson's comments on local decisions and the training program. Mention the other recommendations like safety assessments and mental health. Highlight the state actions on gun control and LaPierre's argument about protection. End with the moral framing that a good guy with a gun stops a bad one.

I should ensure all the specified words are included where appropriate. Let me structure the summary step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions or extra information beyond what's in the article, keeping it factual while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The NRA has called for states to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after the Newtown shooting, which killed 26 people. The organization proposed extensive training for armed officers and a model law for states, emphasizing that teachers should focus on teaching, not carrying guns. While the NRA faced criticism for rejecting gun control measures, its review suggested that every school should have at least one armed officer, with decisions made locally. The report also recommended safety assessments and mental health programs. Meanwhile, states like South Dakota have approved legislation allowing armed teachers, while others are enacting or expanding gun control measures, such as assault weapons bans and background checks. Connecticut is advancing a sweeping gun control proposal. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre argued that improving school security is paramount, stating that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." END OF SUMMARY.
