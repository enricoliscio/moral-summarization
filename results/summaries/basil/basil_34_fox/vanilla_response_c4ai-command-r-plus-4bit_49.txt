SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the Newtown mass shooting, has called on state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds after undergoing extensive training. This recommendation comes after initial criticism of the NRA's focus on school security rather than gun control measures. While the NRA previously advocated for armed officers in every school, the review led by former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson eases off this stance, acknowledging local budget constraints. Hutchinson proposes a training program for armed officers and suggests a model state law to allow trained personnel to carry weapons in schools. The report also emphasizes the need for safety assessments and mental health evaluations as indicators for violence. Mark Mattioli, a father of a Newtown victim, supports the review's efforts. The NRA's stance on improving school security contrasts with the push for gun control legislation in Congress and state legislatures, with some focusing on school security and others on restricting access to firearms. Connecticut is the latest state to advance a sweeping gun control proposal. The NRA argues that schools should have the same protection as banks and members of Congress, and that "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." END OF SUMMARY.
