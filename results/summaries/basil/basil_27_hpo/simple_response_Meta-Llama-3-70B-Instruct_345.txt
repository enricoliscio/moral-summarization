SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in markets with large Jewish communities in Florida, with a total budget of $1 million. The ad is seen as an attempt to influence the US presidential election, with Republicans using it to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel and his stance on Iran. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, stating that he will not be drawn into the US election and that Obama has expressed determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad is implicitly critical of the Obama administration, despite Secure America Now's claim to represent all political ideologies. The moral framing of this article suggests that Secure America Now's actions are hypocritical and misleading, and that Netanyahu's attempts to stay out of the US election are being undermined by partisan politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
