SUMMARY:
Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in markets with large Jewish communities, implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu and his handling of Iran, echoing Republican accusations that Obama has been "dismissive" of Israel and its security concerns. Netanyahu, however, pushed back against being drawn into US politics, rejecting the notion that Obama had "thrown Israel under a bus." He also appreciated and respected Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This ad adds to Secure America Now's previous attacks on Obama, despite the group's claim to represent all political ideologies. The $1 million ad buy underscores the GOP's *narrative* of Obama's alleged *dismissiveness* towards Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
