SUMMARY:
Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, despite Netanyahu's recent pushback against being drawn into US election-year politicking. The ad adds to the GOP's narrative that the Obama administration is dismissive of Israel, with Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney repeatedly accusing the president of not taking a firm stance against Iran. Netanyahu, however, has rejected these criticisms, expressing his appreciation and respect for Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This latest ad campaign underscores the moral framing of security, respect, and determination in the complex political landscape of US-Israel relations and election-year strategies.
