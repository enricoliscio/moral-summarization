Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Bibi Netanyahu being featured in a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group. The ad is part of election-year politicking, which Netanyahu had recently criticized. The ad is running in areas with large Jewish communities in Florida, targeting the Republican base.

The ad focuses on Israel's security concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program. Republicans are using this to criticize Obama's stance on Iran, suggesting he's not firm enough. Romney has accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus." The ad seems to support this narrative.

Netanyahu, however, is trying to stay neutral, saying he doesn't want to get involved in U.S. politics. He also clarifies that the scheduling conflict, not a refusal, caused the meeting cancellation. He appreciates Obama's commitment to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons.

Secure America Now has run similar ads before, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The latest ad doesn't name Obama but aligns with the GOP's narrative, implying Obama isn't supportive of Israel.

I need to capture the moral framing: the ad is part of political strategy to influence the election, using Israel's security as a tool. Netanyahu's resistance to being a pawn adds another layer, showing the tension between politics and diplomacy.

I'll structure the summary to include the ad's purpose, its targets, Netanyahu's response, and the underlying political strategy. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while highlighting the moral aspects of using foreign policy for domestic politics.

SUMMARY:  
Bibi Netanyahu, despite criticizing the use of his name in U.S. election politics, has become the subject of a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group. The ad, airing in Florida's Jewish communities, highlights Israel's concerns over Iran's nuclear program, aligning with Republican criticism of President Obama's stance on Iran. Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have accused Obama of being too lenient with Iran and "throwing Israel under a bus." Netanyahu, however, has distanced himself from the political fray, denying involvement in U.S. elections and clarifying that scheduling conflicts, not a refusal, caused the meeting cancellation with Obama. He also expressed appreciation for Obama's commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The ad, part of a broader strategy by Secure America Now to influence the election narrative, implicitly supports the GOP's portrayal of Obama as dismissive of Israel's concerns. This marks the latest in a series of political maneuvers using Israel's security as a tool in U.S. domestic politics.  
END OF SUMMARY.
