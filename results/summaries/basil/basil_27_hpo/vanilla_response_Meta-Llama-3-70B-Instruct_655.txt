SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, areas with large Jewish communities, and is part of a $1 million media flight. The ad is seen as an attempt to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, and is critical of President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. However, Netanyahu has recently pushed back against criticisms that he is taking sides in the US election, saying he will not be drawn into the American election and appreciating Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad from Secure America Now targeting Obama, with a previous ad accusing him of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.

END OF SUMMARY.
