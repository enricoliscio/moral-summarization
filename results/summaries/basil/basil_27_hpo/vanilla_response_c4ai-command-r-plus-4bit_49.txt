SUMMARY: A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities and is part of an effort to influence the American election. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has criticized the Obama administration for its stance on Iran and its relationship with Israel. Netanyahu has pushed back against being drawn into the election, denying reports that Obama refused to meet with him. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama, despite the group claiming to represent all political ideologies. The ad implicitly supports the GOP's narrative that Obama has not been supportive enough of Israel.
END OF SUMMARY.
