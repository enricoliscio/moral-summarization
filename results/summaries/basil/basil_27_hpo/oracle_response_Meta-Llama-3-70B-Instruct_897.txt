SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, despite his recent denouncement of using his name in election-year politicking. The ad, airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, targets President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, implying that he has been dismissive of Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. This narrative is in line with Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's attacks on Obama, claiming he has "thrown Israel under a bus" by not taking a firm enough stance against Iran. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, stating that Obama is "determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons" and that there is no truth to the claim that Obama has thrown Israel under a bus. The ad is part of a larger effort to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, with Secure America Now having released a similar ad in July accusing Obama of embarking on a so-called "apology tour" at the expense of American security.
