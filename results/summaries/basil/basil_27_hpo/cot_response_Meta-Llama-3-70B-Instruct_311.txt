SUMMARY:
A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign in Florida featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, highlighting Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is seen as an attempt to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, particularly in relation to President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have repeatedly criticized Obama for being too soft on Iran and "throwing Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, saying he respects Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and that there is no evidence of Obama being "dismissive" of Israel's concerns. The ad is seen as part of a larger narrative by Republicans to portray Obama as weak on national security and foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
