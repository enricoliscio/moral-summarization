SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign in Florida, featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu expressing concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad aims to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, and is seen as a thinly veiled attack on President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. The move is hypocritical, as Netanyahu recently denied being drawn into the American election and praised Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad is part of a larger GOP narrative that Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus" and is soft on Iran. However, Netanyahu has rejected this characterization, saying "there is no bus." The ad is a clear example of election-year politicking, and Secure America Now's claim to represent all political ideologies rings hollow.

END OF SUMMARY.
