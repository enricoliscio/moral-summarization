Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Bibi Netanyahu and a new ad by Secure America Now. They're a neoconservative group focused on US security and foreign policy. The ad is running in Florida, targeting Jewish communities, and it's about Israel's concerns with Iran's nuclear program. Republicans are using this to criticize Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. Romney has been saying Obama isn't firm enough on Iran and has thrown Israel under the bus. 

Netanyahu, though, is pushing back. He says he doesn't want to get involved in US elections and clarifies that the scheduling conflict, not Obama refusing, caused the meeting cancellation. He also appreciates Obama's stance on preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The group has run similar ads before, even though they claim to represent all political ideologies. The current ad doesn't name Obama but supports the GOP's narrative.

So, the key points are: the ad by Secure America Now, its purpose to criticize Obama via Netanyahu's security concerns, the ad's targets, Netanyahu's response, and the group's past actions. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the ad, its context, Netanyahu's reaction, and the group's background.
