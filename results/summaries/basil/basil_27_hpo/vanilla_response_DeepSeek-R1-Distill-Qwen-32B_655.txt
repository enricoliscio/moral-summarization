Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about an ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group, featuring Bibi Netanyahu. The ad is part of election-year politicking, targeting Obama's stance on Israel and Iran. It's airing in Florida, where there are large Jewish communities. The ad mentions Netanyahu's concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which Republicans are using against Obama. Romney has criticized Obama for not being firm enough on Iran, saying he threw Israel under the bus. Netanyahu, though, has pushed back, saying he doesn't want to get involved in U.S. elections and clarifying that the meeting conflict was a scheduling issue, not Obama refusing. Secure America Now has run similar ads before, attacking Obama's policies. The ad doesn't name Obama but supports the GOP narrative about Obama's relationship with Israel.

So, the key points are: the ad by Secure America Now, targeting Obama's foreign policy, airing in Florida, using Netanyahu's comments, Romney's criticism, Netanyahu's pushback, and the group's previous ads. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should structure it to mention the ad, the context of U.S. elections, the focus on Obama's Iran policy, the regions it's airing, Netanyahu's involvement, Romney's criticism, Netanyahu's response, and the group's past actions. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A neoconservative group, Secure America Now, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, targeting President Obama's foreign policy on Iran. The ad, airing in Florida's Jewish communities, highlights Netanyahu's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program, a point Republicans use to criticize Obama's stance. Republican nominee Mitt Romney has accused Obama of not being firm enough on Iran, even suggesting Obama "threw Israel under a bus." Netanyahu, however, has distanced himself from the U.S. election, denying involvement and clarifying that a scheduling conflict, not Obama, caused the meeting cancellation. Secure America Now, which claims to represent all political ideologies, has previously run ads attacking Obama's policies, though the latest ad does not name him, subtly supporting GOP narratives on Obama's relationship with Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
