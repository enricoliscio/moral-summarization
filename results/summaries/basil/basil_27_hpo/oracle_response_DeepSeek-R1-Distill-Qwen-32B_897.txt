Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally framed words: thrown, dismissive, determined, expense. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about an ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama's foreign policy, specifically regarding Israel and Iran. The ad is part of election-year politicking, and there's criticism from Republicans, including Romney, about Obama's stance on Israel.

I should make sure to include the morally charged words. For example, Romney accuses Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus," which is a strong moral statement. The article also mentions the GOP painting Obama as "dismissive" of Israel, so that's another key term. 

Netanyahu's response is important too. He rejects the "thrown" accusation and clarifies the meeting situation, so I'll include that. The ad implicitly supports the GOP narrative, which ties into the "expense" of American security. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll structure it by mentioning the ad, the accusations, Netanyahu's response, and the implications for the election. 

Let me piece this together, ensuring each moral term is included and the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: A neoconservative nonprofit, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, targeting Jewish communities in Florida. The ad highlights Israel’s security concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, aligning with Republican criticism of President Obama’s "frosty" relationship with Netanyahu. Republican nominee Mitt Romney has accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus" for not taking a firm stance against Iran. The GOP has also criticized Obama for declining a meeting with Netanyahu at the UN, painting him as "dismissive" of Israel’s concerns. Netanyahu, however, rejected these accusations, stating, "There is no bus," and emphasized Obama’s commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This ad is part of a broader effort by Secure America Now to influence the election narrative, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The campaign underscores the GOP’s narrative that Obama’s policies have come at the "expense" of American security and Israel’s interests. END OF SUMMARY.
