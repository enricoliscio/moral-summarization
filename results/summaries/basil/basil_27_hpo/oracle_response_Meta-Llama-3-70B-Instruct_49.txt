SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, despite his recent denial of being involved in election-year politicking. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, highlights Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program, a topic Republicans have used to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. The ad implies that Obama's administration is dismissive of Israel's concerns, a narrative that has been pushed by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has rejected these criticisms, stating that Obama is "determined" to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and that there is "no bus." The ad is part of a larger effort to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, with Secure America Now having released a previous ad accusing Obama of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.

END OF SUMMARY.
