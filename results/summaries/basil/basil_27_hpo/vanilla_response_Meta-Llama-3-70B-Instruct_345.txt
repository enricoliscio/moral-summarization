SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign in Florida featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad aims to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, particularly in regards to the Obama administration's relationship with Israel. This comes despite Netanyahu's recent statements denying involvement in US election-year politicking. The ad is seen as a way to support Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's claims that President Barack Obama has not taken a firm enough stance against Iran and has "thrown Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, saying he respects Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama, with a previous ad accusing the president of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.

END OF SUMMARY.
