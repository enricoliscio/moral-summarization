SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, despite Netanyahu's recent denial of involvement in election-year politicking. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, highlights Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which Republicans have used to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. The ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative that Obama has been "dismissive" of Israel's concerns and has not taken a firm enough stance against Iran. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, stating that Obama is "determined" to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and that he respects this stance. The ad is seen as an attempt to sway public opinion at the "expense" of the Obama administration, which has been accused of embarking on a so-called "apology tour" at the expense of American security. Netanyahu has denied being "thrown" into the American election, and the White House has also denied reports that Obama refused a meeting with Netanyahu due to a scheduling conflict.

END OF SUMMARY.
