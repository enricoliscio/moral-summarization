SUMMARY:
Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, is part of a $1 million campaign to influence American foreign policy debate ahead of the election. It implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, despite Netanyahu's efforts to stay out of US politics. Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have *attacked* Obama for his handling of Iran and for his allegedly *frosty* relationship with Netanyahu, claiming the president has *thrown* Israel "under a bus." Netanyahu, however, has *pushed back* against these criticisms, *rejecting* reports that Obama *refused* a meeting with him. He *appreciates* and *respects* Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now to criticize Obama's foreign policy, despite the group's claim to represent all political ideologies.
END OF SUMMARY.
