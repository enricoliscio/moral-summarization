SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, despite Netanyahu's recent denouncement of using his name in election-year politicking. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, highlights Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which Republicans have used to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, stating that he won't be drawn into the American election and that Obama has not "thrown Israel under a bus." Netanyahu has also expressed appreciation for Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative that Obama has been dismissive of Israel's concerns, and that his policies have come at the expense of American security. This is not the first ad from Secure America Now targeting Obama, with a previous ad accusing him of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.

END OF SUMMARY.
