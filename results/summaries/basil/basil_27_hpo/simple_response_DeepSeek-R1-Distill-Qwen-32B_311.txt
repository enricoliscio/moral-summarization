Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying tone.

The article talks about Bibi Netanyahu being featured in a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group. The ad is part of election-year politicking, which Netanyahu himself criticized. The ad is running in Florida, targeting Jewish communities, and it's about Israel's security concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program. Republicans are using this to criticize Obama's stance on Iran and his relationship with Netanyahu. Romney has been attacking Obama for not being firm enough against Iran and for not meeting Netanyahu at the UN, implying Obama is dismissive of Israel.

Netanyahu, however, is pushing back against these criticisms. He's saying he doesn't want to get involved in the American election and clarifies that the scheduling conflict was the reason for not meeting Obama, not a refusal. He appreciates Obama's commitment to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The article also mentions that Secure America Now has run similar ads before, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The latest ad doesn't name Obama but supports the GOP narrative against him.

The moral framing here seems to be about the integrity of political campaigns and the use of foreign policy issues for domestic political gain. There's a critique of using Netanyahu's name in U.S. elections and the implication that Secure America Now is biased despite claiming neutrality. Also, the article suggests that the ads are part of a broader strategy to undermine Obama's image regarding Israel.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points succinctly, highlighting the ad's purpose, the political strategy, Netanyahu's response, and the critique of the organization's neutrality. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective on political manipulation and bias.

Let me structure the summary: start with the ad by Secure America Now targeting Jewish communities, its purpose to criticize Obama's Iran policy. Mention the funding and the political angle. Then, note Netanyahu's criticism of being used in U.S. politics and his clarification about the meeting. Highlight the organization's past actions and the implicit criticism of Obama. Conclude with the critique of their neutrality.

I should ensure the summary flows well and sticks to the main points without getting too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and concise, making sure the moral aspects are evident.

SUMMARY:  
A new ad by neoconservative group Secure America Now features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, aiming to influence U.S. election debates by highlighting Israel's concerns over Iran's nuclear program. The ad, costing up to $1 million, targets Jewish communities in Florida. Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have criticized President Obama for a "frosty" relationship with Netanyahu, accusing him of not taking a firm stance against Iran. Netanyahu, however, has rejected being drawn into U.S. politics, clarifying that scheduling conflicts, not a refusal, caused the missed UN meeting with Obama. He also dismissed claims that Obama "threw Israel under a bus," stating, "There is no bus." Secure America Now, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies, has previously run ads attacking Obama's foreign policy. The latest ad implicitly supports the GOP narrative of Obama's dismissive stance toward Israel, raising questions about the group's neutrality in U.S. politics.  
END OF SUMMARY.
