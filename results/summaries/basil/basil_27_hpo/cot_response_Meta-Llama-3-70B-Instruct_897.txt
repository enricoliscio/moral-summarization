SUMMARY:
A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu highlighting Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, areas with large Jewish communities. The ad is seen as an attack on President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, which Republicans have characterized as "frosty". Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has repeatedly accused Obama of not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming the president has "thrown Israel under a bus". However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, saying he "respects" and "appreciates" Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative on Obama's relationship with Israel, portraying him as "dismissive" of Israel's concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
