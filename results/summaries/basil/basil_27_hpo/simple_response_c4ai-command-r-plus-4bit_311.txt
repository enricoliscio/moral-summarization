SUMMARY: Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel and his stance on Iran. This comes despite Netanyahu's pushback against being drawn into US politics, where he defended Obama's commitment to preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. The ad adds to Secure America Now's previous efforts to undermine Obama's foreign policy, including an earlier ad accusing him of an "apology tour." The group's actions highlight the moral dilemma of using foreign policy and national security for political gain, especially when it involves sensitive issues like the US-Israel relationship and the Iranian nuclear threat.

END OF SUMMARY.
