SUMMARY: A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in markets with large Jewish communities in Florida, implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, despite Netanyahu's pushback against politicizing his name. The ad aligns with Republican attacks on the Obama administration for not taking a firm stance against Iran and for being dismissive of Israel's concerns. The GOP has also accused the president of throwing Israel "under a bus." Netanyahu, however, rejected these criticisms, denying any scheduling conflict and appreciating Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This isn't the first time Secure America Now has targeted Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. Their previous ad accused the president of an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.
END OF SUMMARY.
