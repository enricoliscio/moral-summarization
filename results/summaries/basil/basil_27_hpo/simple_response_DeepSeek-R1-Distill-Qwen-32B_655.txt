Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about an ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. 

First, I should identify the main points. The ad is part of election-year politics, using Netanyahu's name despite his objections. It's running in areas with large Jewish communities, which is strategic. The ad focuses on Iran's nuclear program and criticizes Obama's stance. Romney has been using similar attacks. Netanyahu denied being involved in the American election and defended Obama's commitment to Israel's security. The organization's previous ad criticized Obama's "apology tour." The ad doesn't name Obama but supports the GOP narrative.

Now, I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral aspects. The moral framing involves using foreign policy issues in domestic politics, which could be seen as manipulative. The ad is part of a broader strategy to influence voters, possibly exploiting concerns about Israel's security. Also, the fact that Netanyahu is being used despite his objections adds a moral layer about respecting political boundaries.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points: the ad's purpose, its target areas, the content, Romney's role, Netanyahu's response, the organization's past actions, and the implicit criticism of Obama. I'll need to ensure each point is clear and flows logically without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns over Iran's nuclear program. The ad, costing up to $1 million, is airing in Florida areas with large Jewish communities. It aligns with Republican criticism of President Barack Obama's handling of U.S.-Israel relations, particularly Romney's claim that Obama "threw Israel under a bus." Netanyahu, however, has distanced himself from the American election, denying involvement and defending Obama's commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The ad is part of a broader GOP narrative criticizing Obama's foreign policy, despite Secure America Now claiming to represent all political ideologies. The organization previously ran an ad accusing Obama of an "apology tour," and while this latest ad does not name Obama, it implicitly supports Republican claims of his dismissiveness toward Israel.  

END OF SUMMARY.
