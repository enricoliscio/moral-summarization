SUMMARY: In the lead-up to the US election, a neoconservative nonprofit, Secure America Now, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in markets with large Jewish communities, implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama for his handling of the US-Israel relationship and suggests that he has thrown Israel "under a bus." Netanyahu, however, has pushed back against being drawn into US politics, denying reports of a scheduling conflict with Obama and expressing appreciation for the president's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This isn't the first time Secure America Now has targeted Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. Previously, they accused him of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security. The latest ad underscores the GOP's narrative of Obama being dismissive of Israel and its security concerns.
END OF SUMMARY.
