SUMMARY: A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities and is part of a $1 million media campaign. The ad aligns with Republican criticism of President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel and his handling of Iran. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has accused Obama of not taking a strong enough stance against Iran and "throwing Israel under a bus." The ad comes despite Netanyahu's recent pushback against being drawn into US election politics. Netanyahu has rejected reports of a refused meeting request with Obama, citing scheduling conflicts instead. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama's foreign policy, despite the organization claiming to represent all political ideologies. 

END OF SUMMARY.
