SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu expressing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, aiming to influence the US presidential election. The move is seen as a Republican effort to undermine President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, a narrative that has been pushed by GOP nominee Mitt Romney. However, Netanyahu has recently rejected attempts to draw him into the US election, stating that Obama has committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons and that there is no evidence of the president "throwing Israel under a bus." Despite this, the ad perpetuates the GOP's narrative, implicitly criticizing the Obama administration's stance on Israel. The ad is part of a larger effort by Secure America Now to sway public opinion on US security and foreign policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
