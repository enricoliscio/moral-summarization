Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article talks about Bibi Netanyahu being featured in a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group. They're targeting areas with large Jewish communities, spending around $400k so far. The ad is about Israel's security concerns with Iran's nuclear program. Republicans are using this to criticize Obama's stance on Iran, saying he's too soft. Mitt Romney has accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus." 

Netanyahu, though, is trying to stay out of the election, saying he won't let them drag him into it. He also clarifies that the scheduling conflict, not Obama, is why they didn't meet. He appreciates Obama's determination to stop Iran's nuclear weapons. 

Secure America Now has run similar ads before, attacking Obama's policies, even though they claim to represent all political ideologies. The latest ad doesn't name Obama but supports the GOP's narrative of Obama being dismissive of Israel.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again. Words like "decried," "criticize," "accusing," "dismissive," "apology tour," "frosty," "firm enough stance," "threw Israel under a bus," "appreciate," "respect," "pushing," "attack line," "embarking," "so-called," "narrative," "closest ally." These all carry moral connotations.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key points: the ad by Secure America Now, the spending, targeting Jewish areas, the message about Iran, Republican criticism of Obama, Romney's accusations, Netanyahu's pushback, and the ongoing narrative from the GOP.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the ad, then the criticism, Netanyahu's response, and the group's previous actions. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is important. I'll also ensure that the moral framing is preserved by using those key terms.
