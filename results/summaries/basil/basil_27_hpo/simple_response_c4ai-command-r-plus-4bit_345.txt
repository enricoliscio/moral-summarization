SUMMARY: Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, is running an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu in several Florida markets with large Jewish populations. The ad, which cost $1 million, is part of a campaign to influence the American election by highlighting Netanyahu's concerns about Iran's nuclear program and the Obama administration's allegedly lukewarm relationship with Israel. This is not the first time Secure America Now has targeted President Obama, despite the organization's claim to represent all political ideologies. In response to the ad, Netanyahu has distanced himself from the US election, denying that Obama threw Israel "under the bus." Netanyahu's pushback against being drawn into American politics is a moral stance against manipulative and divisive electioneering. He upholds the integrity of the political process by refusing to be a pawn in the political game.

END OF SUMMARY.
