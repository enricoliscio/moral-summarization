SUMMARY: A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program, implicitly criticizing President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. The ad, airing in markets with large Jewish communities, aligns with Republican efforts to paint the Obama administration as dismissive of Israel's security concerns. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against politicizing his name, denying that Obama refused a meeting request and expressing his appreciation for Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Secure America Now previously ran an ad accusing Obama of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security. The latest ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative of Obama's handling of the US-Israel relationship.
END OF SUMMARY.
