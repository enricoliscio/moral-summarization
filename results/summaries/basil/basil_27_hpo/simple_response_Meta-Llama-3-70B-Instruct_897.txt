SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, targeting Jewish communities in Florida. The ad highlights Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which Republicans have used to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. However, Netanyahu recently rejected attempts to draw him into the American election, stating that he respects Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Despite this, the ad implicitly perpetuates the GOP's narrative that Obama has a frosty relationship with Israel. This is not the first time Secure America Now has run an ad against Obama, with a previous ad accusing him of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security. The moral framing of this article suggests that Secure America Now's actions are hypocritical and misleading, as they claim to represent all political ideologies while promoting a partisan agenda.
