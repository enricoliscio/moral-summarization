SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is featured in a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, features Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, echoing Republican attacks on Obama for not taking a strong enough stance against Iran and for his alleged dismissal of Netanyahu. Netanyahu, however, has pushed back against being drawn into US election politics, rejecting the notion that Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus." This isn't the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama's foreign policy, despite the group's claim to represent all political ideologies. The ad buy is reported to ultimately cost $1 million.
END OF SUMMARY.
