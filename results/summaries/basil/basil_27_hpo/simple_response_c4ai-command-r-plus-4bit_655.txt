SUMMARY: Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, is running an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu in Florida markets with large Jewish populations. The ad, costing $1 million, highlights Netanyahu's concerns about Iran's nuclear program and implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. While Republicans have used this issue to attack Obama, Netanyahu himself has pushed back against being drawn into US politics, rejecting the notion that Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus." This isn't the first time Secure America Now has targeted Obama with ads, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The ad campaign underscores the GOP's narrative of Obama's alleged dismissiveness towards Israel and its security concerns. 

END OF SUMMARY.
