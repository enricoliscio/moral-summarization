SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, which have large Jewish communities, and is part of a $1 million media campaign. The ad is seen as an effort to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, particularly in the context of the presidential election. The ad's message is similar to that of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has criticized President Barack Obama's stance on Iran and his relationship with Israel. However, Netanyahu has recently pushed back against these criticisms, stating that he is not taking sides in the American election and that Obama has expressed determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
