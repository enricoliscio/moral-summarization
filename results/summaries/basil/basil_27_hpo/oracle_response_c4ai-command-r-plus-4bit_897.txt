SUMMARY: A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have accused Obama of being dismissive of Israel and not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming he has "thrown Israel under a bus." Netanyahu, however, has pushed back against these criticisms, denying reports of a scheduling conflict with Obama and respecting the president's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This isn't the first time Secure America Now has run ads against Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The group previously accused the president of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.
END OF SUMMARY.
