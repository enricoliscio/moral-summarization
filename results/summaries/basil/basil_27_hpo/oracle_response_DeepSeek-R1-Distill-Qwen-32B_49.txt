Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user mentioned that the author used words like "thrown," "dismissive," "determined," and "expense." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group, featuring Netanyahu talking about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is part of the election-year politicking, targeting Obama's stance on Israel. Republicans, including Romney, have criticized Obama for not being firm enough against Iran and for being dismissive of Israel. Netanyahu, however, is trying to stay out of the U.S. election and clarifies that Obama is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad doesn't mention Obama by name but supports the GOP narrative.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words. I'll start by mentioning the ad and its purpose, then the criticism from Republicans, the use of the word "thrown" by Romney, and Netanyahu's pushback. I'll include how the ad implicitly supports the GOP narrative and mention the words "determined" and "expense" as used by the author.

I should structure it clearly, ensuring each sentence flows logically. I need to check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, I should make sure the summary captures the essence without losing the moral framing. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY:  
A neoconservative group, Secure America Now, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, highlighting Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida, aims to influence the U.S. election by criticizing President Obama's stance on Israel, with Republicans accusing him of being "dismissive" of Israel's concerns. Mitt Romney has claimed Obama "threw Israel under a bus" for not taking a firmer line against Iran. Netanyahu, however, has rejected being drawn into the election, stating, "I know that people are trying to draw me into the American election. Iâ€™m not going to do that." He also clarified that Obama is "determined" to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, dismissing claims Obama refused a meeting as a scheduling conflict. The ad, while not mentioning Obama by name, aligns with the GOP narrative that Obama's policies come at the "expense" of Israel's security. This is not the first time Secure America Now has targeted Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. END OF SUMMARY.
