SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has recently been the subject of a new ad campaign by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, features Netanyahu expressing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. This ad campaign comes as Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has been criticizing the Obama administration for its handling of the US-Israel relationship, including accusations that President Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against being drawn into US election politics, rejecting the idea that Obama has dismissed Israel's concerns. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama, despite the organization's claim to represent all political ideologies. The latest ad implicitly supports the GOP's narrative of Obama's relationship with Israel, but does not mention the administration by name.
END OF SUMMARY.
