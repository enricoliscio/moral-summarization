SUMMARY:
A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, despite his recent denouncement of using his name in election-year politicking. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, highlights Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which Republicans have used to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. The ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative that Obama has been "frosty" towards Israel and has "thrown it under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, rejecting reports that Obama refused his request for a meeting and appreciating the president's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad Secure America Now has run against Obama, with a previous ad accusing the president of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security. END OF SUMMARY.
