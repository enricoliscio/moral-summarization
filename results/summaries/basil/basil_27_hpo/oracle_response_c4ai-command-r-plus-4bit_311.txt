SUMMARY: Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. This ad campaign, targeting Jewish communities in Florida, aligns with Republican efforts to paint President Barack Obama as dismissive of Israel and its security concerns. The GOP has criticized Obama for not taking a firm stance against Iran and for declining a meeting with Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against being drawn into US politics, rejecting the notion that Obama "threw Israel under a bus." This ad adds to Secure America Now's previous attacks on Obama, despite the group claiming to represent all political ideologies. The ad implicitly supports the GOP's narrative of Obama's handling of the US-Israel relationship, suggesting a lack of determination to protect American security interests.
END OF SUMMARY.
