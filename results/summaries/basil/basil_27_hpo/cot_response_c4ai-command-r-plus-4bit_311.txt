SUMMARY:
Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, is part of a $1 million campaign to influence the American election. It implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, a narrative the GOP has been pushing. Netanyahu, however, has pushed back against being drawn into the election, rejecting reports that Obama refused a meeting and stating that the President has not "thrown Israel under a bus." This ad campaign adds to Secure America Now's previous efforts to criticize the Obama administration, despite the organization's claim to represent all political ideologies. 

END OF SUMMARY.
