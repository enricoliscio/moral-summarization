SUMMARY: A neoconservative nonprofit, Secure America Now, is running an ad in Florida markets with large Jewish populations that features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu laying out his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is part of a $1 million campaign and aligns with Republican attacks on President Barack Obama for his handling of US-Israel relations and his alleged failure to take a strong stance against Iran. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against being drawn into US election politics, rejecting the notion that Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus." This isn't the first time Secure America Now has targeted Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The ad implicitly criticizes the Obama administration's relationship with Israel, contributing to the GOP's narrative.
END OF SUMMARY.
