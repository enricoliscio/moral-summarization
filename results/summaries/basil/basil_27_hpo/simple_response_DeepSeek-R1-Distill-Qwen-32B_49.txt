Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article talks about an ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group, featuring Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program. The ad is part of election-year politicking, targeting Jewish communities in Florida. It's being used by Republicans to criticize Obama's stance on Israel, with Romney accusing Obama of not being firm enough against Iran and even "throwing Israel under a bus."

Netanyahu, however, is trying to stay neutral, saying he doesn't want to get involved in American politics. He also clarifies that the scheduling conflict, not a refusal, caused the meeting cancellation. The article mentions that this isn't the first time Secure America Now has run ads against Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The ad implicitly supports the GOP narrative against Obama's handling of relations with Israel.

Now, considering the moral framing, the article seems critical of the ad's use in election politics, suggesting it's manipulative. It also questions the group's neutrality since they're consistently targeting Obama. The moral angle here is about the integrity of political discourse and the manipulation of foreign policy issues for domestic political gain.

I need to ensure the summary captures these elements: the ad's purpose, the criticism of Obama, Netanyahu's stance, the group's past actions, and the moral critique of using foreign policy for political gain. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ending with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A neoconservative group, Secure America Now, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's concerns over Iran's nuclear program, targeting Jewish communities in Florida. The ad is part of election-year politicking, with Republicans using it to criticize President Obama's relationship with Israel, accusing him of not taking a firm stance against Iran. Republican nominee Mitt Romney has claimed Obama "threw Israel under a bus," while the GOP has also criticized Obama for declining a meeting with Netanyahu at the UN. Netanyahu, however, has distanced himself from the election, stating he won't be drawn into American politics and clarifying that the meeting cancellation was due to scheduling conflicts. This isn't the first time Secure America Now has run ads against Obama, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies. The ad implicitly supports the GOP narrative of Obama's dismissive stance toward Israel, highlighting the moral critique of using foreign policy issues for political gain. END OF SUMMARY.
