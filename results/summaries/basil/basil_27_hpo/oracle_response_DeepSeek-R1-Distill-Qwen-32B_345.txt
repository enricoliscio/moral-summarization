Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: "thrown," "dismissive," "determined," and "expense." The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about a new ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama's foreign policy, particularly regarding Israel and Iran. The ad features Netanyahu discussing security concerns, and Republicans are using this to criticize Obama's stance. Romney has accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus." Netanyahu denied being involved in U.S. politics and said Obama is "determined" to prevent Iran's nuclear weapons. The ad doesn't mention Obama by name but supports the GOP narrative that Obama is dismissive of Israel's concerns.

I need to include the moral words. So, I'll mention Romney's accusation using "thrown," describe Obama as "determined," and note the ad's implication that Obama is "dismissive" of Israel's needs. Also, the ad's purpose is to highlight the "expense" of Obama's policies on American security.

Putting it all together, the summary should mention the ad, its purpose, Netanyahu's response, Romney's criticism, and the moral framing. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and concise, keeping it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: A new ad by neoconservative group Secure America Now features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iranâ€™s nuclear program, targeting President Obama's foreign policy. Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have accused Obama of "throwing Israel under a bus" for not taking a firmer stance against Iran. Netanyahu denied involvement in U.S. election politicking, stating he respects Obama's "determined" commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The ad, which has cost around $400,000 so far, aims to highlight the "expense" of Obama's policies on American security, implicitly supporting the GOP narrative that the administration is dismissive of Israel's concerns. Secure America Now, despite claiming to represent all political ideologies, has previously run similar ads criticizing Obama. END OF SUMMARY.
