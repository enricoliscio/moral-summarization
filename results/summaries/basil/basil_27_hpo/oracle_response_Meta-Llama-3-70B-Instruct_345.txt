SUMMARY:

A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in markets with large Jewish communities in Florida, with a total budget of $1 million. The ad is seen as an attempt to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, particularly in relation to President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Obama for being "dismissive" of Israel's concerns, claiming he has "thrown Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, saying he respects Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative on Obama's relationship with Israel, suggesting that his actions are at the "expense" of American security. Despite Netanyahu's denials, the ad is seen as an attempt to influence the election-year politicking.

END OF SUMMARY.
