SUMMARY:
Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit, has released an ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad, airing in Florida markets with large Jewish communities, is part of a $1 million campaign to influence the American election. It implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, despite Netanyahu's pushback against being drawn into US politics. The ad builds on Republican nominee Mitt Romney's attacks on the Obama administration for its supposed softness on Iran and its alleged dismissal of Netanyahu's requests for a meeting, claiming Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus." Netanyahu, however, rejected these criticisms, expressing his *appreciation* and *respect* for Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This ad campaign highlights the GOP's narrative of Obama's handling of US-Israel relations, even as Netanyahu refutes any suggestion of a strained relationship.
