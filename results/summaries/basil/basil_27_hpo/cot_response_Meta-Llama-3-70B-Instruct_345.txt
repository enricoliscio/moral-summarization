SUMMARY:
A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, areas with large Jewish communities. This move is seen as an attempt to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, particularly in the context of the presidential election. Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have repeatedly targeted President Barack Obama's relationship with Netanyahu, claiming he has been "frosty" and "dismissive" of Israel's concerns. However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, saying he respects Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Despite this, the ad implicitly underscores the GOP's narrative on Obama's relationship with Israel, implying that he has "thrown Israel under a bus." END OF SUMMARY.
