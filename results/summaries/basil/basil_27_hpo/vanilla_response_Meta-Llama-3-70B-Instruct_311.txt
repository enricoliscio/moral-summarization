SUMMARY:

A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has released a new ad featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, which have large Jewish communities, and is part of a $1 million media campaign. The ad is seen as an attempt to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, particularly in regards to the Obama administration's relationship with Israel. Netanyahu has recently pushed back against criticisms that he is being drawn into the American election, stating that he respects President Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad from Secure America Now targeting Obama, with a previous ad accusing the president of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.
