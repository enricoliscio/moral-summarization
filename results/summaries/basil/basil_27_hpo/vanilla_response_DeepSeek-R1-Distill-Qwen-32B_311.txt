Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative group, featuring Bibi Netanyahu. They're running this ad in Florida, targeting Jewish communities. The ad's about Israel's security concerns with Iran's nuclear program, which Republicans are using to criticize Obama's stance on Iran. Romney has been saying Obama isn't firm enough against Iran and that he's neglecting Israel. Netanyahu, though, says he doesn't want to get involved in the US election and clarifies that the scheduling conflict, not a refusal, caused the meeting cancellation. Secure America Now has run similar ads before, even though they claim to represent all political ideologies. The latest ad doesn't mention Obama by name but supports the GOP narrative about Obama's relationship with Israel.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the ad, the group, where it's airing, the purpose, and the political context. I'll also include Netanyahu's response and the group's past actions. Make sure to keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A new ad by the neoconservative group Secure America Now features Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program. The ad, which has reportedly cost around $400,000 so far, is airing in Florida's Jewish communities. Republicans are using Netanyahu's concerns to criticize President Obama's handling of relations with Israel, with Mitt Romney accusing Obama of neglecting Israel. Netanyahu, however, has distanced himself from the U.S. election, denying claims that Obama refused a meeting and emphasizing his appreciation for Obama's commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Secure America Now, which claims to represent all political ideologies, has previously run ads attacking Obama, including one accusing him of an "apology tour." The latest ad implicitly supports the GOP narrative of Obama's weak stance on Israel and Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
