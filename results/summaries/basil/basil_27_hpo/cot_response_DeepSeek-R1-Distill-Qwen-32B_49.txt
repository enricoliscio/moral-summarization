Alright, I need to tackle this query. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. First, I should break down their requirements.

The user has two main steps. Step 1 is to identify all single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "condemns," "criticizes," "attack," "undermining," etc., come to mind. I'll list each of these with a star before them.

Next, I have to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should focus on the key points: the ad by Secure America Now, the political context, Netanyahu's stance, Romney's criticism, and Obama's response. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

I also need to ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll keep the language clear and direct, sticking to the facts but highlighting the moral aspects as per the instructions.

Let me review the article again to make sure I don't miss any morally framed words. Words like "condemns," "criticizes," "attack," "undermining," "dismissive," "apology tour," "bus," "support," "appreciate," "respect," "opportunity," "schedule," "conflict," "narrative," "ally,"
