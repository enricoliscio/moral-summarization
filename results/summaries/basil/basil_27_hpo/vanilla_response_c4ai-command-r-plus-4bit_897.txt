SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is featured in a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization. The ad, airing in markets with large Jewish communities in Florida, features Netanyahu expressing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It implicitly criticizes President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, echoing Republican attacks on Obama's handling of the Iran issue and his alleged dismissal of Netanyahu. Netanyahu, however, has pushed back against being drawn into US election politics, denying reports of a refused meeting request and affirming his respect for Obama's determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama, despite the group claiming to represent all political ideologies.

END OF SUMMARY.
