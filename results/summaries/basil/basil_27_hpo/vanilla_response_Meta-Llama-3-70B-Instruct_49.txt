SUMMARY:

A new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization, features Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussing Israel's security concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The ad is airing in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Ft. Myers, which have large Jewish communities. The ad is seen as a way to influence the debate around American security and foreign policy, and is likely to be used by Republicans to criticize President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel. However, Netanyahu recently pushed back against these criticisms, saying he will not be drawn into the American election and that Obama has expressed determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. This is not the first ad by Secure America Now targeting Obama, with a previous ad accusing him of embarking on an "apology tour" at the expense of American security.

END OF SUMMARY.
