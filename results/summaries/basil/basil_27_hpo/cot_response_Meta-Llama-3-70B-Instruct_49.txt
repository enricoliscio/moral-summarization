SUMMARY:
A neoconservative nonprofit organization, Secure America Now, has launched a $1 million ad campaign featuring Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, despite his recent denial of involvement in election-year politicking. The ad targets President Barack Obama's relationship with Israel, implying that his administration is "frosty" towards the country and its concerns. Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have repeatedly criticized Obama for not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming he has "thrown Israel under a bus." However, Netanyahu has pushed back against these criticisms, expressing "respect" for Obama's determination to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad is airing in markets with large Jewish communities, and is seen as part of the GOP's narrative on Obama's relationship with Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
