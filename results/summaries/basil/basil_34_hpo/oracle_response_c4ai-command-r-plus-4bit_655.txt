SUMMARY: In response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, the National Rifle Association (NRA) funded a report on school safety that recommends arming teachers and staff. The report, authored by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that properly trained armed employees could provide an additional layer of security in schools. Hutchinson recommends that schools designate willing staff to undergo firearms training, with a proposed model program costing about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. The report also calls for states to loosen restrictions on who can carry firearms on school property.

The recommendations have sparked criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and advocates for broader gun control measures. Randi Weingarten, the union president, called the report "a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe." She accused the NRA of attempting to flood schools with guns.

The NRA, while stating that it needs time to digest the findings, commended Hutchinson for his contributions to school safety. Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, also praised the NRA for their efforts. Hutchinson's report encourages the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons, claiming that enhancing school safety is crucial to protecting children from violence.
