SUMMARY: A 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) recommends arming properly trained school employees as "an important layer of security in schools." The report suggests that schools designate willing staff to undergo firearms training, with a proposed model training program of 40-60 hours per person at a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. Armed school personnel would also be required to pass a background check and have relevant experience. The report was met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and supports broader gun control measures. The union's president, Randi Weingarten, called the report "a cruel hoax." The NRA, however, commended the report, stating that it will contribute to making schools safer. The report also recommends loosening legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property and creating threat assessment teams at schools. Hutchinson encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons. The report was released in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and follows NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre's controversial proposal to arm volunteers in schools.
