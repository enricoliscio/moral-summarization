SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that teachers and other school personnel be armed and trained to provide an additional layer of security in schools. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities should determine their own security measures, including whether to have armed security guards. The report also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, creating threat assessment teams, and better coordinating state and federal funding for school security. The American Federation of Teachers has criticized the report, calling it a "cruel hoax" designed to benefit gun manufacturers. In contrast, the NRA has commended the report, saying it will help make America's schools safer. The report's recommendations have sparked controversy, with some arguing that arming teachers will lead to more violence, while others see it as a necessary measure to protect children.
