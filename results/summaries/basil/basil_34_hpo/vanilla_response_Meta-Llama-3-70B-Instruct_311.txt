SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees be allowed in schools to provide an additional layer of security. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including arming willing staff members who undergo 40-60 hours of firearms training. The report also proposes loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The NRA-funded report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who argue that arming educators will not keep children safe. The report's recommendations include creating threat assessment teams, better coordinating state and federal funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool to evaluate schools' potential security gaps.
