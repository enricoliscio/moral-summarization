Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the NRA's school safety report. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a report released by the NRA, led by Asa Hutchinson. The main recommendations are arming teachers and relaxing gun laws. 

First, the report suggests that trained staff should carry firearms in schools, with training costing around $800-$1,000 each. They also mention that states should loosen restrictions on who can carry guns on school property, which would effectively end gun-free zones. Other recommendations include threat assessment teams, better funding coordination, and an online security tool.

Critics, like the American Federation of Teachers, are against arming educators, calling it a hoax. The NRA claims they didn't influence the report but are supportive. The report's origins are from after the Sandy Hook shooting, where NRA's initial proposal was poorly received, so they adjusted by suggesting trained staff instead of volunteers.

Hutchinson also criticized state gun control measures as inadequate and promoted the NRA's role in funding training programs. A parent of a Sandy Hook victim praised the NRA for their efforts.

So, the summary should include the key points: the report's recommendations, the cost, the opposition, the NRA's stance, and the context from Sandy Hook. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main ideas without getting too detailed.
