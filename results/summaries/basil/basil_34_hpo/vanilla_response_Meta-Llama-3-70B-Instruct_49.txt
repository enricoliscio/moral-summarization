SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that schools consider arming trained employees to provide an additional layer of security. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including whether to arm personnel. The task force proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed staff, at a cost of $800-$1,000 per person. The report also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. Other suggestions include creating threat assessment teams, better coordinating funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool. The report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators. The NRA has distanced itself from the report's findings, but commended the task force for its contributions to school safety.
