SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that teachers be armed to provide an "important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that willing staff members undergo 40-60 hours of firearms training to become armed school personnel. This move is seen as a way to "protect" children and "enhance" school safety. However, the report has been met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who call it a "cruel hoax" designed to "flood" schools with more guns. The report's findings are seen as a way to "assist" gun manufacturers and "fail" to keep children safe. The NRA has commended the report, saying it will "make America's schools safer." The report also recommends loosening gun laws, creating threat assessment teams, and better coordinating funding for school security. The proposal has sparked controversy, with some calling it a way to "eliminate" gun-free school zones and "stop" violence in schools.
