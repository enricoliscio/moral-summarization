Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the NRA's school safety report. Let me read through the article first. 

The article talks about a 225-page report by the NRA, led by Asa Hutchinson, suggesting arming teachers and loosening gun laws. They recommend training teachers to carry firearms, which would cost around $800 to $1,000 each. The report also suggests that states should allow non-law enforcement personnel to carry guns in schools, effectively ending gun-free zones. 

I should note the main points: the report's recommendations, the cost, the types of firearms mentioned, and the opposition from the American Federation of Teachers. Also, the NRA's stance and the criticism they received. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the report's release, its main recommendations, the cost, and the opposition. Then, I'll touch on the NRA's funding and the criticism from the union. Finally, I'll include Hutchinson's comments on gun control measures and the emotional aspect with the Sandy Hook parent. 

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds a new piece of information without overlapping.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page school safety report recommending arming trained teachers and loosening gun laws. Authored by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, the report suggests designating staff members as armed school resource officers after 40-60 hours of training, costing $800-$1,000 per person. It also proposes allowing non-law enforcement personnel, like teachers, to carry firearms in schools, effectively ending gun-free zones. The report recommends threat assessment teams, improved funding coordination, and an online security assessment tool. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, oppose arming educators, calling the report a "cruel hoax." The NRA funded the report but claims it had no influence. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures, such as banning high-capacity magazines, as "totally inadequate," emphasizing the need for enhanced school safety measures. The report, which Hutchinson presented at a press conference, was praised by a Sandy Hook parent whose child was killed in the 2012 shooting. END OF SUMMARY.
