Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's school safety report. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about the NRA funding a report by Asa Hutchinson, which recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws. It mentions the Sandy Hook shooting as the catalyst. The report suggests training teachers to carry firearms, which the NRA supports, but it's met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who oppose arming educators.

I should highlight the recommendations: arming teachers with proper training, loosening gun laws on school property, and other measures like threat assessment teams. Also, note the criticism from the AFT and the NRA's stance. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the moral perspectives, showing both support and opposition.

I'll structure the summary to first present the report's recommendations, then the criticism, and end with the ongoing debate. Make sure to mention the key players and their positions to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page school safety report recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws, following the Sandy Hook shooting. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests schools should train willing staff to carry firearms, at a cost of $800-$1,000 per person, and emphasizes local control over school security decisions. It also proposes allowing non-law enforcement personnel to carry guns in schools, effectively ending gun-free zones. The report received criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which called it a "cruel hoax" and accused the NRA of promoting more guns in schools. The NRA, however, distanced itself from the report, claiming no influence over its findings. Hutchinson defended the recommendations, arguing they enhance school safety, while criticizing state gun control measures as inadequate. The report reflects a broader debate over gun control and school security, with some advocating for armed personnel and others opposing the militarization of schools. END OF SUMMARY.
