SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees provide an "important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including arming willing staff members after 40-60 hours of training. The task force also proposed loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, which many states currently prohibit. The American Federation of Teachers strongly opposes arming educators, calling the report a "cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe." The NRA commended the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." The report's findings were met with "scathing criticism" from the teachers' union, which supports broader gun control measures. Hutchinson called state gun control efforts "totally inadequate" and encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons.
