SUMMARY: In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a National Rifle Association-funded report recommends arming teachers and other school personnel as "an important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that schools designate willing staff to undergo firearms training, with a proposed model training program of 40-60 hours per person. Hutchinson recommends that states loosen legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, arguing that local school authorities are best positioned to determine their own security measures. The report also includes other recommendations such as creating threat assessment teams and better coordinating funding for school security.

The report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and supports broader gun control measures. Randi Weingarten, the union President, called the report "a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe." The NRA, however, has commended the contributions of Hutchinson and his team, stating that they will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, also praised the NRA for their efforts. Hutchinson encourages the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons, arguing that enhancing school safety is crucial to protecting children from violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
