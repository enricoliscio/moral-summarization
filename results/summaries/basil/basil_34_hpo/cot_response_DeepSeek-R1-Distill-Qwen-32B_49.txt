Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. They've outlined two steps: first, identifying morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. For example, "cruel hoax" is a negative moral frame, while "safeguarding" is positive.

Looking at the article, I should go through each sentence and pick out words that have such connotations. Words like "cruel hoax," "fail," "opposes," "loosen," "flood," "disaster," "inadequate," "safeguarding," "supports," "valuable," "commend," "dedication," "resources," and "respect." Each of these carries a moral judgment, either positive or negative.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words while keeping it under 200 words. The summary should capture the main points: the NRA's report recommending arming teachers, the criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, the support from the NRA, and the context of the Sandy Hook shooting.

I should ensure that the summary flows naturally and includes the morally framed words in appropriate contexts. For example, mentioning the report as a "cruel hoax" when discussing the union's criticism, and highlighting the NRA's support as "commendable."

I also need to make sure that the summary doesn't add any new information beyond what's in the article and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it by first introducing the report, then the recommendations, followed by the criticism, and finally the support and context.

I should also check that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

Overall, the key is to balance conciseness with the inclusion of the identified morally framed words, ensuring the summary accurately reflects the article's content and the author's moral perspective.

**SUMMARY:**  
The NRA-funded School Safety Report, led by Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to enhance school security. The report suggests training staff to carry firearms, with costs ranging from $800 to $1,000 per person. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, condemn the proposal as a "cruel hoax" that fails to protect children and allows gun manufacturers to flood schools with weapons. The NRA, however, commends the report, claiming it will safeguard schools. Hutchinson emphasizes that local authorities should decide on security measures, including whether to arm teachers. The report also recommends threat assessment teams and better funding coordination. Despite criticism, Hutchinson supports pilot programs for arming teachers, arguing that broader gun control measures are inadequate. The report reflects the NRA's ongoing efforts to influence school safety, drawing mixed reactions from stakeholders. END OF SUMMARY.
