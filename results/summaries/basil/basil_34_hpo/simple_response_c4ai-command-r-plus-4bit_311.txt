SUMMARY: In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a task force funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA) released a report recommending that schools arm properly trained employees as an "important layer of security." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggested that local school authorities decide their own security measures and designate willing staff to undergo firearms training. The task force also proposed loosening legal restrictions on who can carry firearms on school property. The recommendations have been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and believes the report will fail to keep children safe. The NRA has distanced itself from the report, stating that it needs time to digest the findings. Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, praised the NRA's efforts. Hutchinson encouraged the NRA to continue funding training programs for school employees to carry weapons, emphasizing the need to enhance school safety to protect children. However, he faced criticism for not addressing the separate debate on gun control legislation.
