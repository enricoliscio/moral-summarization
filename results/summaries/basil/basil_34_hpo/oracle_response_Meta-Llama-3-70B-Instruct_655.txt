SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees be allowed to provide an "important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that teachers and principals be armed and trained to prevent future massacres. The NRA claims the report's findings are independent of their influence. However, critics argue that the report is a "cruel hoax" designed to "flood the nation and our schools with more guns." The report's recommendations include loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, creating threat assessment teams, and offering an online assessment tool to evaluate schools' potential security gaps. The NRA commended the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." However, opponents argue that the report will "fail to keep our children and schools safe" and instead "assist gun manufacturers" in profiting from the sale of more guns.
