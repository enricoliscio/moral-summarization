SUMMARY: In a tone-deaf response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the National Rifle Association (NRA) released a report recommending arming teachers and school staff as a solution to school safety. The report, authored by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, calls for trained and armed employees to act as an "important layer of security in schools." The report has been met with strong criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who rightfully argue that more guns in schools is not the answer to preventing gun violence. Randi Weingarten, the union president, called the report "a cruel hoax." Hutchinson's recommendation to arm school personnel and loosen gun laws in schools is a dangerous and misguided approach to addressing school safety. The NRA's insistence on putting more guns in the hands of teachers and school staff instead of supporting broader gun control measures demonstrates a blatant disregard for the lives of our children. The report's release, following NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre's disastrous proposal to arm volunteers in schools, shows that the organization is more interested in promoting gun manufacturing interests than finding effective solutions to prevent gun violence in schools. This report is a moral failure and a disservice to the families who have lost loved ones in school shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
