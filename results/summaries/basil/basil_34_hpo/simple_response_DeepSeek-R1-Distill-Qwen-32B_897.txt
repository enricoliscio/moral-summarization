Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's school safety report. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should first read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the underlying tone.

The article talks about the NRA's report recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. It mentions the Sandy Hook shooting as the catalyst. The report suggests trained employees, including teachers, to carry firearms in schools. It also proposes a training program and cost estimates. The report's recommendations include threat assessment teams, funding coordination, and an online tool for evaluating security gaps.

The moral framing here is important. The author presents both sides: the NRA's support for arming teachers as a proactive measure, and the criticism from groups like the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators. The report is seen as a way to increase gun presence in schools, which some view as dangerous.

I need to capture the pro and anti perspectives. The summary should mention the NRA's stance, the recommendations, and the criticism. It should also highlight the controversy, such as the opposition's view that this approach is a hoax and increases gun availability.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral debate without taking sides. I'll structure it by first introducing the report and its recommendations, then the criticisms, and finally the context of the Sandy Hook shooting and the NRA's involvement.

Let me make sure to include key points: the 225-page report, arming teachers, training programs, criticism from AFT, and the broader context of gun control debates. I should also note the NRA's claim of independence from the report and the mixed reactions, including the victim's father's praise.

I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. The summary should flow logically, starting with the report's release, its recommendations, the criticism, and the implications of the debate.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to cover all these elements succinctly while preserving the moral framing. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: The National Rifle Association (NRA) released a 225-page school safety report, recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that trained school employees, including teachers, should carry firearms to enhance security. It proposes a 40-60 hour training program costing $800-$1,000 per person and recommends allowing non-law enforcement personnel to carry firearms in schools, effectively ending gun-free zones. The report also calls for threat assessment teams, better funding coordination, and an online security evaluation tool. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, argue the report promotes more guns in schools and is a "cruel hoax." The NRA claims the report was independent of their influence but supports its findings. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures, stating they do not address school safety. The report, commissioned after the Sandy Hook shooting, has sparked controversy, with some praising it as a proactive measure and others opposing it as dangerous. END OF SUMMARY.
