SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the National Rifle Association (NRA) commissioned a report on school safety, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson. The 225-page report, titled "School Shield Program," recommended arming properly trained employees as an "important layer of security in schools." Hutchinson suggested that local school authorities are best suited to determine their own security measures, including the arming of non-law enforcement staff like teachers and principals. The report proposed a model training program for armed school personnel, with a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. Other recommendations included creating threat assessment teams and improving funding coordination for school security. Hutchinson encouraged the NRA to continue funding training programs for school employees to carry weapons, stating that enhancing school safety is crucial to protecting children. The report was met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who oppose arming educators and view the findings as a means to flood schools with more guns. The NRA, while claiming no influence over the report's findings, commended the contributions toward safer schools. This report reflects the NRA's stance on school safety, focusing on arming staff and enhancing security measures rather than implementing gun control legislation.
