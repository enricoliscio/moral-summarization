SUMMARY: Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA). The report recommends arming properly trained school employees and loosening gun laws to improve school security. Hutchinson stated that the findings were independent of the NRA and that local school authorities should decide their own security measures. The report suggests arming willing staff, with recommended training of 40-60 hours per person, and requiring armed personnel to undergo background checks and have relevant experience. It also proposes loosening restrictions on who can carry firearms on school property. The American Federation of Teachers criticized the report, calling it a "cruel hoax." The NRA, however, commended Hutchinson for his contributions to school safety. The report also encourages the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons. The release of the report follows NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre's controversial proposal to arm volunteers in schools, which was met with resistance. Hutchinson's report instead recommends arming non-law enforcement school staff, effectively eliminating gun-free school zones. Hutchinson also criticized current gun control efforts, stating that addressing assault weapons will not stop school violence. END OF SUMMARY.
