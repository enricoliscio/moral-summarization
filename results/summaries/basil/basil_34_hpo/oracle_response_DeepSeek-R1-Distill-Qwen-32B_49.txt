Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's school safety report. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used. They provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making it sound forced.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The report, led by Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers after proper training. It suggests that schools decide their own security measures, including whether to have armed guards. The training would be 40-60 hours, costing around $800-$1000 per person. They also want states to loosen gun laws so more people can carry guns in schools. Other recommendations include threat assessment teams and better funding coordination.

The report was criticized by the American Federation of Teachers, calling it a hoax and saying it would flood schools with guns. The NRA supports the report but claims they had no influence. There's mention of the Sandy Hook shooting and how the idea of armed volunteers was dropped because employees weren't keen on it.

Hutchinson also commented on gun control measures in Connecticut, calling them inadequate and suggesting that focusing on school safety is better. He mentioned the NRA funding pilot programs and acknowledged a parent whose child was killed in Sandy Hook.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words like "shooting," "arm," "investigation," "testing," "hoax," etc. I should structure it to include the recommendations, the criticism, the context of Sandy Hook, and the response from the NRA and others.

I'll start by introducing the report, mention the recommendations, the training, and the loosening of gun laws. Then, I'll note the criticism from AFT and the NRA's stance. I'll include Hutchinson's comments on gun control and the mention of the Sandy Hook parent. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without going into too much detail.

I should make sure to use the moral words naturally within the summary. For example, "arming teachers," "hoax," "flood," "protect," "violence," etc. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts while maintaining the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence includes the necessary elements and flows well. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. After writing, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral words are appropriately included without disrupting the flow.

SUMMARY: The NRA-funded report, led by Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers after 40-60 hours of training to enhance school safety, following the Sandy Hook shooting. It suggests local schools decide on armed guards and proposes loosening gun laws to allow non-law enforcement personnel to carry firearms. The report also recommends threat assessment teams, better funding coordination, and an online security tool. Critics, like the American Federation of Teachers, call the report a "hoax" and warn it could flood schools with guns. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures as "inadequate," emphasizing school safety over violence prevention. The NRA supports the report, though it claims no influence. Hutchinson acknowledged Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed at Sandy Hook, praising the NRA's efforts. The report's recommendations aim to "protect" children but face criticism for potentially increasing violence and failing to address root causes. END OF SUMMARY.
