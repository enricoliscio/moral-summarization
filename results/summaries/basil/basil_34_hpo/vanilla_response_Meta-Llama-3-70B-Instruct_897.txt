SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees be allowed in schools to provide an additional layer of security. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including whether to arm willing staff members. The task force proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed school personnel, who would also undergo background investigations and testing. The report also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The American Federation of Teachers has criticized the report, calling it a "cruel hoax" that will fail to keep children and schools safe. The NRA has commended the report, saying it will help make America's schools safer.
