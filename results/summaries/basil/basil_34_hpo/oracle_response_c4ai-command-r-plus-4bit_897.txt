SUMMARY: Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) released a controversial 225-page report on school safety, funded by the National Rifle Association and prepared by a task force he led, in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The report recommends arming properly trained school employees and loosening gun laws as essential layers of security in schools. Hutchinson suggests that local school authorities decide their security measures, including arming willing staff after comprehensive firearms training. The proposal has been met with criticism, with the American Federation of Teachers calling it a cruel hoax that will fail to protect students and instead flood schools with guns. The task force also recommends threat assessment teams and better coordination of funding for school security. Hutchinson encourages the elimination of gun-free school zones and the enhancement of school safety measures, claiming that addressing assault weapons alone won't stop school violence. The report's release included testimony from Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, praising the NRA's efforts.
