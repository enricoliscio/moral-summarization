SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees provide an "important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own school security measures, including designating willing staff to be armed and trained. The task force proposed a model training program, requiring 40-60 hours of training at a cost of $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. The report was met with "scathing criticism" from the American Federation of Teachers, which called the report a "cruel hoax" designed to "flood the nation and our schools with more guns." In contrast, the NRA commended the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." The report's recommendations have sparked controversy, with some calling them "totally inadequate" and others praising the NRA's efforts to enhance school safety. END OF SUMMARY.
