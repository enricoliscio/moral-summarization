Alright, so the user has provided a news article about the NRA's school safety report and wants a summary. First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about a report by the NRA recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. 

I should identify the key elements: who, what, when, where, why. The report was released by Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman, and it's part of the NRA's initiative after Sandy Hook. The main recommendations are arming teachers after training, loosening gun laws in schools, and other measures like threat assessment teams.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I should mention the opposition from the American Federation of Teachers and the NRA's stance that they didn't influence the report. Also, the background on the NRA's previous proposal and Hutchinson's response to criticism.

I should structure the summary to include the report's recommendations, the opposition, and the context of the Sandy Hook shooting. Make sure to highlight the controversial aspects and the differing opinions on gun control versus school safety measures.

I need to ensure clarity and avoid jargon, keeping it straightforward. Also, the summary should end with the specified tokens. Let me make sure to cover all the main points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The NRA-backed School Shield Program, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws in schools to enhance safety. The 225-page report, released after the Sandy Hook shooting, suggests training staff to carry firearms, with costs ranging from $800 to $1,000 per person. It also proposes allowing non-law enforcement personnel to carry guns in schools, effectively ending gun-free zones. The task force recommends threat assessment teams, better funding coordination, and online security assessments. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, argue the report promotes more guns in schools and fails to address violence effectively. The NRA claims it had no influence over the report but supports its findings. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures, calling them "totally inadequate." The report, which scrapped the idea of armed volunteers due to resistance, has been controversial since its inception. END OF SUMMARY.
