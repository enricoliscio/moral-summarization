SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that teachers and school staff be armed and trained to provide an additional layer of security in schools. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities should determine their own security measures, including designating willing staff to be armed and trained. The report also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The NRA claims it had no influence on the report's findings, but critics argue that the recommendations are designed to benefit gun manufacturers. The report has been met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who argue that arming educators will not keep children safe. The NRA, on the other hand, has commended the report, saying it will make America's schools safer.
