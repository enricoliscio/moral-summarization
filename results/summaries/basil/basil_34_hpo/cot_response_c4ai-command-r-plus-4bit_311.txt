SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a task force funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA) released a report recommending that properly trained armed employees be introduced in schools to improve safety. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities are best positioned to determine their own security measures and that willing staff should be designated to undergo firearms training. Hutchinson proposes a model training program of 40-60 hours per person, costing about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. The task force also recommends loosening legal restrictions on who can carry firearms on school property and creating threat assessment teams. Hutchinson's report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and believes the findings prioritize gun manufacturers' interests over student safety. The NRA, however, commends the report's contributions to enhancing school safety. The report also encourages the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons. Despite criticism of arming volunteers, the recommendation to allow non-law enforcement officers to carry guns in schools would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones. Hutchinson also deems state gun control efforts inadequate, emphasizing the need to enhance school safety measures to protect children. END OF SUMMARY.
