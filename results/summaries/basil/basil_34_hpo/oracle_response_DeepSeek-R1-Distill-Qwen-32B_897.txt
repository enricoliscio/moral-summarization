Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the NRA's school safety report, which recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws. 

I notice the author uses specific morally charged words like "shooting," "arm," "investigation," "testing," "hoax," "fail," "designed," "assist," "flood," "making," "massacre," "eliminate," "stop," "violence," "protect," "enhancing," and "killed." My goal is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without losing the essence of the report.

The report, led by Asa Hutchinson, suggests training teachers to carry firearms, which some criticize as a "hoax" that won't protect students. The American Federation of Teachers is against it, calling it a way to flood schools with guns. The NRA claims it had no influence, but the report still suggests loosening gun laws, which could eliminate gun-free zones. The author also mentions the emotional aspect with the father of a Sandy Hook victim praising the NRA's efforts.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by introducing the report and its recommendations, then touch on the criticism, the NRA's stance, and the emotional response. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

Let me structure it: introduce the report, mention the recommendations, include the criticism, the NRA's response, and the emotional element. I'll keep each sentence concise and ensure the moral words are integrated naturally.

Now, I'll draft the summary, checking word count and ensuring all important points are covered. I'll make sure it's clear and flows well, preserving the original moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The NRA-funded School Safety Report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to enhance school security. The report, released after the Sandy Hook shooting, suggests training staff to carry firearms, with costs ranging from $800 to $1,000 per person. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, condemn the plan as a "cruel hoax" designed to flood schools with guns. Hutchinson argues that local authorities should decide on armed security, emphasizing that teachers with proper training could provide an "important layer of security." The report also proposes threat assessment teams, better funding coordination, and an online tool to identify security gaps. However, the American Federation of Teachers accuses the NRA of using the report to assist gun manufacturers. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures, calling them "totally inadequate" and emphasizing the need to enhance school safety directly. The report, which also received praise from the NRA, aims to "make America's schools safer," though its recommendations remain controversial. END OF SUMMARY.
