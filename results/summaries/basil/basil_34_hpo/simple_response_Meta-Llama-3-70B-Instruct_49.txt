SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that teachers and school staff be armed and trained to provide an additional layer of security in schools. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities should determine their own security measures, including whether to have armed security guards. The NRA-funded report also proposes loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who argue that arming educators will not keep children safe and is instead a ploy to increase gun sales. The NRA, on the other hand, has commended the report, saying it will make America's schools safer. The report's recommendations are morally questionable, prioritizing the interests of gun manufacturers over the safety and well-being of children.
