Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them closely.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a positive or negative connotation. For example, "cruel hoax" has a negative moral frame, so "cruel" and "hoax" are key. Words like "safeguard," "protect," "oppose," "flood," "disaster," "inadequate," "protect," and "valuable" all carry moral weight. I'll list each of these with a star.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: the NRA report's recommendations, the criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, the NRA's stance, and the context of the Sandy Hook shooting. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing, showing both support and opposition.

I should also keep the summary clear and factual while embedding the moral terms. I'll structure it to mention the report's recommendations, the criticism it received, and the ongoing debate on gun control. Ending with the call for pilot programs ties it back to the NRA's involvement and the need for school safety.

Let me make sure I don't exceed the word limit and that each step is clearly marked. I'll double-check the morally framed words to ensure they're all included and that the summary flows naturally while preserving the original moral perspective.

**STEP 1:**  
* Cruel  
* Hoax  
* Flood  
* Disaster  
* Inadequate  
* Protect  
* Safeguard  
* Oppose  
* Valuable  

**SUMMARY:**  
The NRA-funded School Shield Program, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to enhance school safety. The report suggests training staff to carry firearms, with costs ranging from $800 to $1,000 per person, and proposes allowing non-law enforcement personnel to carry guns in schools. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, condemn the plan as a "cruel hoax" that prioritizes gun proliferation over student safety. The NRA claims the report is independent but praised its findings. Hutchinson emphasized local control over school security and dismissed broader gun control measures as "inadequate," urging focus on school safety measures instead. The report also calls for pilot programs to train educators to carry weapons, a move criticized as potentially flooding schools with guns. The recommendations stem from the NRA's response to the Sandy Hook shooting, with the gun lobby advocating for armed volunteers and eliminating gun-free zones. END OF SUMMARY.
