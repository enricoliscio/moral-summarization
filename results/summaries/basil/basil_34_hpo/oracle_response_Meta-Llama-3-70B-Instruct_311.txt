SUMMARY:

A 225-page report on school safety, funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA), recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to prevent future massacres. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that properly trained armed employees can provide "an important layer of security in schools." The task force proposes a 40-60 hour training program for willing staff members, at a cost of $800 to $1,000 per person. The report also recommends creating threat assessment teams, better coordinating state and federal funding, and offering an online assessment tool to evaluate schools' potential security gaps. Critics, such as the American Federation of Teachers, have labeled the report a "cruel hoax" designed to "flood the nation and our schools with more guns." The NRA, on the other hand, commended the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." The report's findings have sparked controversy, with some arguing that arming teachers will fail to protect children and instead lead to more violence.
