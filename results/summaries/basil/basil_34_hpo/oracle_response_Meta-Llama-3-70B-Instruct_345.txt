SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees be allowed in schools to provide an "important layer of security." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including arming willing staff members after 40-60 hours of training. The task force also proposes loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, which many states currently prohibit. The report's findings have been met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who call it a "cruel hoax" designed to "flood the nation and our schools with more guns." The NRA, however, commends the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." The report's recommendations aim to "protect children" and "enhance school safety," but critics argue it will "fail" to do so and instead perpetuate "violence" in schools.
