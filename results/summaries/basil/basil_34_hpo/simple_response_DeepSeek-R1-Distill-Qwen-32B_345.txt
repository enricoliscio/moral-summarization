Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's school safety report. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the NRA funding a report by Asa Hutchinson, suggesting arming teachers. The report recommends training teachers to carry guns, which some see as a way to enhance security, while others, like the AFT, oppose it. The author presents both sides but seems critical, especially highlighting the opposition's points.

I should focus on the key recommendations: arming teachers after training, loosening gun laws, and the criticism from unions and others. Also, mention the NRA's stance and the context of Sandy Hook. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear, showing the debate and criticisms.

Let me structure it: start with the report's recommendations, then the criticism, and the context. Make sure to include both supporters and opponents' viewpoints as presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
The NRA-funded school safety report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to enhance school security. The report, commissioned after the Sandy Hook shooting, suggests training staff to carry firearms and allowing non-law enforcement personnel to carry guns in schools. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, argue the proposal is a "cruel hoax" that prioritizes gun proliferation over student safety. The report also advocates for threat assessment teams, improved funding coordination, and an online security assessment tool. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures, calling them "totally inadequate," and emphasized the need for school-specific safety measures. The NRA, while distancing itself from direct influence over the report, praised its potential to make schools safer. The proposal has sparked controversy, with opponents warning against arming educators and advocates touting it as a proactive security measure. END OF SUMMARY.
