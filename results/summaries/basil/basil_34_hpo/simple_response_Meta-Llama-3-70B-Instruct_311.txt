SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that teachers and school staff be armed and trained to provide an additional layer of security in schools. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities should determine their own school security measures, including whether to have armed security guards. The report also proposes loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The American Federation of Teachers has strongly criticized the report, calling it a "cruel hoax" that will fail to keep children and schools safe. In contrast, the NRA has commended the report, saying it will go a long way to making America's schools safer. The report's recommendations have sparked controversy, with opponents arguing that it will lead to more guns in schools and proponents arguing that it will enhance school safety.
