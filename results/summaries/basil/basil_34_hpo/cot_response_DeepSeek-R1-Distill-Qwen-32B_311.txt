Alright, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break down what they need.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They've given a two-step process: identify morally framed single words and then write a summary using those words.

Looking at the article, it's about the NRA's school safety report recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. The author uses words that carry moral connotations, like "cruel hoax," "flood," "disaster," "inadequate," and "sacrifice." These words are crucial because they reflect the moral stance of the article.

For the first step, I need to extract each single word that's morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have strong positive or negative connotations. Words like "cruel," "hoax," "flood," "disaster," "inadequate," "sacrifice," and "safer" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping these moral words intact. The summary should be under 200 words and include the key points: the report's recommendations, criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, the NRA's stance, and the context of the Sandy Hook shooting. I need to ensure that the moral framing isn't lost, so I'll include those words where appropriate.

I also need to structure the response with "STEP 1:" followed by each moral word on a new line, then the summary after "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I must make sure the summary is clear and captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral perspective.

I should double-check that I haven't missed any morally framed words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone. It's important to balance conciseness with completeness, ensuring all critical points are included without exceeding the word limit.

**STEP 1:**  
* Cruel  
* Hoax  
* Flood  
* Disaster  
* Inadequate  
* Sacrifice  
* Safer  

**SUMMARY:**  
The NRA-funded School Safety Report, led by Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to enhance school security. The report suggests training staff to carry firearms, with costs ranging from $800 to $1,000 per person, and proposes allowing non-law enforcement personnel, such as teachers, to carry guns in schools. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, condemn the report as a "cruel hoax," arguing it promotes more guns in schools rather than addressing gun control. The NRA claims the report is independent and aims to "make America's schools safer." Hutchinson dismisses broader gun control measures as "totally inadequate," emphasizing the need for school safety measures like threat assessment teams and armed personnel. The report, however, has faced backlash for potentially flooding schools with firearms and undermining gun-free zones. Hutchinson acknowledged the emotional impact of the Sandy Hook shooting, calling it a "sacrifice" that inspired the report.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
