SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees provide an "important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including designating willing staff to be armed and trained. The task force proposed a model training program, which would cost around $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. The report also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, a move that has been met with "scathing criticism" from the American Federation of Teachers. The union called the report a "cruel hoax" that will fail to keep children and schools safe, and accused the NRA of trying to "flood the nation and our schools with more guns." In contrast, the NRA commended the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer."
