SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the National Rifle Association (NRA) released a 225-page report on school safety, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson. The report recommends arming properly trained employees as an important layer of security in schools. Hutchinson stressed that the findings are independent of the NRA and that local school authorities are best positioned to determine their own security measures, specifically whether armed security is necessary and supported by the community. The report recommends designating willing staff members to be armed and trained, with a proposed 40-60 hours of training per person. Armed personnel would also be required to have a background investigation, testing, and relevant experience. The task force did not recommend specific firearms but suggested that states loosen restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. Other recommendations include creating threat assessment teams and enhancing coordination of funding for school safety. Hutchinson encourages the NRA to continue funding training programs for school employees to carry weapons, emphasizing that enhancing school safety is crucial to protecting children. The report has been met with criticism by those who oppose arming educators and support broader gun control measures, while the NRA commends the contributions as a step towards safer schools.
