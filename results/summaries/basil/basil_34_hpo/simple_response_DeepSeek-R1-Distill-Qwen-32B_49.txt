Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the NRA's school safety report. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about a report by the NRA recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. It mentions the Sandy Hook shooting as the catalyst. The report suggests training teachers to carry guns, which is a controversial idea. The task force led by Asa Hutchinson says schools should decide their own security measures, and the cost is around $800-$1000 per trained employee. They also want states to allow non-law enforcement to carry guns in schools, effectively ending gun-free zones.

Critics, like the American Federation of Teachers, are against this, calling it a hoax and promoting more guns. The NRA claims they didn't influence the report, but they support it. Hutchinson also criticized state gun control efforts, saying they don't prevent school violence.

I need to make sure the summary includes both the recommendations and the criticism, highlighting the moral aspects. The author seems critical of arming teachers, so the summary should reflect that tension.

I should start by stating the report's main recommendations, then mention the criticism, and end with the ongoing debate. Keep it under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Let me structure it: introduce the report, its recommendations, the criticism from AFT, the NRA's stance, and the debate over gun control effectiveness. Make sure to include that the report was funded by NRA but claims independence.

I need to ensure the summary is concise but covers all key points, preserving the moral framing by showing both sides but highlighting the criticism against arming teachers.

SUMMARY: A 225-page report funded by the NRA, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to enhance school safety. The report suggests training willing staff to carry firearms, with costs around $800-$1,000 per person, and proposes eliminating gun-free school zones. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, condemn the plan as a "cruel hoax" that promotes more guns in schools. The NRA claims no influence over the report but supports its findings. Hutchinson argues that gun control measures are inadequate and advocates for improved school security. The report, which emerged after the Sandy Hook shooting, has sparked controversy over the balance between gun access and student safety. END OF SUMMARY.
