SUMMARY: A 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) recommends arming properly trained school employees and loosening gun laws to improve school security. The report, released on Tuesday, suggests that schools designate willing staff to undergo firearms training and proposes a model training program of 40-60 hours per person at a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per employee. Hutchinson stated that local school authorities are best positioned to determine their own security measures and that armed school personnel would be required to meet certain criteria, including a background check and relevant experience. The task force also recommended that states relax legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The report was met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and supports broader gun control measures. The NRA, while stating that it needs time to digest the findings, commended Hutchinson's contributions to school safety. The report is the culmination of a controversial process that began in December when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre proposed arming volunteers to protect schools.
