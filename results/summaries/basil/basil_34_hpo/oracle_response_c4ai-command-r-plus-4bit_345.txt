SUMMARY: In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a controversial process began that culminated in the release of a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association and led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.). The report recommends arming teachers and other school personnel who are willing to undergo firearms training as a way to enhance school safety and protect children from violence. Hutchinson suggests that local school authorities are best positioned to determine their own security measures, including the arming of non-law enforcement staff, which would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones. The report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who call it a cruel hoax that will fail to keep children safe and instead flood schools with guns. The union President, Randi Weingarten, strongly opposes arming educators. Hutchinson, however, encourages the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons. The report also recommends threat assessment teams, better coordination of funding, and an online assessment tool for administrators. Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, praised the NRA for their efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
