SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that schools arm trained employees to provide an "important layer of security." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including designating willing staff to be armed and trained. The NRA-funded report was met with "scathing criticism" from the American Federation of Teachers, who called it a "cruel hoax" that will fail to keep children safe. The report's findings were deemed "totally inadequate" by critics, who argue that it prioritizes gun manufacturers' interests over children's safety. In contrast, the NRA commended the report, saying it will "go a long way to making America's schools safer." The report's recommendations include creating threat assessment teams, better coordinating funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool. END OF SUMMARY.
