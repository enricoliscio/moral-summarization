SUMMARY: A 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) recommends arming properly trained school employees as an "important layer of security." The report suggests that schools designate willing staff to undergo firearms training and proposes a model training program of 40-60 hours per person. It also recommends that states loosen legal restrictions on who can carry firearms on school property. The report was met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and supports broader gun control measures. Hutchinson defended the report, stating that local school authorities are in the best position to determine their own security measures. The NRA, while insisting it had no influence over the report, commended Hutchinson's contributions to school safety. The report also encourages the continuation of pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons. Mark Mattioli, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, praised the NRA's efforts.
