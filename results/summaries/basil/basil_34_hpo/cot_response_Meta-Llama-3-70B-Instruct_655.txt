SUMMARY:
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that properly trained armed employees provide an "important layer of security in schools." The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own school security measures, including designating willing staff to be armed and trained. The task force proposed a model training program, which would cost around $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. The report also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property, which has been met with "scathing criticism" from the American Federation of Teachers. The union's president, Randi Weingarten, called the report a "cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe," adding that the findings are "simply designed to assist gun manufacturers flood the nation and our schools with more guns."
