SUMMARY:

A 225-page report on school safety, funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA), recommends arming teachers and loosening gun laws to prevent future massacres like the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that properly trained armed employees can provide an "important layer of security in schools." However, critics argue that this approach is a "cruel hoax" designed to "flood the nation and our schools with more guns" and will ultimately "fail" to keep children safe. The report's recommendations include designating willing staff to be armed and trained, with a proposed 40-60 hour training program at a cost of $800-$1,000 per employee. The NRA has distanced itself from the report, saying it needs "time to digest" the findings, but has commended the team for their contributions to making America's schools safer. The report's approach has been met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who argue that it will not stop violence in schools.
