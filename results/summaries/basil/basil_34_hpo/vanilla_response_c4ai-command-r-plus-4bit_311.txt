SUMMARY: A 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) recommends arming trained school employees and loosening gun laws as key measures to improve school security. The report, released on Tuesday, suggests that schools designate willing staff to undergo firearms training and proposes a model training program of 40-60 hours per person. It also recommends that states relax legal restrictions on who can carry firearms on school property. The report was met with criticism by the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes arming educators and advocates for broader gun control measures. Hutchinson defended the report's findings, stating that local school authorities are best positioned to determine their own security measures. The NRA, while stating that it needs time to digest the findings, commended the contributions of Hutchinson and his team. The report is part of a controversial process that began in December when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre proposed arming volunteers to protect schools. Hutchinson's report refines this idea by recommending the arming of trained school staff, such as teachers and principals, rather than volunteers. Hutchinson also criticized current gun control efforts in Congress and Connecticut as inadequate, emphasizing the need to focus on enhancing school safety.
