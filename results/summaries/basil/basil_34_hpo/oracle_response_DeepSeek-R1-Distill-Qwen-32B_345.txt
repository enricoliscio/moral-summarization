Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without making it too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the NRA's school safety report recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. The report was commissioned after the Sandy Hook shooting. The author used words like "shooting," "arm," "investigation," etc., which I need to include.

I should structure the summary to highlight the recommendations, the criticism, and the context. I'll start by mentioning the report's release, its recommendations, and the funding by the NRA. Then, I'll note the criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, using words like "hoax" and "fail." I'll also include the NRA's stance and the context of the Sandy Hook tragedy.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes all the key moral terms. I'll check each point to make sure I'm not missing any important details or the framing words. Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the emotional context with the father's praise, using "killed" appropriately.

SUMMARY:  
The National Rifle Association (NRA) released a 225-page school safety report, funded by the NRA, recommending arming teachers and loosening gun laws. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests training school staff to carry firearms, with costs ranging from $800 to $1,000 per person. It emphasizes local control over school security measures, including whether to arm teachers. The report also proposes eliminating gun-free school zones and allowing non-law enforcement personnel to carry firearms. Critics, including the American Federation of Teachers, condemn the plan as a "cruel hoax" that fails to protect children, accusing it of being designed to flood schools with guns. The NRA, however, claims the report is independent and commends its potential to make schools safer. Hutchinson dismissed broader gun control measures, calling them "totally inadequate" to stop school violence. The report follows the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, where 20 children and six adults were killed. Hutchinson was praised by Mark Mattioli, whose son was among those killed, for the NRA's efforts to enhance school safety. END OF SUMMARY.
