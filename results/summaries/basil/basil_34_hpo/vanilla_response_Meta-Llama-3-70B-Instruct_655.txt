SUMMARY:

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a 225-page report on school safety, recommending that teachers and school staff be armed and trained to provide an additional layer of security in schools. The report, led by former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, suggests that local school authorities determine their own security measures, including whether to arm personnel. The report proposes a 40-60 hour training program for armed school personnel, at a cost of $800-$1,000 per person. It also recommends loosening current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. The report has been met with criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, who argue that arming educators will not keep children safe. The NRA has commended the report, saying it will help make schools safer.
