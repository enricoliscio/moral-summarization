SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to support Clinton over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and highlighted their contrasting business histories, saying he built his business without his father's financial support. He attacked Trump's economic plan as a "con" and a "disaster," expressing concern about Trump's hardline immigration stance and its potential impact on the economy. Bloomberg considered running for president as a third-party candidate but opted against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump. He acknowledged disagreements with Clinton but emphasized the importance of putting them aside for the good of the country. Bloomberg's endorsement highlighted the bipartisan support for Clinton and underscored the growing concern among moderates and independents about the prospect of a Trump presidency.
