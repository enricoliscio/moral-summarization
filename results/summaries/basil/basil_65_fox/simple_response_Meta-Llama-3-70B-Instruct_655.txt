SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the importance of supporting her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower" who has a history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and exploiting others. He contrasted his own business success with Trump's, highlighting the hypocrisy of Trump's claims to run the nation like his business. Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run, opted against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump win. He praised Clinton, with whom he had a cordial relationship during her senatorial tenure, and condemned Trump's hardline immigration stance and economic plan as "a con" and "a disaster in the making." Bloomberg's endorsement is a call to put aside differences and unite for the good of the country, warning that Trump's presidency would be catastrophic.
