SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the imperative of uniting against Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, highlighted their moral differences, calling Trump a dangerous demagogue and a bomb-thrower. He contrasted their business histories, criticizing Trump for bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheating customers, deeming his economic plan a con and a disaster. Bloomberg, worth $48 billion, considered a third-party run but feared aiding Trump's election. He cited Trump's immigration stance and economic plan as deal-breakers, calling Trump's wealth a display of hypocrisy. Bloomberg urged voters to set aside differences with Clinton for the nation's good, reflecting on their post-9/11 partnership and his personal experience with Trump's damaging policies.
