Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

Bloomberg is a former NYC mayor and a billionaire. He endorsed Clinton at the Democratic convention, saying it's imperative to support her over Trump. He mentioned that he sometimes disagrees with Clinton but thinks it's crucial to set aside differences for the country's good. He criticized Trump, calling him a dangerous demagogue and comparing their business backgrounds. Bloomberg built his business from scratch, while Trump inherited money and has a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. He also worried that a third-party run could help Trump win. Bloomberg had a good relationship with Clinton but was turned off by Trump's immigration policies. He called Trump's economic plan a con and a disaster. Trump didn't respond immediately.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Bloomberg's endorsement, his reasons, his criticism of Trump, their business comparisons, his past consideration of a third-party run, his relationship with Clinton, and his view on Trump's policies. I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all these aspects without going into too much detail.
