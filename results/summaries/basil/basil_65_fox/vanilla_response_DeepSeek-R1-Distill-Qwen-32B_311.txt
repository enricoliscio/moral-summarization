Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. 

Bloomberg endorsed Clinton at the Democratic convention, saying it's crucial to support her over Trump. He's a former Democrat, became a Republican mayor, then an independent. He mentions disagreeing with Clinton but putting that aside for the country. He criticizes Trump as a dangerous demagogue, comparing their business backgrounds. Bloomberg built his business from scratch, while Trump had a million-dollar check from his dad and a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. He warns that Trump's business approach would be bad for the country. Bloomberg also considered running as a third-party candidate but decided against it to avoid helping Trump. He had good relationships with both Clinton and Trump before, but Trump's immigration policies alienated him. Trump didn't respond immediately.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, his background, his criticisms of Trump, and his decision not to run. I'll make sure to include key points like the business comparison, the third-party consideration, and his stance on immigration. I'll keep it concise, focusing on the main ideas without too much detail.

SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat who later became an independent, acknowledged disagreements with Clinton but emphasized the need to set them aside for the country's sake. He criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg, who briefly considered a third-party run, decided against it to avoid siphoning votes from Clinton and inadvertently aiding Trump's election. He also criticized Trump's immigration policies and economic plan, calling them a "con" and a "disaster." Bloomberg's relationship with Trump soured over policy differences, though he had cordial ties with Clinton during her tenure as New York senator. Trump did not immediately respond to the speech. END OF SUMMARY.
