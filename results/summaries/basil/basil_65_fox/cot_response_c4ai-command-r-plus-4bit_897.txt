SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" that voters back Clinton over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, threw several moral jabs at Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." He criticized Trump's business record, accusing him of leaving a trail of "bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheated shareholders and contractors" and "disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." Bloomberg characterized Trump's economic plan as "a con" and "a disaster in the making." He contrasted his own business success, achieved without a "million-dollar check from my father," with Trump's inherited wealth, calling it "the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy." Bloomberg's endorsement comes after he considered a third-party run but ultimately decided against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump win. Bloomberg's relationship with Clinton and Trump in the past has been cordial, but Trump's hardline immigration stance alienated Bloomberg, who champions open immigration for economic growth.
