SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton and prioritize the good of the country. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower" who has a history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheating contractors and customers. He warned that Trump's business approach would be disastrous for the nation. Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run, opted against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump win. He praised Clinton's involvement in New York's post-9/11 rebuilding effort and criticized Trump's hardline approach to immigration, which he believes is essential for economic growth. Bloomberg's endorsement emphasized the moral imperative to reject Trump's divisive and harmful policies and instead choose a leader who will work for the good of all Americans.
