Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. He emphasizes the importance of voting for Clinton over Trump, using strong moral terms. I should note the specific morally framed words the author used, such as "put," "start," "cheated," "hypocrisy," etc. My goal is to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll identify the main points: Bloomberg's endorsement, his criticism of Trump, their business backgrounds contrast, Trump's record of bankruptcies and lawsuits, and the moral implications of supporting Clinton. I need to ensure the summary captures these points concisely.

I should structure the summary to start with Bloomberg's endorsement, then move on to his criticisms of Trump, highlighting the moral framing. I'll mention the contrast between their business histories, Trump's record, and Bloomberg's concern about third-party candidacy. I'll also include his support for Clinton and the moral reasons behind it.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include all the key moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence flows logically and incorporates the necessary vocabulary.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and effectively conveys the moral framing without losing the essence of the original article.

SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheated stakeholders. He warned that Trump's approach to governance would be a "disaster" and accused him of hypocrisy. Bloomberg also expressed concern that a third-party run could help Trump win. While he acknowledged disagreements with Clinton, he urged putting them aside for the country's good. Trump's hardline immigration policies and economic plan, which Bloomberg deemed a "con," further alienated him. The endorsement highlighted Bloomberg's belief that Clinton's leadership was needed to rebuild the nation and avoid a "disaster in the making." END OF SUMMARY.
