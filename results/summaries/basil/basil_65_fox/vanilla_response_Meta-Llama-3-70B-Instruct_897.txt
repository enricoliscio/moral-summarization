SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, stating it's "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat and independent, acknowledged disagreements with Clinton but emphasized the need to put them aside for the country's good. He criticized Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," and contrasted their business histories, highlighting his own success without family financial support. Bloomberg also pointed to Trump's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied customers and shareholders. He warned that Trump's economic plan would be a "disaster in the making." Bloomberg had considered a third-party presidential run but opted against it, fearing it would inadvertently help Trump. His endorsement of Clinton marks a significant moment in the presidential campaign.
