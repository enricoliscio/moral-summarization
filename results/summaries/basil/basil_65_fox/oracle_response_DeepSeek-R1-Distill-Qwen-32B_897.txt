Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included if possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the DNC, emphasizing the importance of voting against Trump. He mentioned disagreements with Clinton but put them aside for the country's good. He criticized Trump as a dangerous demagogue, contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg also worried that a third-party run might help Trump win. He highlighted the need for an open immigration policy and called Trump's economic plan a con and disaster.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary, using as many of the provided moral words as possible. I should focus on the key points: endorsement, reasons for supporting Clinton, criticisms of Trump, and Bloomberg's business contrast. I'll structure the summary to include the moral terms like "put aside," "start," "cheated," "hypocrisy," "rebuilding," "needed," "con," and "disaster."

I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement and the reason. Then, mention his criticisms of Trump, using the moral terms. Include his business comparison and the potential impact of a third-party run. Finally, touch on his stance on immigration and Trump's economic plan.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating the moral framing.

He criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "hypocrite," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheating shareholders and customers. Bloomberg, who briefly considered a third-party run, worried it might siphon votes and inadvertently help Trump win. He emphasized the need for an open immigration policy to rebuild the economy and called Trump's economic plan a "con" and "disaster in the making." END OF SUMMARY.
