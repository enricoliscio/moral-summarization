SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the importance of supporting her over GOP nominee Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump's business history, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." He highlighted Trump's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disappointed customers, saying "God help us" if Trump were to run the nation like his business. Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run, opted against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump win. He praised Clinton, with whom he had a cordial relationship during her time as a senator from New York. Bloomberg condemned Trump's hardline approach to immigration, deeming it a threat to the nation's economy. He urged voters to put aside their disagreements and support Clinton for the good of the country.
