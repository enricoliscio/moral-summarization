SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, stressing that it was "imperative" to back her over GOP nominee Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, threw several jabs at Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has a history of "bankruptcies" and "thousands of lawsuits". Bloomberg criticized Trump's business record, saying he "left behind a well-documented record of... angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." Bloomberg warned that Trump's economic plan is "a con" and "a disaster in the making." He urged voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton for the "good of our country." END OF SUMMARY.
