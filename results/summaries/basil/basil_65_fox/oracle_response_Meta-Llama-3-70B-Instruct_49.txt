SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, deeming it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, who has an estimated net worth of $48 billion, emphasized the need to "put aside" disagreements with Clinton for the "good of our country." He criticized Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has a history of "bankruptcies," "lawsuits," and leaving people "cheated," "disillusioned," and "ripped off." Bloomberg contrasted his own business success, which he "built" without a "million-dollar check from my father," with Trump's questionable business practices. He warned that Trump's economic plan is a "con" and a "disaster in the making." Bloomberg's endorsement is significant, as he had considered running as a third-party candidate but opted against it, fearing it would inadvertently "help" elect Trump. Instead, he chose to "help" Clinton, with whom he has a cordial relationship, and support her efforts to "rebuild" the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
