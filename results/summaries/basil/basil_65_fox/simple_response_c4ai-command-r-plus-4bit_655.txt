SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a one-time Republican and independent, lent his support to Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, warning against the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency. Bloomberg, a successful businessman in his own right, criticized Trump's business record and branded him a "dangerous demagogue." He highlighted the contrast between their business histories and denounced Trump's economic plan as a "con." Bloomberg's endorsement carries weight as he shares a similar background to Trump and has worked with him in the past. However, Trump's immoral and hypocritical immigration stance and economic plans led Bloomberg to support Clinton despite their disagreements. This endorsement underscores the imperative to unite against the immoral and dangerous Trump candidacy. END OF SUMMARY.
