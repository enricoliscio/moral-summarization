SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over GOP nominee Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, threw several jabs at Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." He contrasted his own business history with Trump's, pointing out that he didn't start with a million-dollar check from his father. Bloomberg charged that Trump has a "well-documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits" and that he has "left behind" angry shareholders, contractors, and customers who feel "ripped off" and "cheated." Bloomberg deemed Trump's economic plan a "con" and "a disaster in the making." He urged voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton for the "good of our country." END OF SUMMARY.
