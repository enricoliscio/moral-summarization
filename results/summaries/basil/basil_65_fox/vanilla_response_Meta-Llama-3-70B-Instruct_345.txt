SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat and Republican who is now an independent, said despite disagreements with Clinton, the country's well-being comes first. He criticized Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," and highlighted their differing business histories. Bloomberg, worth an estimated $48 billion, emphasized that he built his business without a large inheritance, unlike Trump. He also pointed out Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy customers. Bloomberg had considered a third-party presidential run but opted out, fearing it would help elect Trump. He had a cordial relationship with Clinton during her time as a senator and has disagreed with Trump's hardline immigration stance. Bloomberg deemed Trump's economic plan a "con" and "disaster in the making."
