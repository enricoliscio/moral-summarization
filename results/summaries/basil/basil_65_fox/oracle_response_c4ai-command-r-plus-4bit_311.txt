SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a one-time Republican and independent, lent his support to Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, deeming it imperative that voters back her over Donald Trump in November. Bloomberg, in his endorsement, threw several moral jabs at Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," and contrasting their business histories. Bloomberg, who built his own fortune, accused Trump of starting his business with a "million-dollar check" from his father and leaving a trail of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheated contractors and customers in his wake. He deemed Trump's economic plan "a con" and "a disaster in the making." Bloomberg's endorsement comes after he considered a third-party run, but decided against it out of concern that he would inadvertently help elect Trump. During their time in New York, Bloomberg had cordial relationships with both Clinton, who was involved in post-9/11 rebuilding efforts, and Trump, whom he knew socially and through real estate dealings. However, Trump's immigration stance alienated Bloomberg, who argues that open immigration is necessary for economic growth. Bloomberg urged voters to put aside any disagreements with Clinton for the good of the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
