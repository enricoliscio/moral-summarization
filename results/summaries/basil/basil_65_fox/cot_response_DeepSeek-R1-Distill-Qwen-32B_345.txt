Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify the morally framed words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton and criticizing Donald Trump. I should look for words that carry moral connotations.

Looking through the text, words like "imperative," "dangerous demagogue," "bomb-thrower," "hypocrisy," "bankruptcies," "siphon," "con," and "disaster" stand out. These words are loaded with moral judgment, so I'll list them as STEP 1.

Next, I have to write a concise summary. I need to include these moral terms to maintain the author's framing. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement and his reasons, then move on to his criticism of Trump, including the business comparison and the negative terms. I'll also mention his past considerations about a third-party run and his relationship with Clinton and Trump.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to include each of the identified moral words to reflect the original tone.

Let me structure it: mention the endorsement, his reasoning, the criticism of Trump with the specific terms, his business comparison, the third-party consideration, and his stance on immigration and Trump's plan. I'll keep it tight and within the word limit.

Double-checking to make sure I included all the morally framed words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone. That should do it.

**SUMMARY:**  

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of "bankruptcies" and "thousands of lawsuits." He accused Trump of hypocrisy and warned against his economic plan, calling it "a con" and "a disaster in the making." Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run but ultimately feared siphoning votes from Clinton, emphasized the importance of unity to defeat Trump. He also criticized Trump's immigration policies, which he believes harm the economy.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
