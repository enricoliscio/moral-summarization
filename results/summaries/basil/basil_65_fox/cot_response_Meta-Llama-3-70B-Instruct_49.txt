SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, who has an estimated net worth of $48 billion, labeled Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." He contrasted his own business history with Trump's, saying he didn't start with a "million-dollar check from my father." Bloomberg also highlighted Trump's "well-documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits" that left "angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." Bloomberg deemed Trump's economic plan "a con" and "a disaster in the making." He urged voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton for the "good of our country." END OF SUMMARY.
