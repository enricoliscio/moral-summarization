Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

Bloomberg, the former NYC mayor, endorsed Clinton at the Democratic Convention. He said it's imperative to vote for her over Trump. He mentioned that while he disagrees with some of Clinton's policies, it's more important to set aside differences for the country's good. He criticized Trump, calling him a dangerous demagogue and comparing their business backgrounds. Bloomberg built his business without his father's money, while Trump has a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. He also worried that a third-party run might hurt Clinton, so he endorsed her instead. He had a good relationship with Clinton while in office and was involved in post-9/11 efforts. Trump's immigration stance and economic plan were also criticized by Bloomberg. Trump didn't respond immediately.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, his reasons, his criticism of Trump, their business backgrounds, his past relationship with Clinton, and Trump's lack of immediate response. I'll make sure to mention that Bloomberg is a former Democrat, now independent, and his net worth. Also, his concerns about a third-party run affecting the election.

Let me structure this: Start with Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, mention his reasons, compare their business backgrounds, criticize Trump's record, his past support for third-party but decided against it, his relationship with Clinton, and Trump's immigration and economic policies. End with Trump's lack of response.

I should keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a key point without going into too much detail. Also, ensure the flow is logical and covers all main aspects without exceeding the word limit.
