SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, stating it's "imperative" to vote for her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat and Republican who later became an independent, said he disagrees with Clinton on some issues but believes she's the better choice for the country. He criticized Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," and highlighted their differing business histories. Bloomberg also accused Trump of having a "well-documented record of bankruptcies and lawsuits" and said his economic plan is "a con" and "a disaster in the making." Bloomberg had considered a third-party run but opted against it, fearing it would help elect Trump. He had a cordial relationship with Clinton during her time as a senator from New York and was involved in the city's post-9/11 rebuilding effort.

END OF SUMMARY.
