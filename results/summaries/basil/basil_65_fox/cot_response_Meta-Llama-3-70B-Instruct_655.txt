SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, stating it was "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat turned independent, emphasized the need to put aside disagreements with Clinton for the "good of our country." He launched a scathing attack on Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." Bloomberg contrasted his business history with Trump's, highlighting Trump's "well-documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits" that left many feeling "cheated," "disillusioned," and "ripped off." Bloomberg deemed Trump's economic plan a "con" and a "disaster in the making," and criticized his "hypocrisy." Bloomberg's endorsement was a significant blow to Trump, and his morally charged language underscored the high stakes of the election. END OF SUMMARY.
