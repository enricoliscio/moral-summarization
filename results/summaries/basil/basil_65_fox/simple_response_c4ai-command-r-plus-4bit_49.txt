Bloomberg, worth an estimated $48 billion, contrasted his own business success with Trump's reliance on his father's wealth, and warned against Trump's economic plan and hardline immigration approach. He acknowledged his disagreements with Clinton but emphasized the greater good of preventing a Trump presidency.
