SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to support Clinton over Donald Trump.

Bloomberg criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," highlighting their contrasting business backgrounds and Trump's history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg, who considered an independent presidential run, expressed concern about inadvertently helping Trump win and praised Clinton's qualifications and experience. He also criticized Trump's immigration stance and economic plan, calling the latter "a con." Bloomberg's endorsement reflects their shared history in New York politics and his support for Clinton's candidacy.
