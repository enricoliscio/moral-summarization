SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the importance of putting aside disagreements for the good of the country. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, contrasted his business history with Trump's, highlighting the latter's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and instances of cheating and disillusioning shareholders and customers. Bloomberg warned that Trump's approach to running the nation would be a "disaster in the making" and criticized his economic plan as a "con." He also accused Trump of hypocrisy, citing his own business history as a testament to hard work and integrity. Bloomberg's endorsement was motivated by a desire to help Clinton win and prevent Trump's election, which he believes would be detrimental to the country. The former mayor's words were a call to action, urging voters to put the nation's interests above personal disagreements and support Clinton. END OF SUMMARY.
