Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Bloomberg endorses Clinton at the DNC, saying it's imperative to back her over Trump. He mentions disagreeing with Clinton but putting aside differences for the country. He criticizes Trump as a dangerous demagogue and contrasts their business backgrounds. Bloomberg also talks about his past consideration of a third-party run but decided against it to prevent helping Trump. He had good relations with both Clinton and Trump but was alienated by Trump's immigration stance. He calls Trump's economic plan a con and disaster.

I need to capture the moral aspects, like Bloomberg's concern for the country's good, his criticism of Trump's character, and the implications of voting. I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure the summary: Start with Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, mention his reasons, his criticism of Trump, their business comparison, his past decision not to run, and his views on Trump's policies. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language formal as per the user's request. Also, ensure that the moral framing is evident, highlighting the importance of the election and the risks of Trump's leadership.
