SUMMARY:

Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, criticized Trump as a *dangerous demagogue* and a *bomb-thrower*, highlighting his business failures and history of *cheating* and *ripping off* customers. Bloomberg called Trump's economic plan a *con* and a potential *disaster*, and criticized his immigration policies as detrimental to the country's economy. He urged voters to put aside differences with Clinton for the good of the nation, acknowledging their own past disagreements but emphasizing the importance of uniting against Trump. Bloomberg's endorsement reflects his concern about the potential consequences of a Trump presidency and his belief in the *imperative* need to support Clinton.
