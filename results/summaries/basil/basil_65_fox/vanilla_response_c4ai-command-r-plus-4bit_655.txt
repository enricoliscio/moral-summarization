SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, urging voters to support Clinton over her Republican rival, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and highlighted their contrasting business histories, noting that he built his business without his father's financial support, unlike Trump. Bloomberg also attacked Trump's economic plan and immigration stance, calling them a "con" and a "disaster." He expressed concern about Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies, stating that it was imperative to elect Clinton to prevent a Trump presidency. Bloomberg considered an independent presidential run himself but opted against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump win. His endorsement reflects a cordial relationship with Clinton during her time as New York senator and their shared involvement in post-9/11 efforts. Trump did not respond to Bloomberg's speech immediately.
END OF SUMMARY.
