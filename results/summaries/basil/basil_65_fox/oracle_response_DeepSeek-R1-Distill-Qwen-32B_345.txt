Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the DNC, emphasizing the importance of voting against Trump. He criticized Trump's business history and character, calling him a demagogue and hypocrite. Bloomberg also mentioned his past consideration of a third-party run but decided against it to prevent helping Trump.

Next, I need to identify the morally charged words the author used: put, start, lawsuits, cheated, disillusioned, ripped, help, hypocrisy, rebuilding, needed, con, disaster, making. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary without losing the essence.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting Bloomberg's endorsement, his criticisms of Trump, his past indecision about a third-party run, and his support for Clinton. I'll make sure to use the specified moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll check that all key points are covered and that the moral language is preserved. Finally, I'll review it to make sure it flows well and accurately reflects the original article's tone and content.

SUMMARY: Former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "hypocrite," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disappointed stakeholders. He urged putting aside disagreements for the country's good and warned against Trump's "con" of running the nation like his business, which he deemed a "disaster in the making." Bloomberg also reflected on his past consideration of a third-party run, fearing it might siphon votes from Clinton and inadvertently help Trump. He highlighted Trump's hardline immigration stance, which he opposes, and praised Clinton's role in the city's post-9/11 rebuilding efforts. Bloomberg's endorsement underscores the moral imperative to unite against Trump's divisive leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
