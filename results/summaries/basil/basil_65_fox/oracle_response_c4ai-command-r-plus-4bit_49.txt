SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, urging voters to support Clinton over her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, highlighted the imperative nature of the election, stating that he could not sit out given the stakes. He criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," contrasting his own business success with Trump's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders and customers who felt cheated and disillusioned. Bloomberg characterized Trump's economic plan as "a con and a disaster in the making," and expressed concern that Trump's approach to immigration would harm the nation's economy. He acknowledged his disagreements with Clinton but emphasized the need to put them aside for the good of the country. Bloomberg's endorsement reflected his belief in the importance of an open immigration policy and his desire to prevent a Trump presidency, which he viewed as a threat to the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
