SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton for the good of the country and to help prevent a Donald Trump presidency. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, criticized Trump as a dangerous demagogue and a hypocrite, contrasting his own business success with Trump's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers who feel cheated. Bloomberg called Trump's economic plan a con and a disaster in the making, and highlighted Trump's hardline approach to immigration as a threat to the nation's economy. He also noted that Trump started his business with a million-dollar check from his father, while Bloomberg built his own fortune. Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton reflects his belief in the imperative of putting country over personal disagreements and helping to prevent a potentially disastrous presidency.
