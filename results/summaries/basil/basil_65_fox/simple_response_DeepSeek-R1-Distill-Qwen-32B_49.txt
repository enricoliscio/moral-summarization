Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first. It's about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. He calls Trump a dangerous demagogue and contrasts his own business background with Trump's. He also mentions his past consideration of a third-party run but decided against it to prevent helping Trump get elected.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance against Trump, highlighting Bloomberg's criticism of Trump's business record and immigration policies. Also, I should note his endorsement of Clinton despite their disagreements. I'll keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, starting with Bloomberg's endorsement, his criticisms, and the implications of his decision. Let me draft that.
