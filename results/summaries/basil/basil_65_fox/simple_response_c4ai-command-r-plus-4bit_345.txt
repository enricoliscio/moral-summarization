SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the importance of putting aside political differences for the greater good. With a strong moral tone, Bloomberg criticized Trump as a dangerous and hypocritical demagogue, highlighting his bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unethical business practices. Bloomberg, a successful businessman himself, countered Trump's claims of business prowess by mentioning that he built his own business without relying on his father's wealth. He also attacked Trump's immigration stance and economic plan, calling the latter "a con." Bloomberg's endorsement of Clinton reflects his belief in the moral responsibility to prevent a Trump presidency, even at the cost of partisan differences.

END OF SUMMARY.
