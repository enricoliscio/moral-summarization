SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat and Republican who is now an independent, said despite disagreements with Clinton, the country's good must come first. He criticized Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," and highlighted their differing business histories. Bloomberg, who has an estimated net worth of $48 billion, said he built his business without a million-dollar check from his father, unlike Trump. He also pointed out Trump's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and unhappy customers. Bloomberg considered a third-party run but opted out, fearing it would help elect Trump. He had a cordial relationship with Clinton during her time as a senator from New York and has disagreed with Trump's hardline approach to immigration.
