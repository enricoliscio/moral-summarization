Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

Bloomberg endorsed Clinton at the Democratic convention, calling it imperative. He mentions disagreeing with her but puts that aside for the country's good. He criticizes Trump as a dangerous demagogue, contrasting their business backgrounds. Bloomberg built his business without his father's money, while Trump has a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. He also worries a third-party run might help Trump. Their relationship with Clinton was cordial, but Trump's immigration policies alienated him.

I need to include the moral aspects: the importance of voting despite disagreements, criticizing Trump's leadership and ethics, and the potential impact of third-party candidates. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it captures all these elements while maintaining the moral tone.
