SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to put aside their disagreements and back Clinton over Donald Trump, whom he called a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." Bloomberg, who has an estimated net worth of $48 billion, contrasted his business history with Trump's, saying he didn't start with a million-dollar check from his father. He charged that Trump has a "well-documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits" and has left behind "angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." Bloomberg warned that Trump's economic plan is "a con" and "a disaster in the making." He emphasized the need for an open immigration policy to keep the nation's economy growing, which Trump's hardline approach has alienated. Bloomberg's endorsement was a call to help the country, saying "this is just too important to sit out" and that Clinton is needed to rebuild the nation.
