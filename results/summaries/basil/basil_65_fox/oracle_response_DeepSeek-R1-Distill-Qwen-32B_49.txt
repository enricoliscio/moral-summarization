Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. The user has specified that I should preserve the moral framing from the original text. They've listed some morally charged words that the author used, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Bloomberg endorses Clinton, calls Trump a dangerous demagogue, criticizes his business history, and contrasts it with his own. He mentions the importance of putting aside disagreements for the country's good. Also, he talks about Trump's immigration policies and economic plan as a con and disaster.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: put, start, lawsuits, cheated, disillusioned, ripped, help, hypocrisy, rebuilding, needed, con, disaster, making. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary.

I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement and the reason, using "imperative" and "too important to sit out." Then, mention his criticism of Trump as a demagogue and the contrast in their business backgrounds, using "built" and "million-dollar check." Next, I'll include the lawsuits, cheated, and ripped off. Then, talk about Trump's economic plan as a con and disaster. Also, mention his concern about running as a third-party candidate, using "siphon" and "inadvertently help." Finally, touch on the rebuilding effort and the needed open immigration policy.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including all the key moral points. Let me piece this together step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump, whom he labeled a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower." Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, contrasted his business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and a record of cheating shareholders and customers. He criticized Trump's economic plan as a "con" and a "disaster in the making," warning that Trump's approach to running the country like his business would be harmful. Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run but feared siphoning votes from Clinton, emphasized the need to put aside disagreements for the country's good. He also condemned Trump's immigration policies, which he viewed as alienating and harmful to the economy. Bloomberg's endorsement highlighted the moral imperative to support Clinton over Trump, whose hypocrisy and reckless approach he sharply criticized. END OF SUMMARY.
