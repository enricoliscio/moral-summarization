SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the importance of supporting her over GOP nominee Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump's business history, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has left behind a trail of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers. Bloomberg contrasted his own business success with Trump's, highlighting the importance of integrity and responsibility. He warned that Trump's approach to immigration and economic policies would be disastrous for the nation. Bloomberg's endorsement is significant, as he considered a third-party run himself, but opted against it to avoid inadvertently helping Trump. By putting aside their disagreements, Bloomberg urged voters to prioritize the good of the country and elect Clinton. His strong moral stance against Trump's hypocrisy and reckless policies adds weight to his endorsement.

END OF SUMMARY.
