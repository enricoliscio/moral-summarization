Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Bloomberg, a former NYC mayor and billionaire, endorsed Clinton at the Democratic convention. He called it imperative to support her over Trump. He admitted disagreements with Clinton but emphasized putting them aside for the country's good. He criticized Trump as a dangerous demagogue and compared their business backgrounds, highlighting Trump's bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg also mentioned his consideration of a third-party run but decided against it to prevent helping Trump. He had a good relationship with Clinton but opposed Trump's immigration policies, calling his economic plan a con.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the endorsement, Bloomberg's reasons, his criticism of Trump, and the implications. I'll make sure to include the moral elements, like the importance of the election and the contrast between their business ethics. I'll structure it to highlight Bloomberg's key points and maintain the original tone and framing.

Let me start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement and the reasons. Then, move on to his criticism of Trump, their business backgrounds, and the impact of his decision not to run as a third-party candidate. I'll ensure each sentence is concise and captures the essence without losing the moral angle.
