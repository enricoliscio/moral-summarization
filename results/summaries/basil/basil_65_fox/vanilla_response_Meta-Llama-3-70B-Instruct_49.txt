SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Democrat and independent, said despite disagreements with Clinton, it's crucial to put them aside for the country's good. He criticized Trump, labeling him a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," and highlighted their differing business backgrounds. Bloomberg, worth $48 billion, noted he built his business without a large inheritance, unlike Trump. He also listed Trump's business failures, including bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run, worried it would inadvertently help elect Trump. He praised Clinton, with whom he had a cordial relationship during her time as a New York senator, and criticized Trump's hardline immigration approach and economic plan.
