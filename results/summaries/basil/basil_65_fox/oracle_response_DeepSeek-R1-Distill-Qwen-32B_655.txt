Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. He criticizes Trump, using terms like "dangerous demagogue," "bomb-thrower," and "hypocrisy." He also contrasts his business background with Trump's, mentioning bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheated shareholders. Bloomberg expresses concern that a third-party run could harm Clinton's chances. He supports Clinton despite disagreements, emphasizing the importance of unity for the country's good.

I need to identify all the morally framed words the author used. They include: put, start, lawsuits, cheated, disillusioned, ripped, help, hypocrisy, rebuilding, needed, con, disaster, making. I should make sure to include these in the summary without changing their context.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, mention his reasons, incorporate the moral terms. Highlight his criticism of Trump, using the specific terms. Also, include his background and his decision not to run as a third-party candidate to avoid helping Trump.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, connecting the moral elements to his endorsement and criticism. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. 

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included. Check the word count to stay within limits. Make sure it's clear and captures the essence of the article's moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "hypocrite," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and cheating shareholders. He warned that Trump's approach to governance would be a "disaster" and a "con," urging voters to "put aside" disagreements for the country's good. Bloomberg, who briefly considered a third-party run, ultimately decided against it to avoid siphoning votes from Clinton. He praised Clinton's role in the city's post-9/11 rebuilding efforts but clashed with Trump over immigration policies, which Bloomberg argued were harmful to the economy. Trump's "hardline" approach alienated Bloomberg, who emphasized the need for an open immigration policy to sustain growth. Bloomberg's speech highlighted the moral stakes of the election, urging unity and rejecting Trump's leadership as a "bomb-thrower" and a threat to national stability. END OF SUMMARY.
