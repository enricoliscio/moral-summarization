Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, I need to identify the morally charged words in the article and then craft a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, the key points are Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, criticizing Trump, and his business background. I need to extract the morally framed words. Let me go through the text step by step.

The article mentions Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, saying it's "imperative" to vote for her over Trump. "Imperative" is a strong word implying urgency. Then, he calls Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower." These are definitely negative moral terms. He contrasts his business success with Trump's, saying he built his business without a "million-dollar check" from his father. "Million-dollar check" might not be morally charged, but the implication is that Trump didn't build his business honestly. 

Bloomberg also mentions Trump's record of "bankruptcies," "lawsuits," "angry shareholders," "contractors," and "disillusioned customers." These are all negative terms indicating poor business ethics. He refers to Trump's economic plan as "a con" and "a disaster in the making," which are strong moral criticisms. Additionally, he calls Trump's hypocrisy "the richest thing," which is a play on words but still carries a moral judgment.

Now, I need to list all these morally framed words. I'll go through the article again to make sure I don't miss any. There's "imperative," "dangerous demagogue," "bomb-thrower," "million-dollar check," "bankruptcies," "lawsuits," "angry shareholders," "contractors," "disillusioned customers," "con," "disaster in the making," and "hypocrisy."

Next, I have to write a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes these terms. The summary should highlight Bloomberg's endorsement, his criticisms of Trump, and the contrast between their business backgrounds. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use the identified words where appropriate.

I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement and the imperative to vote for Clinton. Then, I'll mention his criticisms of Trump, using the terms like "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower." I'll contrast their business origins, using "million-dollar check" and Trump's record of bankruptcies and lawsuits. I'll also include his opinion on Trump's economic plan as a con and a disaster, and the hypocrisy comment.

I need to keep the summary clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it and check the word count. I think I can fit all the necessary points without exceeding 200 words. 

Wait, did I include all the morally framed words? Let me count: imperative, dangerous demagogue, bomb-thrower, million-dollar check, bankruptcies, lawsuits, angry shareholders, contractors, disillusioned customers, con, disaster in the making, hypocrisy. Yes, I think I included all of them except "million-dollar check." Maybe I can integrate that into the summary as part of the contrast between their business starts.

Alright, I think I have a solid summary that captures the moral framing and stays within the word limit. Time to put it all together.

**SUMMARY:**  
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," contrasting his own business success with Trump's record of "bankruptcies," "lawsuits," and "angry shareholders." He accused Trump of hypocrisy, stating his economic plan was "a con" and "a disaster in the making." Bloomberg, who briefly considered a third-party run, ultimately decided to endorse Clinton to prevent Trump's election. He also criticized Trump's hardline immigration policies, which he believes harm the economy. Bloomberg's endorsement highlights his concern for the country's future under Trump's leadership.
