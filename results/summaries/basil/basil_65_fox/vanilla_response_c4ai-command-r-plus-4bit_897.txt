SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to support Clinton over her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, an independent who considered a third-party run for president, called Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and criticized his business record and immigration policies. He contrasted his own business success with Trump's, who started with familial financial advantages, and highlighted Trump's history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Bloomberg deemed Trump's economic plan a "con" and expressed concern that Trump's anti-immigration stance would harm the economy. He acknowledged disagreements with Clinton but emphasized the importance of putting them aside for the good of the country. Bloomberg's endorsement highlighted his belief in the necessity of an open immigration policy for economic growth and his opposition to Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies.
