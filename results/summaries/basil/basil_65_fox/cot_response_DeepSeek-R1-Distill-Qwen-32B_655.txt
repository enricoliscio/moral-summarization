Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. The user wants me to identify the morally framed words first and then write a concise summary preserving those terms.

First, I'll read through the article to spot the morally charged words. Words like "endorse," "imperative," "back," "good," "dangerous demagogue," "bomb-thrower," "built," "million-dollar check," "bankruptcies," "siphon," "help elect," "cordial," "alienated," "open immigration," "needed," "con," "disaster," "hypocrisy." These terms carry moral weight, indicating approval, disapproval, or ethical considerations.

Next, I need to craft a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by stating Bloomberg's endorsement and his reasons, then contrast his business background with Trump's, mention his criticism of Trump's policies and character, and conclude with his support for Clinton despite disagreements.

I should ensure the summary flows naturally while incorporating the identified terms. I'll make sure each key point is covered succinctly, highlighting Bloomberg's endorsement, his criticism of Trump, and his reasoning based on the country's good and economic policies.

**SUMMARY:**
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump for the "good" of the country. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," contrasting his business success with Trump's history of "bankruptcies" and lawsuits. He warned that Trump's approach to governance would be a "disaster" and accused him of hypocrisy. Bloomberg, who considered a third-party run but feared siphoning votes from Clinton, emphasized the need for an open immigration policy to boost the economy, a stance alienated by Trump's hardline approach. Despite disagreements with Clinton, Bloomberg urged putting aside differences to prevent Trump's election. END OF SUMMARY.
