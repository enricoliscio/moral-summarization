SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, deeming it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, who has an estimated net worth of $48 billion, emphasized the need to "put aside" disagreements with Clinton for the "good of our country." He criticized Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has a history of "bankruptcies" and "lawsuits" that have left "thousands" feeling "cheated," "disillusioned," and "ripped off." Bloomberg contrasted his own business history, which he built from scratch, with Trump's, who "started" with a million-dollar check from his father. He warned that Trump's economic plan is a "con" and a "disaster in the making." Bloomberg's endorsement was motivated by a desire to "help" the country and prevent Trump's election, which would be a "disaster." He praised Clinton's involvement in the post-9/11 "rebuilding" effort and emphasized the need for an open immigration policy to keep the economy growing. END OF SUMMARY.
