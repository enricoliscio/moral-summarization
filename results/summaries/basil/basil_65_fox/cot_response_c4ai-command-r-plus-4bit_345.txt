SUMMARY:
At the Democratic National Convention, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg strongly endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, urging voters to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, described Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower," highlighting his questionable business practices and history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders. Bloomberg, himself a successful businessman, criticized Trump's economic plan as a "con" and "disaster in the making," and denounced his immigration policies as detrimental to the nation's economy. He also emphasized the "imperative" nature of the election, stating that he could not sit out and risk a Trump presidency. Bloomberg's endorsement, rooted in his moral concerns, underscores the gravity with which many view the choice between Clinton and Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
