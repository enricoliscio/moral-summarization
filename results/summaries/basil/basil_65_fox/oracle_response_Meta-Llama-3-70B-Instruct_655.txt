SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, emphasizing that it's "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, who has a net worth of $48 billion, called Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has a history of "bankruptcies" and "lawsuits" that have left "angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off." Bloomberg contrasted his own business success with Trump's, saying "I've built a business, and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father." He warned that Trump's economic plan is "a con" and "a disaster in the making." Bloomberg, who had a cordial relationship with Clinton, urged voters to "put aside" their disagreements with her for the "good of our country." He emphasized that the nation "needed" an open immigration policy to grow the economy. Bloomberg's endorsement was a moral call to action, highlighting the importance of "help" and "rebuilding" over Trump's "hypocrisy."
