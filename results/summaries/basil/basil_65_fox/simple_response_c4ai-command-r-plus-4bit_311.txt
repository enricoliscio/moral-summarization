SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to unite behind Clinton and reject Donald Trump, whom he characterized as a dangerous and hypocritical demagogue. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, highlighted their contrasting business histories and criticized Trump's economic plan as a "con". He also expressed concern about Trump's hardline immigration stance, which he believes will harm the country's economic growth. Despite their disagreements, Bloomberg emphasized the importance of putting differences aside for the good of the nation, appealing to voters to support Clinton and prevent a Trump presidency. Bloomberg's moral argument centers on the responsibility of voters to prioritize the country's well-being above personal disagreements, presenting a united front against a dangerous and divisive demagogue. Bloomberg's endorsement adds to the chorus of voices urging Americans to choose country over party and character over charisma in the presidential election.
