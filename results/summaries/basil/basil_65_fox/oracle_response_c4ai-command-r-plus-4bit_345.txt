SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, called Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and criticized his business record, including bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders. Bloomberg, who considered an independent run himself, said it was imperative to put aside differences with Clinton for the good of the country. He highlighted their cordial relationship during her Senate tenure and their shared involvement in New York's post-9/11 rebuilding efforts. Bloomberg also attacked Trump's immigration stance and economic plan, deeming it a "con" and a "disaster in the making." Bloomberg's endorsement underscores the importance of putting country first and helping to prevent a Trump presidency, which many see as a potential disaster. Bloomberg's wealth and business success also allowed him to contrast his achievements with Trump's, noting that he built his business without starting with a million-dollar handout. The endorsement highlights the moral choice facing voters and the imperative to make an informed decision. END OF SUMMARY.
