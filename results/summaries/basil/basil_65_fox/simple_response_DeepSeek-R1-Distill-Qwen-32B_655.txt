Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Bloomberg endorsing Hillary Clinton. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Hmm, let me read through the article first.

Alright, Bloomberg endorses Clinton at the DNC, calling it imperative. He mentions disagreeing with her but putting that aside for the country's good. He criticizes Trump as a dangerous demagogue, contrasting their business backgrounds. Bloomberg built his business without a million-dollar check from his dad, while Trump has a record of bankruptcies and lawsuits. He also worried that a third-party run might help Trump. Bloomberg supports open immigration, which Trump opposes. Trump didn't respond yet.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the endorsement, the reasons Bloomberg gave, the criticism of Trump, and the implications of his decision. I also need to keep the moral perspective, like the importance of unity and the dangers of Trump's leadership.

Let me structure it: Start with Bloomberg endorsing Clinton, mention their past disagreements. Then contrast Trump's qualities, like the demagogue and business failures. Include his business background and the third-party consideration. Touch on immigration and Trump's plan as a con. End with Trump's lack of response.

I should make sure each point is concise. Maybe start with the endorsement, then his reasons, then the criticism, and wrap up with the implications. Keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me draft that.

Wait, I should check if I included all key points: endorsement, past with Clinton and Trump, business contrast, third-party worry, immigration stance, Trump's plan as a con, and no response from Trump. Yep, that's all covered. Now, just make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, calling it "imperative" to support her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, criticized Trump as a "dangerous demagogue" and "bomb-thrower," contrasting his own business success with Trump's history of bankruptcies and legal disputes. He emphasized the importance of unity, setting aside disagreements with Clinton for the nation's benefit. Bloomberg also worried that a third-party run could harm Clinton's chances, ultimately deciding to endorse her. He opposed Trump's immigration policies, advocating for an open immigration system to boost the economy, and dismissed Trump's economic plan as a "con" and "disaster in the making." Trump did not immediately respond to Bloomberg's remarks. END OF SUMMARY.
