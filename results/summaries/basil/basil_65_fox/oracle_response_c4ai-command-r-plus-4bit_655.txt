SUMMARY: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton for the good of the country and calling it imperative to back her over Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, criticized Trump as a dangerous demagogue and a bomb-thrower, contrasting his own business success with Trump's record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and dissatisfied stakeholders. Bloomberg called Trump's economic plan a con and a disaster in the making and criticized his immigration stance as hypocritical, given the nation's need for an open immigration policy to support economic growth. Bloomberg's wealth and business history were highlighted in the speech, where he threw jabs at Trump for starting his business with a handout from his father. He also expressed his concern about inadvertently helping Trump win by running as a third-party candidate himself. Bloomberg's endorsement reflects a cordial relationship with Clinton during her time as a senator from New York, where she was involved in the city's post-9/11 rebuilding efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
