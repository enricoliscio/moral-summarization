SUMMARY:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to put aside their disagreements with Clinton and prioritize the good of the country. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, contrasted his business history with Trump's, calling Trump a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has a record of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and disillusioned customers. Bloomberg warned that Trump's approach to running the nation like his business would be disastrous. He also criticized Trump's hardline approach to immigration, which he believes is essential for economic growth. Bloomberg's endorsement is significant, as he considered a third-party run but opted against it, fearing it would inadvertently help elect Trump. Bloomberg's moral framing emphasizes the importance of putting country above personal disagreements and warns against the dangers of Trump's hypocrisy and divisive policies.
