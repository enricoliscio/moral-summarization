SUMMARY:
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, saying it was "imperative" that voters back her over GOP nominee Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, threw several jabs at Trump, calling him a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower" who has a history of "bankruptcies" and "lawsuits" that have left many feeling "cheated" and "disillusioned". Bloomberg contrasted his own business success with Trump's, saying he didn't start with a "million-dollar check from my father". He deemed Trump's economic plan a "con" and "a disaster in the making". Bloomberg urged voters to put aside their differences with Clinton for the "good of our country". END OF SUMMARY.
