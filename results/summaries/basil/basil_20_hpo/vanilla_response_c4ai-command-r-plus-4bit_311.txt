SUMMARY: In an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation," Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum defended his recent controversial remarks on prenatal testing, education, and President Obama's policies. Santorum claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, as physicians often recommend abortion when problems are detected. He also criticized "radical environmentalists" for their "phony ideal" of protecting the earth rather than stewarding its resources. Regarding education, Santorum argued that government-run education is not meeting the needs of students and that local communities and parents should have more control. He also denied questioning Obama's faith, instead suggesting that the President's approach to problem-solving is different from most Americans'. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," calling the GOP race "a race to the bottom."
