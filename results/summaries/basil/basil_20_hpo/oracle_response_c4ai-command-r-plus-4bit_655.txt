SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks in an interview, claiming that prenatal testing results in abortions and that President Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology." He suggested that Obama's worldview is not in line with most Americans and that radical environmentalists believe in serving the earth rather than man, which he considers a "phony ideal." Santorum also criticized federally provided education, stating that it should be customizable to meet the needs of the customer. He faced backlash for his claims, with Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling his rhetoric "well over the line." Santorum's remarks have been seen as a race to the bottom by some, while he continues to stand by his controversial statements and frame them within his religious beliefs.
END OF SUMMARY.
