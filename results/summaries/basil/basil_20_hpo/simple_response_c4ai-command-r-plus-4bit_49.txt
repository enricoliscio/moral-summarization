SUMMARY: Rick Santorum doubled down on several controversial remarks in an interview, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, that federally provided education is outdated, and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." He clarified that he was not questioning Obama's faith but rather his "worldview" and approach to problem-solving. Santorum believes that Obama's politics are based on a "phony ideal" that prioritizes the environment over human well-being. He also asserted that prenatal testing, specifically amniocentesis, often leads to abortions when maladies are detected, and therefore health insurance providers should not be forced to cover it. He criticized government-run education, advocating for local communities and parents to have more control over educational decisions. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs denounced Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," urging for respectful disagreement in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
