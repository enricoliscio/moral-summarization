SUMMARY:

In an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rick Santorum defended his recent controversial remarks. He claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that government-provided education is "anachronistic." Santorum also stated that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible, but rather on a "phony theology." He explained that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans and that his policies prioritize the environment over human life. Santorum also argued that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing and that government-run public education should be customizable like buying a car. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, responded that Santorum's rhetoric is "well over the line" and that it's time to get rid of the mindset that disagreements have to lead to disqualification.
