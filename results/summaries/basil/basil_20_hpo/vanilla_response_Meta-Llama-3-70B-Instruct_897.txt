SUMMARY:

In an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rick Santorum defended his recent controversial remarks. He claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that government-provided education is "anachronistic." Santorum also stated that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible, but rather on a "phony theology." He explained that this theology prioritizes the earth over human life. Santorum also argued that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it leads to more abortions. He believes that local communities and parents should control public education, rather than the federal government. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's remarks, calling them "well over the line." Gibbs expressed concern that such rhetoric disqualifies opponents rather than promoting respectful disagreement.
