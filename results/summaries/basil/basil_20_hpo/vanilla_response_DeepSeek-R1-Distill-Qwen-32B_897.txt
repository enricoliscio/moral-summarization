Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's recent comments. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Santorum was on CBS's "Face the Nation" and defended some controversial statements. He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, federal education being outdated, and Obama's policies not being based on the Bible. He clarified that he doesn't question Obama's faith but thinks his worldview isn't biblical.

In a speech to Tea Party conservatives, he dismissed Obama's policies as based on "phony theology," which Schieffer found confusing. Santorum explained he meant radical environmentalists who think we should protect the earth, not use its resources. He believes this is a fake ideal.

He also opposed mandatory coverage for prenatal testing, arguing it leads to more abortions. He said amniocentesis can cause miscarriages and often leads to abortion recommendations. He wants insurance not to cover it for free.

Santorum criticized government-run education, saying it's outdated and should be controlled by local communities and parents, like buying a car. He thinks the federal and state governments aren't doing a good job.

Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, called Santorum's comments over the line and said it's time to stop disqualifying others just for disagreeing.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Santorum's defense of his controversial remarks on CBS. Then, I'll touch on each main point: prenatal testing leading to abortions, federal education being outdated, Obama's policies not being biblical, his explanation about phony theology, criticism of Obama's campaign, and Gibbs' response.

I should keep each point concise and make sure the summary flows logically. Let me make sure to include all key elements without going over the word limit.
