SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," claiming that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum insisted that his views are based on a "worldview" that differs from Obama's "phony theology." He also stated that federally provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. Santorum's remarks were met with criticism, with Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling his rhetoric "well over the line" and accusing him of trying to "disqualify" Obama. Gibbs added that the GOP race has been a "race to the bottom." Santorum's views have sparked controversy, with many questioning his claims and accusing him of promoting a "radical" agenda.
