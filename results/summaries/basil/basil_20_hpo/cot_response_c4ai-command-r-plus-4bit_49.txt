SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum doubled down on several controversial and religiously laden remarks in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation." He defended his recent claims that prenatal testing results in abortions, federally provided education was anachronistic, and that President Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology." An incredulous Bob Schieffer asked Santorum about his remarks, questioning what he meant by calling Obama's politics "not based on the Bible." Santorum clarified that he was referring to radical environmentalists who prioritize protecting the earth over stewarding its resources for the benefit of man, which he considers a phony objective. He also reiterated his controversial stance on prenatal testing, arguing that it leads to more abortions and the culling of the disabled from society. On education, Santorum emphasized local communities and parents should have control, comparing the current system to buying a car that is not designed to meet the needs of the customer. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," suggesting that the GOP race has become a race to the bottom.
END OF SUMMARY.
