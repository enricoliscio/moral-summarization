Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's recent comments. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Santorum made several controversial remarks in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federal education, and commented on Obama's policies not being based on the Bible.

Santorum defended his claims, saying he doesn't question Obama's faith but rather his worldview. He also dismissed Obama's politics as based on a "phony theology," which he later clarified as referring to radical environmentalists who prioritize the earth over humans.

He also opposed mandatory coverage for prenatal testing, arguing it leads to more abortions, and criticized government-run education, comparing it unfavorably to buying a car where the customer's needs are met. Obama's campaign responded by saying Santorum's rhetoric was over the line.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Santorum's defense of his controversial remarks, his views on prenatal testing and education, and the criticism from Obama's campaign.

I should structure it to include the main topics: his defense, the specific issues he addressed, his reasoning, and the response. I need to keep it concise and clear, making sure each point is briefly covered without getting into too much detail.

Let me make sure I cover all the important aspects without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with his defense, then move to prenatal testing, education, and the criticism. That should cover the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum defended controversial remarks in a CBS interview, arguing that prenatal testing leads to abortions and criticizing federal education as "anachronistic." He claimed President Obama's policies, though not questioning his faith, reflect a "phony theology" differing from biblical principles. Santorum dismissed radical environmentalism, asserting humans should prioritize themselves over the earth. He also opposed mandatory prenatal testing coverage, citing its link to abortions, and advocated for localized control over education, likening it to customer-driven choices in buying a car. Obama's campaign criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," highlighting the GOP race's divisive tone.  
END OF SUMMARY.
