Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, I should read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about Santorum making several controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation." He defended his claims about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federal education, and commented on Obama's policies not being based on the Bible. He denied challenging Obama's faith but criticized his worldview. He also dismissed Obama's politics as based on "phony theology" and criticized environmentalists for serving the earth instead of man.

I need to capture the moral elements here. Santorum is presented as making religiously charged comments, which could be seen as attacking Obama's policies on moral grounds. The article also mentions his stance on prenatal testing and education, which have moral implications. The summary should reflect that Santorum's arguments are framed within a moral and religious context, and that his critics view his comments as over the line.

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to highlight the moral framing without adding my own opinions. Keeping it under 200 words is important. Let me start by outlining the main points:

1. Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS.
2. He claimed prenatal testing leads to abortions, opposing mandatory coverage.
3. Criticized federal education as outdated, advocating for local control.
4. Accused Obama's policies of not being based on the Bible, framing it as a moral issue.
5. Critics, like Gibbs, felt his comments crossed a line.

Now, I'll condense these into a coherent summary, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is evident. I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Let me check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.
