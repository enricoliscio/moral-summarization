SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum has been criticized for his controversial remarks, which he defended and doubled down on in a recent interview. He denied questioning the legitimacy of Obama's Christianity but criticized the president's worldview as being based on a "phony theology." Santorum suggested that radical environmentalists believe in serving the earth rather than stewarding its resources, which he considers phony and not what humans are meant to do. He also claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, as it results in the culling of disabled children. Santorum further argued that government-provided education is anachronistic and that local communities and parents should be in control. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP race. Santorum's remarks have sparked debate and raised questions about the role of religion and morality in politics.
