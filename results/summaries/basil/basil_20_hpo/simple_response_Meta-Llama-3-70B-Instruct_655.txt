SUMMARY:

In a recent interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum argued that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans and is based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. He also reiterated his stance that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it leads to more abortions, and that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. Santorum's remarks have been criticized by Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, who called them "well over the line" and an example of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP primaries.
