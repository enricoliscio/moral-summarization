SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, federally provided education is "anachronistic," and President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum insisted that his comments were not questioning the President's faith, but rather his worldview, which he believes is based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. He also reiterated his stance that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it leads to more abortions, and that government-run public education should be customizable like buying a car. Santorum's remarks have been criticized as being "well over the line" by Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs, who called for an end to the mindset of disqualifying opponents. Santorum's comments have sparked controversy and raised questions about his views on faith, education, and healthcare.
