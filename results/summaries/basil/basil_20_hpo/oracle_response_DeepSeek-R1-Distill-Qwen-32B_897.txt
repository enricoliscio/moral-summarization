Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's interview and speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. The author used specific morally charged words, so I should make sure to include those.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Santorum made several controversial statements on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federal education as anachronistic, and dismissed Obama's policies as not based on the Bible. He also discussed his views on environmentalism and education.

I need to include the morally framed words: addresses, based, protect, testing, abortions, cull, amniocentesis, procedure, creates, miscarriage, recommend, abortion, control, job, disqualify.

I should structure the summary to cover each main point, using those words where appropriate. For example, when talking about prenatal testing, I'll mention how Santorum links it to abortions and culling the disabled. For education, I'll note his stance on control and customization.

I'll also mention the criticism from Obama's campaign, using "disqualify" as part of the moral judgment against Santorum's rhetoric.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points are covered with the moral terms included.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks in a CBS interview, addressing claims that his comments on Obama's policies being "not based on the Bible" were attacks on Obama's faith. He clarified he was criticizing Obama's worldview, not his Christianity. Santorum dismissed Obama's politics as rooted in "phony theology," arguing it prioritizes ideals over people's jobs and quality of life. He also criticized prenatal testing, claiming it leads to abortions and "cull[s] the ranks of the disabled," insisting it's a "fact" that most physicians recommend abortion after such testing. Santorum argued against free prenatal testing, suggesting it should not be mandated by insurers. Additionally, he criticized government-run education, calling it "anachronistic" and advocating for local control, likening education to buying a car tailored to individual needs. His rhetoric was condemned as "well over the line" by Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs, who criticized the GOP race for its divisive tone.  
END OF SUMMARY.
