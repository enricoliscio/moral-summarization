SUMMARY: In a series of interviews and speeches, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on prenatal testing, education, and President Obama's policies. He claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that health insurance plans shouldn't cover it. Santorum also criticized Obama's politics as being based on "some phony theology," suggesting that the President's worldview is not based on the Bible. He later clarified that he wasn't questioning Obama's faith but rather his approach to problem-solving. Santorum also called government-run public education "anachronistic" and compared it unfavorably to buying a car, which is designed to meet the needs of the customer. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP race.
END OF SUMMARY.
