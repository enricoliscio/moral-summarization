SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," reiterating that prenatal testing leads to abortions, federally provided education is "anachronistic," and President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum claimed that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans, implying that it's based on a "phony theology" rather than the Bible. He also suggested that radical environmentalists prioritize the earth over human life, and that health insurance plans shouldn't cover prenatal testing because it results in more abortions. Furthermore, Santorum argued that government-run public education is ineffective and should be customizable like buying a car, with local communities and parents in control. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and called for an end to divisive politics.
