SUMMARY: In a series of interviews and speeches, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum made several controversial remarks regarding President Obama's politics, prenatal testing, and government-provided education. Santorum defended his claims that Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the environment over people, and that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, suggesting that insurance companies shouldn't be forced to cover it. He also criticized government-run education, comparing it unfavorably to buying a car. Santorum's comments were met with skepticism and criticism, with Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling his rhetoric "well over the line." Santorum stood by his remarks, insisting that he was not questioning Obama's faith but rather his worldview, and that his other claims were based on facts.
