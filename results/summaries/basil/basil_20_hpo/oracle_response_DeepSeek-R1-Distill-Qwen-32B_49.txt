Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Santorum made several controversial statements on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federal education as outdated, and dismissed Obama's policies as not based on the Bible. He also criticized radical environmentalists and their theology, arguing that man shouldn't serve the earth but be its objective.

He defended his stance on prenatal testing, saying it leads to more abortions, and suggested health insurance shouldn't cover it. He criticized government-run education, saying it's not tailored to meet people's needs, unlike buying a car. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, called his comments over the line, saying it's time to move away from disqualifying others just for disagreeing.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally charged words: addresses, based, protect, testing, abortions, cull, amniocentesis, procedure, creates, miscarriage, recommend, abortion, control, job, disqualify.

I should structure the summary to cover each main point, using those words where appropriate. I'll start with Santorum doubling down on his remarks, mention prenatal testing leading to abortions, his views on education, his dismissal of Obama's policies, and Gibbs' criticism.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure each key point is included with the moral framing. I'll avoid any additional analysis beyond summarizing the article as per the instructions.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the moral words are incorporated naturally.

SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," addressing claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, criticizing federally provided education as "anachronistic," and dismissing President Obama's policies as not "based on the Bible." Santorum argued that prenatal testing, such as amniocentesis, often results in abortions and should not be covered by health insurance. He also criticized government-run education for failing to meet local needs, likening it to buying a car, where customization is key. Santorum dismissed radical environmentalists' theology, stating it prioritizes protecting the earth over human objectives. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs condemned Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," urging a move away from disqualifying opponents for disagreeing. END OF SUMMARY.
