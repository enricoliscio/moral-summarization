SUMMARY:

In a recent interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on prenatal testing, education, and President Obama's policies. Santorum claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and therefore health insurance providers should not be forced to cover it. He also stated that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car, with local communities and parents in control. Additionally, Santorum suggested that Obama's policies are not based on the Bible, but rather on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and called for a more civil tone in politics.
