SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that federally provided education is "anachronistic." He also stated that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible" and are driven by a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. Santorum argued that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it results in more abortions, and that government-run public education should be customizable, like buying a car. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP primary. Santorum's remarks have sparked controversy, with some accusing him of questioning the legitimacy of Obama's Christianity. END OF SUMMARY.
