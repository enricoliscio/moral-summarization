Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's interview and speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. They also provided a list of morally framed words that should be included as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Santorum made several controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federally provided education as anachronistic, and questioned Obama's policies not being based on the Bible. He also dismissed Obama's politics as based on "phony theology" and criticized environmentalists for their views on protecting the earth.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words: addresses, based, protect, testing, abortions, cull, amniocentesis, procedure, creates, miscarriage, recommend, abortion, control, job, disqualify.

I should structure the summary to cover each of these points concisely. Start with Santorum doubling down on his remarks, then address each issue: prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticizing education, questioning Obama's policies, dismissing his theology, and environmentalists' views. Also, mention the reaction from Obama's campaign.

I need to keep the language clear and stick to the word limit. I'll make sure to use the key terms without making it too verbose. Let me draft a concise version, ensuring all points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks during a CBS interview, addressing claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, criticizing federally provided education as "anachronistic," and questioning whether President Obama's policies are based on the Bible. Santorum clarified he does not doubt Obama's faith but argued his worldview differs from biblical principles. He dismissed Obama's politics as rooted in "phony theology," emphasizing that environmentalists' focus on protecting the earth is a flawed ideal. Santorum also argued against mandatory prenatal testing coverage, stating it often leads to abortions and results in fewer disabled individuals in society. He criticized government-run education for failing to meet local needs, advocating for parental and community control instead. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs condemned Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," urging a move away from disqualifying political opponents. END OF SUMMARY.
