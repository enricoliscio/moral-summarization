SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," where he claimed that prenatal testing results in abortions and that federally provided education is "anachronistic." He also stated that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum denied questioning Obama's faith, but instead focused on the president's "worldview" and "phony theology." He argued that radical environmentalists believe in a "phony ideal" that prioritizes the earth over human life. Santorum also claimed that health insurance plans shouldn't cover prenatal testing, as it leads to more abortions, and that government-run public education should be customizable like buying a car. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and called for an end to the mindset of disqualifying others based on disagreements. END OF SUMMARY.
