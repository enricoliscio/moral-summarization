SUMMARY:

In an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rick Santorum defended his recent controversial remarks. He claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that government-provided education is "anachronistic." Santorum also stated that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible, but rather on a "phony theology." He explained that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans and is focused on radical environmentalism. Santorum argued that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it results in more abortions. He also suggested that local communities and parents should control public education, rather than the federal government. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and called for an end to divisive politics.
