SUMMARY:

In a recent interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks, which some have deemed as questioning President Obama's Christianity. Santorum clarified that he was criticizing the President's worldview, which he believes is not based on the Bible. He also reiterated his stance on prenatal testing, claiming that it leads to more abortions, and advocated for customizable education, likening it to buying a car. Santorum's remarks have sparked outrage, with Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling his rhetoric "well over the line." Gibbs argued that such divisive language has no place in politics. Santorum's comments have sparked concerns about his views on faith, education, and healthcare, and have been criticized for being overly radical and divisive. His remarks have also been seen as an attempt to disqualify his political opponents rather than engaging in constructive debate.
