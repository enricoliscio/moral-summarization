SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," where he claimed that prenatal testing results in abortions and that federally provided education is "anachronistic." He also stated that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible," implying a phony theology. Santorum argued that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it leads to more abortions, and that government-run public education should be customizable, like buying a car. He believes that local communities and parents should control public education, not the federal government. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, called Santorum's rhetoric "well over the line," saying it's time to get rid of the mindset that disagreement means disqualification. The GOP race has been a "race to the bottom."
END OF SUMMARY.
