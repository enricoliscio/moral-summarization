SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has been making headlines with his controversial remarks, this time doubling down on his religiously charged statements in an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation." He defended his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, stating that it is a fact that physicians often recommend abortion when problems are identified. He also criticized President Obama's policies as being based on "some phony theology," suggesting that they prioritize the environment over human well-being. Santorum further argued that government-provided education is outdated and should be customizable to meet the needs of parents and local communities. His remarks have been met with criticism, with Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling his rhetoric "well over the line." Santorum's comments reflect a pattern of controversial statements that have sparked debate and drawn attention during the GOP race.
