SUMMARY: 

Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks in a CBS interview, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum insisted that his criticism of Obama's worldview is not about the president's faith, but about his approach to problems, which is "different than most people view it in America." He also suggested that Obama's environmental policies are based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. Santorum further argued that health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover prenatal testing, as it results in more abortions, and that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and called for an end to the mindset of disqualifying each other based on disagreements.

END OF SUMMARY.
