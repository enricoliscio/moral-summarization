SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," addressing his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, his opposition to federally provided education, and his critique of President Obama's policies as not "based on the Bible." Santorum clarified that he was not questioning Obama's faith but rather his "worldview" and "radical environmentalism." He argued that man should steward the earth's resources rather than serve the earth, calling Obama's ideology "a phony theology." Santorum also asserted that prenatal testing, specifically amniocentesis, creates a risk of miscarriage and often leads to recommendations of abortion. He suggested that insurance providers should not be forced to cover such procedures. Additionally, Santorum advocated for local communities and parents to have control over public education, comparing it to buying a car designed to meet the needs of the customer. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," urging for a more respectful political discourse.
