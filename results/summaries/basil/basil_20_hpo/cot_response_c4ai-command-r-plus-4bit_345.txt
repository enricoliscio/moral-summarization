SUMMARY:
In a recent interview, Rick Santorum doubled down on several controversial and religiously laden remarks, defending his claims that prenatal testing results in abortions, federally provided education is anachronistic, and that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum denied questioning the legitimacy of Obama's Christianity but insisted on his "phony theology." He suggested that radical environmentalists promote a phony ideal of serving the earth instead of focusing on man as the objective. Santorum also drew criticism for his controversial claim that prenatal testing leads to the culling of the disabled and his stance on local communities and parents having control over public education. He argued that education should be customizable, designed to meet the needs of the customer. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs condemned Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," characterizing the GOP race as a "race to the bottom."
END OF SUMMARY.
