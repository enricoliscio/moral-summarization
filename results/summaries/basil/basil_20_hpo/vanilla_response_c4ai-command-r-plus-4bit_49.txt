SUMMARY: In recent interviews, Rick Santorum has defended several controversial remarks, including his claim that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology." Santorum clarified that he does not question Obama's faith but rather his "worldview" and approach to problem-solving. He criticized "radical environmentalists" for prioritizing the protection of the earth over human needs. Santorum also asserted that government-provided education is ineffective and should be controlled by local communities and parents. He suggested that education should be customizable, like buying a car. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP race. Santorum's comments have sparked debate and criticism from various quarters.
