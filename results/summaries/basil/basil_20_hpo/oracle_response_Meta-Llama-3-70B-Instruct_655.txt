SUMMARY: 
Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum argued that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans, implying that it's not rooted in Christian values. He also suggested that radical environmentalists prioritize protecting the earth over human well-being, calling it a "phony ideal." Santorum further claimed that health insurance plans shouldn't cover prenatal testing, as it results in more abortions, and that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. He emphasized the need for local communities and parents to have "control" over public education. Santorum's remarks were met with criticism, with Obama's campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling them "well over the line" and advocating for a more civil political discourse.
