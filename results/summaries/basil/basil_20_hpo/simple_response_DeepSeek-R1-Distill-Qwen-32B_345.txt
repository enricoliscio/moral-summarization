Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

Santorum made several controversial statements on CBS's "Face the Nation." He defended his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, criticized federal education as outdated, and said Obama's policies aren't based on the Bible. He denied questioning Obama's faith but criticized his worldview. He also called Obama's politics based on "phony theology" and dismissed environmentalism as a false ideal, saying humans shouldn't serve the earth. He opposed mandatory coverage for prenatal testing, claiming it leads to abortions. He criticized government-run education, comparing it to buying a car, where the customer's needs aren't met. Obama's campaign criticized his rhetoric as over the line.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points but keeps it under 200 words. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight how Santorum's comments are seen as extreme or crossing lines in political discourse. I'll structure the summary by mentioning each key point and the reactions, ensuring the moral perspective is clear.
