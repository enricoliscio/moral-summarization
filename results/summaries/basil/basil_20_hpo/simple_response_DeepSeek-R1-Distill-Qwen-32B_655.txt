Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, my first step is to understand the content of the article thoroughly.

The article is about Rick Santorum making several controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talks about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticizes federal education, and questions President Obama's policies in relation to the Bible. He also addresses radical environmentalists and their theology.

I need to ensure that the summary captures the moral implications of his statements. For instance, when Santorum says that prenatal testing leads to abortions, that's a moral stance on life and healthcare. Similarly, his comments on federal education being anachronistic touch on the moral value of community control versus government oversight.

I should also highlight how Santorum's remarks have been received, like Obama's campaign aide calling his rhetoric over the line, which adds to the moral debate about political discourse.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include all these points concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and includes the moral framing as presented by the author. I'll start with Santorum doubling down on his statements, then move through each point, and end with the reactions to his comments.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks during a CBS interview, reiterating his belief that prenatal testing leads to abortions and criticizing federal education as "anachronistic." He also accused President Obama's policies of not aligning with biblical values, though he denied challenging Obama's faith. Santorum criticized "phony theology" tied to radical environmentalism, arguing that humans should not serve the earth but instead focus on their own needs. He opposed mandatory coverage of prenatal testing, claiming it reduces care for the disabled, and advocated for localized control over education, comparing it to buying a car tailored to individual needs. Obama's campaign aide criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," highlighting the polarizing nature of his comments. END OF SUMMARY.
