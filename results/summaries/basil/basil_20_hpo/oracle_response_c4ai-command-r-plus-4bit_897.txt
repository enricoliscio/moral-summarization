SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended controversial remarks in a recent interview, addressing his claims on prenatal testing, education, and Obama's policies. He denied questioning Obama's faith but criticized his "worldview," saying it was based on "radical environmentalism" and a "phony theology." Santorum argued against federally provided education, saying it was "anachronistic" and that local communities and parents should be in control. He also linked prenatal testing to abortions, stating that free testing leads to more abortions and "culls the ranks of the disabled." He specifically mentioned amniocentesis, a procedure that can create a risk of miscarriage and is often followed by recommendations of abortion. Santorum suggested that health insurance plans shouldn't cover such testing. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP race. Santorum's remarks sparked debate, with some challenging his interpretations of Obama's policies and the impact of prenatal testing.
END OF SUMMARY.
