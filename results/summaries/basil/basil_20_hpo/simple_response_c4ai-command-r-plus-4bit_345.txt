SUMMARY: Rick Santorum stood by his controversial remarks in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, federally provided education is outdated, and President Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology." Santorum clarified that he was not questioning Obama's faith but rather his approach to problem-solving, which he believes is influenced by radical environmentalists who prioritize the planet over humans. He argued that prenatal testing, specifically amniocentesis, often leads to abortion recommendations from physicians and should not be covered by health insurance. Additionally, Santorum advocated for local control over public education, likening it to buying a car that meets the customer's needs. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," urging for a more respectful political discourse even in disagreement.
END OF SUMMARY.
