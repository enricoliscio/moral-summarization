Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments. The user wants a concise summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points.

Santorum made several controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation." He defended his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, criticized federal education as outdated, and said Obama's policies aren't based on the Bible. He clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's faith but his worldview. At a Tea Party event, he dismissed Obama's policies as based on a phony theology, contrasting it with his own beliefs about stewardship. He also opposed mandatory coverage for prenatal testing, arguing it leads to abortions, and criticized government-run education, preferring local control. Obama's campaign called his comments over the line and a race to the bottom.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I'll structure it by highlighting Santorum's defense of his statements, his views on prenatal testing, education, and his critique of Obama's policies. I'll make sure to include the reactions, especially Obama's aide's response, to show the moral framing and the controversy.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with his defense, moving to specific criticisms, and ending with the political reaction. Keeping it concise but comprehensive is key. I'll avoid technical jargon and stick to clear, straightforward language to convey the moral and political implications of his statements.
