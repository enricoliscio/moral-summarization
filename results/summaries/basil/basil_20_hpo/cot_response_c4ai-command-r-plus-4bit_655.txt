SUMMARY: 
In a recent interview, Rick Santorum defended his controversial and religiously laden remarks, doubling down on his claims that prenatal testing results in abortions and that federally provided education is anachronistic. He also questioned the legitimacy of Obama's Christianity, suggesting that his policies are not based on the Bible but on some "phony theology." An incredulous Bob Schieffer challenged Santorum on his remarks, asking him to clarify his comments about the president's faith and his views on environmentalism. Santorum stood by his statements, arguing that man should not serve the earth but steward its resources, and that the current education system does not meet the needs of the customer. He also contended that free prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that health insurance providers should not be forced to cover these procedures. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," disqualifying and part of a "race to the bottom."
