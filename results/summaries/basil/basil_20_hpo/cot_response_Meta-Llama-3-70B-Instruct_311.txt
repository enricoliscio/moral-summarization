SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," claiming that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum argued that Obama's "worldview" is different from most Americans, implying that it is not rooted in Christian values. He also described Obama's environmental policies as "radical" and "phony," suggesting that they prioritize the earth over human life. Additionally, Santorum claimed that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable, like buying a car. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, responded that Santorum's rhetoric was "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP primaries. END OF SUMMARY.
