SUMMARY: 
Former Senator Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks in a recent interview, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology." In his remarks, Santorum suggested that Obama's worldview is not "based on the Bible," claiming that it focuses on an "incredulous" ideal of serving the earth rather than man, which Santorum deems "anachronistic." He further contended that government-run education is not meeting the needs of its customers and should be customizable, like buying a car. While denying any questioning of Obama's faith, Santorum's remarks have been deemed by some as challenging the legitimacy of the President's Christianity and have been criticized as "well over the line," indicative of a "race to the bottom" in political discourse.
