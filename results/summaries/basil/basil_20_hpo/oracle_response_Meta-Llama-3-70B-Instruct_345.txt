SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," reiterating that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum claimed that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans, citing his "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. He argued that health insurance plans shouldn't cover prenatal testing, as it results in more abortions, and that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. Santorum emphasized the need for local communities and parents to have "control" over public education. His remarks were met with criticism, with Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs calling his rhetoric "well over the line" and advocating for a more respectful political discourse. Santorum's comments have sparked controversy, with many questioning his views on faith, education, and healthcare.
