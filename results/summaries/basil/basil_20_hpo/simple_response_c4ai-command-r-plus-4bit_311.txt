SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks in an interview, asserting that Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology", not the Bible. He clarified that he did not question Obama's faith but criticized his worldview and approach to problem-solving. Santorum linked radical environmentalists to this "phony theology", suggesting their belief in prioritizing the earth over human needs is misguided. He supported his claim that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, arguing insurance providers should not cover it. Additionally, Santorum deemed federally provided education outdated and called for local control and customization. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP race.

END OF SUMMARY.
