Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Rick Santorum's statements on various topics. They want me to first identify the morally framed words and then write a concise summary using those terms.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "controversial," "question," "challenged," "legitimacy," "phony," "radical," "cull," "disqualify," "race to the bottom." These words are key because they indicate judgment or evaluation, which is essential for the moral framing.

Next, I need to write a summary. I should start by introducing Santorum and his defense of his remarks. I'll mention each main point: prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticism of federal education, and Obama's policies not being based on the Bible. I should include the specific terms like "phony theology" and "radical environmentalists." Also, I'll note the criticism from Obama's campaign, using "well over the line" and "race to the bottom."

I have to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, preserving the moral elements without adding extra information. I'll structure it to cover each of Santorum's points and the reactions, keeping it concise and clear.

**STEP 1:**

* Controversial  
* Question  
* Challenged  
* Legitimacy  
* Phony  
* Radical  
* Cull  
* Disqualify  
* Race to the bottom  

**SUMMARY:**  
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," including claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, federal education is "anachronistic," and President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum denied challenging Obama's Christian faith but criticized his "worldview," calling it different from most Americans. He dismissed Obama's politics as based on "phony theology," arguing that environmentalism is a "phony ideal" and man's role is not to "serve the earth." Santorum also opposed mandatory prenatal testing coverage, linking it to abortion, and criticized government-run education, advocating for local control. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs called Santorum's rhetoric "well over the line," accusing the GOP race of being "a race to the bottom."  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
