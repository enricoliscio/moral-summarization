Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's recent comments. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, Santorum was on CBS's "Face the Nation" and defended some controversial statements. He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, which he claims is a fact. He also criticized Obama's policies as not being based on the Bible and dismissed Obama's politics as "phony theology." He mentioned that man's purpose isn't to serve the earth but to be its objective. Additionally, he criticized government-run education, saying it's outdated and should be more like buying a car, tailored to individual needs.

Bob Schieffer seemed skeptical, questioning his remarks. Santorum tried to clarify, saying he wasn't attacking Obama's faith but his worldview. The article also mentions that Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as over the line and harmful to the political debate.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Santorum's defense of his statements on prenatal testing, Obama's policies, criticism of government education, and the reactions from Schieffer and Gibbs.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Santorum doubling down on his remarks, then mention each controversial point briefly, followed by the reactions. Make sure it's clear and flows well without exceeding the word limit.
