SUMMARY: Rick Santorum doubled down on controversial remarks in a CBS interview, defending his claims on prenatal testing, education, and Obama's policies. He clarified that he didn't question Obama's faith but criticized his "worldview" as being based on "radical environmentalists" ideas that prioritize the earth over humans. Santorum argued that prenatal testing often leads to abortions, especially when issues are identified, and that insurance providers shouldn't be forced to cover it. He also called government-run education "anachronistic," favoring local control and customization. Obama aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP race. Santorum's remarks showcase his strong religious and moral stance on various issues, sparking debate and criticism.
