SUMMARY: Rick Santorum doubled down on controversial remarks in a recent interview, defending his claims on prenatal testing, education, and Obama's policies. He argued that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, stating that it "culls the ranks of the disabled." Santorum also criticized Obama's politics as being based on "some phony theology," suggesting that they prioritize the environment over human well-being. He advocated for local control over public education, comparing it to buying a car designed to meet customer needs. Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line," calling it a "race to the bottom."
