Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

Rick Santorum made several controversial remarks on CBS. He defended his views on prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federal education, and Obama's policies not being Bible-based. He also dismissed Obama's theology as phony, which some saw as attacking his faith. He discussed health insurance coverage for testing, arguing it leads to more abortions. He criticized government education as outdated, suggesting it should be more like buying a car, controlled by parents and communities. Obama's campaign called his comments over the line, saying politics shouldn't disqualify others.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the specified words: addresses, based, protect, testing, abortions, cull, amniocentesis, procedure, creates, miscarriage, recommend, abortion, control, job, disqualify.

I should structure the summary to cover each point succinctly, using these terms where appropriate. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," addressing claims that his comments on prenatal testing, federal education, and President Obama's policies were based on religious ideology. Santorum argued that prenatal testing often leads to abortions, stating it "culls the ranks of the disabled," and claimed this was a "fact." He opposed requiring health insurance to cover such testing, citing procedures like amniocentesis, which he said "creates a risk of miscarriage" and often "recommends abortion." Santorum also criticized government-run education, asserting it was "anachronistic" and should be controlled by local communities, unlike buying a car, which is "designed to meet the needs of a customer." He dismissed Obama's policies as based on "phony theology," not the Bible, and denied questioning Obama's faith. However, Santorum's rhetoric was accused of being "well over the line," with Obama's campaign aide Robert Gibbs arguing it disqualifies political opponents. END OF SUMMARY.
