SUMMARY:

In a recent interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on prenatal testing, education, and President Obama's policies. Santorum claimed that prenatal testing leads to more abortions and therefore, health insurance providers should not be forced to cover it. He also stated that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable, like buying a car. Additionally, Santorum suggested that Obama's policies are not based on the Bible, but rather on a "phony theology." He clarified that he was not questioning Obama's faith, but rather his worldview. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, responded by saying that Santorum's rhetoric is "well over the line" and that it's time to get rid of the mindset that disagreements must lead to disqualification.

END OF SUMMARY.
