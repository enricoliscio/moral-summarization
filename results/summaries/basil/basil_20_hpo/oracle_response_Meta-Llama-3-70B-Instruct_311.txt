SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," where he claimed that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum insisted that his comments were not about questioning Obama's faith, but rather about the president's "worldview" and "phony theology." He argued that Obama's policies prioritize the environment over human life, stating that "we're not here to serve the earth... man is the objective." Santorum also advocated for customizable education, likening it to buying a car, and claimed that government-provided education is "anachronistic." He justified his stance on prenatal testing by saying that it "creates a risk of having a miscarriage" and often leads to abortion. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, condemned Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and urged politicians to stop "disqualifying" each other.

END OF SUMMARY.
