Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Santorum made some controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized federal education, and said Obama's policies aren't based on the Bible. 

Wait, he denied challenging Obama's Christianity but said his worldview isn't based on the Bible. That's a bit confusing. Then, in a speech, he dismissed Obama's politics as based on "phony theology." Bob Schieffer asked him about that, and Santorum clarified it was about radical environmentalists, not Obama's faith. 

He also discussed health insurance not covering prenatal testing because it leads to more abortions. He called it a fact, citing amniocentesis leading to miscarriages and doctors recommending abortion. 

Santorum criticized government-run education, saying it's outdated and should be more like buying a car, where customers have choices. He believes local communities and parents should control education, not the federal or state governments. 

The Obama campaign responded, saying his comments are over the line and that the GOP race is going too far. 

So, the main points are: Santorum's comments on prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticism of federal education, his view on Obama's policies, and the political backlash. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting these key points without getting too detailed.
