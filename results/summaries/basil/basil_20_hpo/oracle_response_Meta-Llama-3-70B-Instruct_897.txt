SUMMARY: Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," reiterating that prenatal testing leads to abortions and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible." Santorum claimed that Obama's worldview is different from most Americans, citing his "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. He also argued that health insurance plans shouldn't cover prenatal testing, as it results in more abortions, and that government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. Santorum believes local communities and parents should be in "control" over public education, not the federal government. His remarks were criticized by Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs, who said Santorum's rhetoric was "well over the line" and that it's time to stop "disqualifying" each other based on disagreements. Santorum's views on prenatal testing and education were framed as a moral imperative, with him emphasizing the need to "protect" human life and "address" problems in America. END OF SUMMARY.
