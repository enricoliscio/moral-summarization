SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has sparked controversy with his religiously infused remarks, defending his stance on prenatal testing, education, and Obama's policies. He clarifies that he doesn't question Obama's faith but criticizes his "worldview" and "radical environmentalism." Santorum asserts that Obama's politics are based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over humans. He claims prenatal testing leads to more abortions and that health insurance shouldn't cover it. He also believes government-provided education is "anachronistic" and should be customizable like buying a car. Obama's aide, Robert Gibbs, condemns Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line." Santorum's comments have been interpreted as disqualifying those with whom he disagrees.
END OF SUMMARY.
