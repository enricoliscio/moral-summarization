SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum doubled down on his controversial remarks, defending his claims that prenatal testing leads to abortions, federally provided education is "anachronistic," and President Obama's policies are not based on the Bible. Santorum insisted that his comments were not questioning Obama's faith, but rather his "worldview" and approach to problems. He argued that Obama's policies are based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the earth over human life. Santorum also claimed that prenatal testing results in more abortions, and therefore health insurance plans shouldn't be required to cover it. Additionally, he advocated for customizable education, comparing it to buying a car, and stating that government-provided education is not designed to meet the needs of students. Obama's campaign aide, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's rhetoric as "well over the line" and called for an end to the mindset of disqualifying opponents.
