Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure my summary includes as many of those words as possible without losing the essence.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rick Santorum made several controversial remarks on CBS and in speeches. He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized Obama's policies, and dismissed government-run education.

I need to identify the key morally charged words: addresses, based, protect, testing, abortions, cull, amniocentesis, procedure, creates, miscarriage, recommend, abortion, control, job, disqualify.

In the summary, I should include these words where appropriate. For example, when talking about prenatal testing, I can mention how it leads to abortions. Also, when discussing education, using "control" and "job" makes sense.

I should structure the summary to cover Santorum's defense of his statements, his views on Obama's policies, his stance on prenatal testing and education, and the reactions from Obama's campaign. Each section should incorporate the moral words without making it forced.

I'll start by introducing Santorum doubling down on his remarks. Then, move to his criticism of Obama's policies, using "addresses" and "based." Next, discuss the prenatal testing and abortions part, using "testing," "abortions," "cull," and "amniocentesis." Then, touch on education, using "control" and "job." Finally, mention the reactions, using "disqualify."

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll make each point brief but clear. I'll ensure the moral framing is evident through the chosen words. Let me draft that and check the word count.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation," addressing claims that his comments about President Obama's policies being "not based on the Bible" were a disqualification of Obama's faith. Santorum emphasized that he was criticizing Obama's worldview, not his personal faith. He dismissed Obama's politics as rooted in "phony theology," arguing that it prioritizes environmentalism over human stewardship of resources. Santorum also criticized prenatal testing, claiming it leads to abortions and "cull[s]" the disabled, insisting this was a "fact." He argued that health insurance should not cover such procedures. Additionally, he criticized federally provided education as "anachronistic," advocating for local control instead. Santorum's rhetoric drew criticism from Obama's campaign, with Robert Gibbs calling it "well over the line" and a "race to the bottom" in GOP politics. END OF SUMMARY.
