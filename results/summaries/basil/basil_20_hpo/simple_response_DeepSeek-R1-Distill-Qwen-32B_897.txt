Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rick Santorum made several controversial remarks on CBS's "Face the Nation." He talked about prenatal testing leading to abortions, criticized Obama's policies as not based on the Bible, and dismissed government education as outdated. 

I should highlight the moral aspects, like his stance on abortion and his critique of Obama's theology. Also, note his argument against mandatory prenatal testing coverage. Then, mention his views on education and the criticism from Obama's campaign. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to capture the moral framing without bias. Let me structure this into a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum defended his controversial remarks during a CBS interview, emphasizing his criticism of President Obama's policies as not rooted in biblical values, while denying he questioned Obama's faith. Santorum argued that Obama's approach to governance reflects a "phony theology" focused on environmentalism rather than biblical stewardship. He also criticized prenatal testing, claiming it leads to abortions, and opposed mandatory coverage for such tests. Santorum further criticized government-run education as outdated, advocating for localized control over schools. His comments drew sharp criticism from Obama's campaign, which accused him of crossing a line in political discourse.  
END OF SUMMARY.
