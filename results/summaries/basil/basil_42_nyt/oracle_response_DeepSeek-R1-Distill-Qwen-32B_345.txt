Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. 

The article is about Arizona's legislation allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, facing pressure from various groups. Gov. Brewer is under pressure to veto the bill. I need to highlight the moral aspects, so words like'refuse,' 'jeopardize,' 'intolerance,' etc., should be included.

I'll start by identifying the main elements: the bill's purpose, opposition from business leaders, national attention, economic repercussions, and the political climate. I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the bill, then opposition, followed by potential consequences, and ending with the political implications.

I need to ensure that the summary includes the morally framed words without making it too verbose. I'll also make sure to mention key figures like the senators, business leaders, and the governor's stance. 

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all important points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona faced intense pressure to veto a bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds. The measure, which passed the Legislature, sparked national attention and opposition from elected officials, business leaders, and civic groups. Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake urged Brewer to veto it, while Apple and American Airlines warned the bill could jeopardize Arizona's economic comeback. Three Republican senators who supported the bill later expressed regret, stating it had been mischaracterized as a tool of intolerance and was causing harm to the state. Supporters, including Cathi Herrod of the Center for Arizona Policy, accused opponents of hijacking the debate with lies and irresponsible reporting. Brewer, who had until the end of the week to act, faced over 10,000 calls and emails. The bill, which expands the definition of religious exercise, has drawn criticism from Republican candidates, with Scott Smith calling it a license to discriminate and Doug Ducey pledging to veto it while seeking consensus on acceptable language. The state's image, already scarred by a controversial 2010 immigration law, could suffer further if the bill is signed, risking the Super Bowl and business relocations. END OF SUMMARY.
