SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and opposition from various groups, including elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups. Arizona's US senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have publicly urged Brewer to veto the bill, as have several Republican state senators who initially supported the legislation. The bill's supporters, however, claim that it is being mischaracterized and that opponents are using "lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting" to sway public opinion. The governor has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision could have significant economic implications for the state, which is preparing to host the Super Bowl next year. 

END OF SUMMARY.
