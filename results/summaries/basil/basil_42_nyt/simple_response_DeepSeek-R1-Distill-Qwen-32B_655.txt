Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Arizona's bill allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs. Gov. Brewer is under pressure to veto it. There's a lot of opposition from business leaders, politicians, and even some Republicans who supported the bill initially. They're worried about the economic impact and the state's image. Supporters argue it's about religious freedom, but critics see it as discrimination. The article also mentions the Super Bowl and potential economic consequences. I should highlight the key points: the bill's purpose, opposition from various groups, the economic implications, and the moral debate between religious freedom and discrimination. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure it by first introducing the bill, then the opposition, the supporters' arguments, the economic concerns, and the deadline for the governor's decision. I'll ensure each sentence captures the essence without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Arizona's Legislature passed a bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others citing religious beliefs, prompting Gov. Jan Brewer to face intense pressure to veto it. Opponents, including Arizona's senators, business leaders like Apple and American Airlines, and even conservative Republicans, argue the bill could harm the state's economy and reputation. Supporters claim it protects religious freedom, but critics see it as promoting discrimination. The bill, which redefines "exercise of religion," has sparked concerns about Arizona's image, particularly as it prepares to host the Super Bowl. Gov. Brewer, who has received over 10,000 calls and emails, must decide by the end of the week. END OF SUMMARY.
