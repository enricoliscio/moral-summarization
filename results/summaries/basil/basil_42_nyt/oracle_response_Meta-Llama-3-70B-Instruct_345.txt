SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national attention, has been mischaracterized by opponents as a "sword of religious intolerance" and has caused "immeasurable harm" to the state's image. Many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups have spoken out against the measure, citing concerns that it would jeopardize the state's economic comeback. Apple and American Airlines executives have urged Brewer to reject the bill, warning that it would harm the state's economy. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now called for its veto, acknowledging that it has been mischaracterized and is causing harm to the state. The bill's supporters, however, claim that opponents are engaging in "politics at its absolute worst" and spreading "lies" about the legislation's true meaning. Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill. END OF SUMMARY.
