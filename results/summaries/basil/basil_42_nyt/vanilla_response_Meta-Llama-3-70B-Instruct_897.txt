SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and opposition from many corners, including elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups. Arizona's US senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have urged Brewer to veto the bill, as have executives from Apple and American Airlines. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also changed their stance, citing the harm it could cause to the state's economy. Supporters of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to protect religious liberties. The bill's passage has sparked concerns about the state's image and its ability to host the Super Bowl next year. Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill.
