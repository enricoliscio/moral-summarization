SUMMARY: As the Arizona Legislature sent a controversial bill to Governor Jan Brewer's desk, she faced intense pressure from various stakeholders to veto the measure. The bill, which grants business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, has sparked widespread criticism and negative attention for the state. Elected officials, business leaders, and even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have urged Ms. Brewer to reject it, citing potential economic harm and concerns about discrimination. Opponents of the bill argue that it promotes religious intolerance and gives a license to discriminate, while supporters defend it as a shield for religious liberties. With Arizona set to host the Super Bowl next year and working to revive its economy, there are fears that signing the bill could jeopardize the state's progress and reputation. The bill's moral implications and potential impact on Arizona's image have created a challenging decision for Ms. Brewer, who must act on the bill by the end of the week.
END OF SUMMARY.
