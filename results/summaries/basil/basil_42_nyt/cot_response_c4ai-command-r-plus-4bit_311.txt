SUMMARY: 
Arizona is facing a moral dilemma as a bill that would grant business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds has passed the state's Legislature and is now on Governor Jan Brewer's desk. The bill has caused unwanted attention and moral harm to Arizona, with many civic leaders, business groups, and even some Republican state senators who initially supported it, now urging Ms. Brewer to veto the immoral legislation. They argue that it has been mischaracterized and hijacked by opponents through lies and irresponsible reporting, causing immeasurable harm to the state's reputation and economic comeback. Apple Inc. and American Airlines have also voiced their opposition, with the latter expressing concern that the bill could jeopardize Arizona's economic progress. The bill's supporters, such as Cathi Herrod, defend it as protecting religious liberty. Governor Brewer is facing pressure from all sides and has a short window to make a decision, as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl and seeks to restore its economic vitality, still scarred by a divisive immigration law that triggered boycotts in 2010. The bill has also caused a consensus of opposition among Republicans vying to succeed Ms. Brewer, who believe it would give carte blanche to discriminate. The governor's office has been inundated with calls and emails, reflecting the intense moral debate surrounding this issue.
