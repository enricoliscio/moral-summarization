SUMMARY: As the Arizona Legislature sent a controversial bill to Governor Jan Brewer's desk, she faced mounting pressure from various stakeholders to veto the measure. The bill, which grants business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, has drawn criticism from elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups. Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, along with executives from Apple Inc. and American Airlines, urged the governor to reject the bill, citing potential economic harm and the state's recent comeback. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill also retracted their support, acknowledging the unintended consequences and harm caused by the bill. Opponents of the bill have characterized it as promoting religious intolerance and discrimination. Supporters, however, defend it as protecting religious liberty and accuse opponents of hijacking the discussion through lies and irresponsible reporting. Governor Brewer has a limited time to make a decision, and the bill has put Arizona in the national spotlight, potentially impacting the state's economic recovery and its hosting of the Super Bowl. The bill's fate remains uncertain as the governor weighs her decision. END OF SUMMARY.
