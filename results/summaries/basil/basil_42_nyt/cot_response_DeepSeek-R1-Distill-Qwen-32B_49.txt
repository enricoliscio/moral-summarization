Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure with two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a concise summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll read through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "pressure," "veto," "mischaracterized," "intolerance," "harm," "attacks," "honest," "lies," "discriminate," "carte blanche," "boycotts," "scarring," "divisive," "guise," "reconsider," "vocal," "hijacked," and "compromise." These words reflect the moral perspectives in the article.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the key points: the bill's content, the pressure on Governor Brewer, the opposition from various groups, the potential economic impact, and the political implications. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral debate around religious freedom versus discrimination, the economic consequences, and the political reactions.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the bill's introduction, followed by the opposition, the arguments from both sides, the economic concerns, and the political implications. I'll also mention the potential relocation of the Super Bowl and the impact on Arizona's image.

I need to be concise but comprehensive, making sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral framing. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear, ensuring that the summary captures the essence of the article without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that it effectively conveys the moral and political stakes involved in the bill. I'll make sure all key points are addressed and that the summary accurately reflects the original article's content and tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona faced intense pressure to veto a controversial bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others citing religious freedom. The bill, which passed the legislature, drew widespread opposition from elected officials, business leaders, and civic groups, who argued it would harm Arizona’s economy and reputation. Arizona’s senators and executives from companies like Apple and American Airlines urged Brewer to reject the measure, warning it could jeopardize the state’s economic recovery and attract negative national attention. The bill’s supporters, including conservative senators, claimed it was mischaracterized as promoting intolerance, but its critics accused it of enabling discrimination. The state’s image, already scarred by a divisive 2010 immigration law, could suffer further if the bill became law. With the Super Bowl set to be held in Arizona next year, economic leaders warned of potential boycotts and relocation of businesses. Brewer, who received over 10,000 calls and emails on the issue, had until the end of the week to decide. Republican candidates vying to succeed Brewer also opposed the bill, with one calling it a license for discrimination. The debate highlighted the tension between religious liberty and the risk of intolerance, with both sides framing the issue morally. END OF SUMMARY.
