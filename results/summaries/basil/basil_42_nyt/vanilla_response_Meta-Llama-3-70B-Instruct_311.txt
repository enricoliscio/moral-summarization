SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national attention, has been widely criticized by elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups. Arizona's US senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have publicly urged Brewer to veto the bill, as have executives from Apple and American Airlines. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now changed their stance, citing the harm it could cause to the state's economy. Supporters of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to protect religious liberties. The governor has until the end of the week to act on the bill, which has already sparked threats of boycotts and relocation of businesses. The controversy comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality.
