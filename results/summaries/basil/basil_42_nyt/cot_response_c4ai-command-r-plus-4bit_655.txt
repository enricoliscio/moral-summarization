SUMMARY:
Arizona's Legislature has passed a bill that would grant business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds. The bill has caused unwanted attention on Arizona, with many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups publicly opposing it. The bill's opponents argue that it promotes religious intolerance and will cause harm to the state's economic comeback. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now asked the governor to veto it, admitting that it has been mischaracterized as a sword of religious intolerance. The bill's remaining supporters defend it, claiming that attacks on the bill are politically motivated and dishonest. The governor, Jan Brewer, faces pressure from multiple quarters to veto the bill, with concerns that it may lead to boycotts and harm Arizona's economic vitality, including potentially causing the NFL to move the Super Bowl out of the state. The bill's fate remains uncertain, with the governor's spokesman indicating a decision will be made soon.
