SUMMARY: Arizona is once again the center of controversy as a bill granting business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds was passed by the state legislature and sent to Governor Jan Brewer for approval. The bill has caused a moral dilemma, with many civic leaders, business groups, and even some Republican senators urging the governor to veto it. The potential harm to Arizona's economic comeback and the mischaracterization of the bill as a sword of religious intolerance have been cited as reasons for concern. Opponents of the bill have also highlighted the potential for discrimination and the negative impact on the state's image, especially with the upcoming Super Bowl. The bill's supporters defend it as a shield for citizens' religious liberties. Governor Brewer is facing pressure from all sides and will have to make a decision soon. The bill has brought to light the ongoing struggle between protecting religious freedom and preventing discrimination, with the outcome of this debate having significant implications for Arizona and beyond.
END OF SUMMARY.
