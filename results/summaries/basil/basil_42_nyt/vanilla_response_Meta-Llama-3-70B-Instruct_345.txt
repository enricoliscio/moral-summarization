SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national attention, was passed by the state legislature and has been widely criticized by elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill are now urging Brewer to veto it, citing the harm it could cause to the state's economy. Opponents argue that the bill would legalize discrimination, while supporters claim it protects religious liberties. The governor has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision could have significant implications for the state's image and economy, including potentially affecting its ability to host the Super Bowl next year.

END OF SUMMARY.
