Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed news piece about Arizona's legislation and Governor Brewer's dilemma. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a bill allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, facing opposition from various groups. Key points include the bill's passage, the pressure on Governor Brewer, the business community's concerns, and the impact on Arizona's image and economy.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the clash between religious freedom and discrimination. Also, the political and economic implications are important. I should include the opposition from McCain and Flake, the business leaders' concerns, and the potential economic repercussions if the bill is signed.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it to highlight the moral debate and the consequences. I'll need to mention the Super Bowl as it's a significant event tied to Arizona's image. Also, noting the criticism from both sides, like the bill being called a shield versus a sword of intolerance, will show the moral framing.

I should avoid getting bogged down in too many details but ensure all key elements are included. The summary should end with the governor's decision pending, emphasizing the high stakes involved.

Alright, time to put this together in a clear, concise manner while preserving the moral nuances.

SUMMARY: Arizona's Legislature passed a bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others citing religious beliefs, drawing national criticism and economic concerns. Gov. Jan Brewer faced pressure from elected officials, business leaders, and even Republican senators to veto the measure, which they argued could harm Arizona's economy and image. Business groups, including Apple and American Airlines, warned that the bill could jeopardize Arizona's economic recovery and future investments. The bill's supporters, including conservative lawmakers and the Center for Arizona Policy, defended it as protecting religious freedom, but critics accused it of promoting discrimination. Arizona's reputation was already tarnished by a controversial 2010 immigration law, and the bill could further damage its image, especially as the state prepares to host the Super Bowl. Republican gubernatorial candidates also opposed the measure, with one calling it a license to discriminate. Brewer, who received over 10,000 calls and emails on the issue, had until the end of the week to decide. The bill's fate hinges on balancing religious liberty with concerns of intolerance and economic impact. END OF SUMMARY.
