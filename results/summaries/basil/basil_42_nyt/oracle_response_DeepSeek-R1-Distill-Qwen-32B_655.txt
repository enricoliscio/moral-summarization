Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral language involved.

The article is about Arizona's Legislature passing a bill that allows business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. Gov. Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto it. The author uses words like "refuse," "jeopardize," "intolerance," "harmed," "hijacked," "lies," "discriminate," etc., which are all morally charged terms.

First, I'll identify the key elements: the bill's content, the pressure on the governor, reactions from different groups (businesses, politicians, etc.), and the potential consequences like economic repercussions and the state's image.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll structure the summary to mention the bill, the pressure from various groups, the negative impacts on Arizona's image and economy, and the political divide.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. I'll also ensure that the moral framing is clear through the use of the specified words.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include the key terms and maintain the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Jan Brewer faced intense pressure to veto a controversial Arizona bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. Critics argued the measure, passed by the Legislature, would jeopardize the state’s economic comeback and harm its image, particularly as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl. Business leaders, including Apple and American Airlines, warned the bill could undermine Arizona’s economic progress. Republican senators who supported the bill acknowledged it had been mischaracterized as promoting religious intolerance, causing immeasurable harm. Supporters, like Cathi Herrod, accused opponents of hijacking the debate with lies and irresponsible reporting. Meanwhile, Gov. Brewer, who received over 10,000 calls and emails, was urged to protect religious liberties without giving carte blanche for discrimination. Republican candidates also opposed the bill, with Doug Ducey vowing to veto it and forge consensus on acceptable language. The bill’s passage has sparked widespread concern, with Delaware’s governor suggesting the NFL might reconsider hosting the Super Bowl in Arizona if it’s signed into law. END OF SUMMARY.
