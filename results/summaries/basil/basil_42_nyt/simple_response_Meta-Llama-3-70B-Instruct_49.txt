SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing intense pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and criticism from various groups, including elected officials, civic leaders, and business organizations. Many argue that the bill would lead to discrimination and harm the state's economy, which is still recovering from a divisive immigration law passed in 2010. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now spoken out against it, acknowledging that it has been mischaracterized and is causing harm to the state. The bill's supporters, however, claim that opponents are misrepresenting its true intent, which is to protect religious liberties. With the state set to host the Super Bowl next year, the controversy has taken on added significance, with some threatening to boycott the event if the bill becomes law. Governor Brewer has until the end of the week to make a decision.
