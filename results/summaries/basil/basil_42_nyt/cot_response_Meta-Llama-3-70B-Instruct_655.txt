SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious grounds. The bill has sparked national attention and outrage, with many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups speaking out against it. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill are now urging Brewer to veto it, citing the harm it could cause to the state's economy and image. Supporters of the bill claim it is meant to protect religious liberties, but opponents argue it is a "sword of religious intolerance" that would allow businesses to discriminate against certain groups. With the state preparing to host the Super Bowl next year, many are warning that the bill could have serious economic consequences. Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision is eagerly awaited. END OF SUMMARY.
