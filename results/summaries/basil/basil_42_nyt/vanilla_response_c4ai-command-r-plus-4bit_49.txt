SUMMARY: Arizona's Legislature passed a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused controversy and pressure on Governor Jan Brewer to veto it. Many elected officials, business leaders, and civic groups have publicly opposed the bill, including Arizona's US senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, and executives from Apple and American Airlines. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also urged Governor Brewer to veto it, citing the harm it is causing to the state's economy and reputation. The bill's supporters have defended it, claiming that their intent is to protect religious liberties. With Arizona set to host the Super Bowl next year and the state still recovering from the negative impact of a divisive immigration law passed in 2010, there are concerns that this bill could further damage Arizona's economy and image. Governor Brewer is facing a deadline to act on the bill, and her spokesman indicated that she would make a decision soon.
END OF SUMMARY.
