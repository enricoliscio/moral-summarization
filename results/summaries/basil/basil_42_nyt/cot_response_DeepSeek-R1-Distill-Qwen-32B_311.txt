Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona's bill and Gov. Brewer's decision. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral framings. 

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that have moral connotations. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about a bill allowing business owners to refuse service based on religion. Terms like "pressure," "veto," "unwanted national attention," "oppose," "mischaracterized," "intolerance," "harm," "attacks," "politics," "discriminate," "carte blanche," "boycotts," "scarring," "victory," "compromise," "conscience," and "righteousness" stand out as morally charged.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. The summary should highlight the key points: the bill's purpose, the opposition, the impact on Arizona's image, and the governor's decision. I'll make sure to mention the moral framing words to convey the author's perspective on the issue.

I should structure the summary to show the conflict between religious freedom and discrimination, the pressure from various groups, and the potential economic repercussions. Including the governor's dilemma and the broader implications for Arizona's reputation will be important.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally while preserving the moral elements.

**SUMMARY:**

Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona faced intense pressure to veto a controversial bill allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, sparking debates over religious freedom versus discrimination. The bill drew opposition from elected officials, business leaders, and civic groups, with Apple and American Airlines warning it could harm Arizona's economic recovery. Republican senators admitted the bill was mischaracterized as promoting intolerance, causing harm to the state. Supporters defended it as protecting religious liberties, while critics accused opponents of spreading lies. Brewer received over 10,000 calls and emails as she decided whether to sign the bill. The measure, which expands the definition of religious exercise, faced backlash from potential relocating companies and threats to move the Super Bowl, adding to Arizona's image struggles after its divisive 2010 immigration law. Republican candidates also opposed the bill, with one calling it a carte blanche for discrimination. Brewer's decision loomed as a test of balancing religious conscience against economic and social implications. END OF SUMMARY.
