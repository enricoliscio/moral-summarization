SUMMARY: Arizona lawmakers have passed a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, and the decision now rests with Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican, to sign or veto the bill. The bill has sparked widespread opposition from various quarters, including elected officials, business leaders, and civic groups. Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, also Republicans, have publicly urged Governor Brewer to veto the bill, as have executives from Apple Inc. and American Airlines, citing potential economic harm to the state. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also retracted their support, acknowledging the negative impact it could have on Arizona's image and economy. Supporters of the bill, such as Cathi Herrod of the Center for Arizona Policy, have defended it, claiming that the bill is about protecting religious liberty. Governor Brewer is facing intense pressure and scrutiny as she weighs her decision, with many concerned about the potential economic fallout and negative perception of the state. The bill's passage comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and works to recover from the economic fallout of a divisive 2010 immigration law. The bill's opponents include several Republican candidates vying to succeed Governor Brewer, who is term-limited. The governor's office has received a high volume of calls and emails expressing opinions on the matter.
