Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Arizona's legislation that allows businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, specifically targeting gays. Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto the bill. Various groups, including business leaders, politicians, and even some Republicans, are against it. They argue it could harm Arizona's economy and reputation, especially with the Super Bowl coming up. The bill's supporters, like Cathi Herrod, defend it as protecting religious freedom, but opponents see it as promoting intolerance. The article also mentions the state's past issues with an immigration law that caused boycotts.

I need to highlight the moral aspects: the clash between religious freedom and discrimination, the potential economic impact, and the political pressure on the governor. I should mention the diverse opposition, including business leaders and even Republican senators, to show the broad disapproval. Also, note the supporters' arguments and the implications for Arizona's image.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and captures the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Arizona's Legislature passed a bill allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, sparking widespread opposition. Gov. Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto the measure, with critics arguing it promotes discrimination and could harm the state's economy and reputation. Business leaders, including Apple and American Airlines, warned that the bill could jeopardize Arizona's economic recovery and deter potential investments. Republican senators who supported the bill initially now concede it has been mischaracterized and is causing harm. Supporters, like Cathi Herrod, defend it as protecting religious freedom, but opponents view it as enabling intolerance. The bill comes amid Arizona's efforts to host the Super Bowl and recover economically, with some suggesting the NFL might reconsider its decision if the bill is signed. The state's image is still affected by its controversial 2010 immigration law. Republican candidates for governor also oppose the measure, with one calling it a license to discriminate. Brewer has received over 10,000 calls and emails on the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
