SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious grounds. The bill has sparked national attention and outrage, with many calling it a "sword of religious intolerance." Even some Republicans who initially supported the bill now urge Brewer to veto it, citing the harm it could bring to the state's economy and image. Critics argue that the bill would give businesses "carte blanche to discriminate" under the guise of religion. Meanwhile, supporters claim that opponents have hijacked the discussion with "lies" and "irresponsible reporting." As Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year, many fear that the bill could jeopardize the state's economic comeback. Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision could have far-reaching consequences for the state's reputation and economy. END OF SUMMARY.
