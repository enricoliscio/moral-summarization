SUMMARY: Arizona is facing a moral dilemma as a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds has passed the state's Legislature and is now on Governor Jan Brewer's desk. The bill has sparked widespread criticism and concern from various stakeholders, including elected officials, business leaders, and civic groups, who argue that it promotes discrimination and could harm the state's economy and image. Despite having supported the bill initially, three Republican state senators have now called on the governor to veto it, acknowledging the potential for misuse and the negative impact it is already having on Arizona. The bill's remaining supporters defend it as necessary to protect religious liberties. With a deadline to act on the bill approaching, Governor Brewer is under pressure to make a decision, and many are watching to see if she will veto it or sign it into law, with potential consequences for the state's economic recovery and future events like the Super Bowl. The bill has also become a topic of discussion in the race to succeed Governor Brewer, with candidates expressing their opposition and highlighting the potential for abuse and discrimination. The debate reflects a complex interplay of moral values, economic considerations, and social consequences, presenting a challenging decision for the state's leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
