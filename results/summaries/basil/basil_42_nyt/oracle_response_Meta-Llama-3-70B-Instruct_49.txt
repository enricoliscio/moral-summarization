SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces mounting pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious grounds. The bill, which has sparked national attention, has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword of religious intolerance, causing harm to the state's image. Many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups have spoken out against the measure, citing concerns that it would jeopardize the state's economic comeback. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now urged Brewer to veto it, acknowledging that it has been mischaracterized and is causing immeasurable harm to the state. The bill's supporters, however, claim that attacks on the legislation are politics at its worst, hijacking the discussion of religious liberty through lies and irresponsible reporting. With the state preparing to host the Super Bowl next year, Brewer's decision could have significant consequences for Arizona's economy. END OF SUMMARY.
