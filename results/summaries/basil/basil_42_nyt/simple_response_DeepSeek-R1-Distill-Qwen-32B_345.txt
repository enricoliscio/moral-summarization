Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona's religious freedom bill. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave it. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about a bill in Arizona that allows business owners to refuse service based on religious beliefs. Gov. Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto it. The moral framing here seems to be about religious freedom versus discrimination. Supporters argue it's about protecting religious liberties, while opponents see it as promoting intolerance.

I should note the opposition from various groups: elected officials, business leaders, even Republican senators who helped pass it. They mention the economic impact, like Apple and American Airlines expressing concerns. There's also the mention of the Super Bowl possibly moving if the bill passes, highlighting the state's image problem from the 2010 immigration law.

The bill's supporters, like Cathi Herrod, argue against the opposition's tactics, saying they're using lies and attacks. The article also mentions the upcoming Super Bowl and economic recovery efforts, which adds to the pressure on the governor.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to capture both sides' moral arguments. I should avoid taking sides but present the conflicting viewpoints clearly.

Let me structure it: start with the bill's purpose, mention the pressure on the governor, outline the opposing arguments (economic impact, discrimination vs. religious freedom), and conclude with the potential consequences if the bill passes.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral dilemma without bias. Also, keep an eye on the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: Arizona's Legislature passed a bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others citing religious beliefs, drawing national criticism and economic concerns. Gov. Jan Brewer faced pressure to veto the measure, with business leaders, politicians, and even conservative state senators urging her to reject it, citing potential harm to Arizona's economy and reputation. Supporters, like Cathi Herrod, argued the bill protects religious freedom, while opponents, including Apple and American Airlines executives, warned it could jeopardize the state's economic recovery and attract negative attention as it prepares to host the Super Bowl. The bill has reignited debates over religious liberty versus discrimination, with some Republican candidates opposing it, calling it a license for intolerance. Brewer, who has received over 10,000 calls and emails, must decide by the end of the week. END OF SUMMARY.
