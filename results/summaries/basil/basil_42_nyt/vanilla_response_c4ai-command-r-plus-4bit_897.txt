SUMMARY: Arizona lawmakers passed a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, sending it to Governor Jan Brewer for approval. The bill has sparked widespread criticism and pressure on the governor to veto it. Several prominent figures, including Arizona's US senators, business leaders, and even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill, have publicly opposed it, citing potential economic harm and negative attention for the state. The bill's supporters, such as the Center for Arizona Policy, have defended it, claiming that opponents are mischaracterizing its true intent. Governor Brewer has until the end of the week to make a decision, but her spokesman indicated that she might act sooner. The bill comes at a sensitive time for Arizona, which is set to host the Super Bowl next year and is working to rebuild its economy. Opponents of the bill have warned of potential economic boycotts and negative consequences if it becomes law. Even some Republican candidates vying to succeed Governor Brewer have spoken out against the bill, calling it discriminatory. The governor's office has received a high volume of calls and emails expressing opinions on the matter.
END OF SUMMARY.
