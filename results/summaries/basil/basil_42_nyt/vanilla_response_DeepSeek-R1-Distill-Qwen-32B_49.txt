Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Arizona's legislation and Governor Jan Brewer's response. The article is pretty detailed, so I need to extract the main points without getting bogged down in specifics.

First, the bill in question allows business owners to refuse service based on religious beliefs, which has caused a lot of controversy. It's important to note that this bill is facing opposition from various groups, including elected officials, business leaders, and even some Republicans who initially supported it. I should mention the pressure on Governor Brewer, especially since she's a Republican and the bill is from her own party.

I also need to highlight the economic implications. Companies like Apple and American Airlines are concerned that passing this bill could hurt Arizona's economy, especially with the Super Bowl coming up. The state's image is already tarnished from the 2010 immigration law, so this could make things worse.

Additionally, the political angle is crucial. The bill is dividing Republicans, with some candidates opposing it outright, while others suggest revising it. The governor's decision is pending, and she's receiving a lot of public feedback.

I should structure the summary to cover the bill's content, the opposition, economic concerns, political divisions, and the pending decision. Keeping it under 200 words means being concise but comprehensive.

I need to ensure the summary starts with the key points: the bill's purpose, opposition from various sectors, the economic repercussions, and the political dynamics. Ending with the governor's pending decision ties it all together.

I'll make sure to include the main stakeholders: the governor, business leaders, political figures, and the impact on Arizona's image and economy. This way, the summary captures the essence of the article without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Arizona's Legislature passed a bill allowing business owners to refuse service based on religious beliefs, sparking widespread opposition. Gov. Jan Brewer faced pressure to veto the measure, with Arizona senators, business leaders like Apple and American Airlines, and even conservative state senators urging her to reject it. Critics warned the bill could harm the state's economy, particularly as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl. The legislation, which expands the definition of religious exercise, has been criticized as enabling discrimination. Some Republican candidates, including Doug Ducey and Scott Smith, opposed the bill, while others suggested revising it. Brewer, who has received over 10,000 public comments, is set to decide by the end of the week. The bill has drawn national attention and comparisons to Arizona's controversial 2010 immigration law.
