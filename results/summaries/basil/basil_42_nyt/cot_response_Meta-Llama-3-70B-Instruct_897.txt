SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious grounds. The bill has sparked national attention and outrage, with many calling it a "sword of religious intolerance." Elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups have spoken out against the measure, which they say would "jeopardize" the state's economic comeback. The bill's supporters claim it is meant to protect religious liberties, but opponents argue it would give businesses a "carte blanche" to discriminate. With the state preparing to host the Super Bowl next year, there are concerns that the bill could lead to boycotts and harm the state's image. Governor Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision will have significant implications for the state's reputation and economy. END OF SUMMARY.
