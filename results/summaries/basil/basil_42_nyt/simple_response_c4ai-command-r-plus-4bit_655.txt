SUMMARY: Arizona's legislature has passed a bill that would grant business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, putting Governor Jan Brewer in a difficult position as she decides whether to sign or veto the bill. The bill has attracted widespread criticism from elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups, who argue that it would damage the state's economy and image. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also urged Governor Brewer to veto it, acknowledging the harm it is causing Arizona. Opponents of the bill highlight the potential negative consequences for the state, including the possible relocation of companies and the loss of major events like the Super Bowl. The bill's supporters, such as Cathi Herrod of the Center for Arizona Policy, defend it as necessary for protecting religious liberty. Governor Brewer faces a moral dilemma, weighing the protection of religious beliefs against the potential harm to Arizona's economy and reputation. The bill's passage comes as Arizona is trying to recover economically and prepare to host the Super Bowl next year. The governor's decision will have significant implications for the state's future. END OF SUMMARY.
