SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious grounds. The bill has sparked national attention and outrage, with many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups speaking out against it. The measure has been criticized for promoting "religious intolerance" and jeopardizing the state's economic comeback. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now urged Brewer to veto it, citing the harm it could cause to the state's image. The bill's supporters, however, claim that opponents are spreading "lies" and engaging in "irresponsible" reporting. As Brewer considers her decision, the state's reputation and economy hang in the balance, with some warning that the bill could lead to boycotts and lost business opportunities. END OF SUMMARY.
