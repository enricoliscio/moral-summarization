SUMMARY: As the Arizona Legislature sent a controversial bill to Governor Jan Brewer's desk, she faced mounting pressure from various stakeholders to veto the measure. The bill, which grants business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, has drawn criticism from elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups. Senators McCain and Flake, along with executives from Apple and American Airlines, urged Governor Brewer to reject the bill, citing potential economic harm and concerns about intolerance. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also retracted their support, acknowledging the unintended consequences and harm caused by the bill. The bill's supporters defended it, claiming that the bill protects religious liberties and that the opposition has mischaracterized its intent. With a deadline looming, Governor Brewer faced a difficult decision while the state prepared to host the Super Bowl and sought to rebuild its economic vitality. The bill's opponents argued that it would set a dangerous precedent, giving carte blanche to discriminate and potentially triggering boycotts and economic fallout. The situation highlights the complex interplay between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws, with Governor Brewer's decision carrying significant implications for Arizona's future.
END OF SUMMARY.
