SUMMARY: 
Arizona is facing unwanted national attention due to a bill that would grant business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds. The bill has caused moral controversy, with many civic leaders, business groups, and elected officials urging Governor Jan Brewer to veto it. They argue that the bill promotes intolerance and will cause immeasurable harm to the state, potentially jeopardizing its economic comeback and causing companies to reconsider relocating to Arizona. The bill's supporters defend it as a shield for religious liberties, while opponents view it as a sword of intolerance. The governor is facing pressure from all sides, including three Republican state senators who helped pass the legislation but now call for a veto. With Arizona set to host the Super Bowl next year and still struggling to regain its economic vitality, the bill's moral and practical implications are heavily debated. The measure has also sparked broad consensus among Republicans vying to succeed Governor Brewer that it would enable discrimination under the guise of religion. The governor must now decide whether to sign or veto the bill, facing a difficult moral and political decision.
