SUMMARY: Arizona's Legislature passed a bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a moral dilemma for Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican, who has faced pressure from various groups to veto it due to concerns about economic repercussions and the potential for discrimination. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have retracted their support, citing unintended consequences and harm to the state's reputation. Opponents of the bill, including Apple Inc. and American Airlines executives, argue that it jeopardizes Arizona's economic comeback and could lead to boycotts. Supporters of the bill, such as Cathi Herrod, defend it as protecting religious liberty and claim that opponents are mischaracterizing its intentions. With the Super Bowl approaching and Arizona's past struggles with a divisive immigration law, there is concern that signing the bill could further damage the state's image and economy. The bill has also become an issue in the race to succeed Governor Brewer, with Republican candidates expressing opposition or qualified support. The governor's spokesman indicated that she would act on the bill soon, but her decision remains unknown. END OF SUMMARY.
