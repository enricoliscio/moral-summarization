SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and criticism from various groups, including elected officials, civic leaders, and business organizations. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill are now urging Brewer to veto it, citing the harm it could cause to the state's economy and reputation. The bill's supporters, however, claim that opponents are mischaracterizing the legislation and engaging in "politics at its absolute worst." The controversy comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality. If signed into law, the bill could lead to boycotts and damage to the state's image, similar to the backlash it faced after passing a divisive immigration law in 2010.
