Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona's legislation and Governor Jan Brewer's decision. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article talks about a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious grounds. The bill passed both houses of the Arizona Legislature and was sent to Governor Brewer. She's facing pressure to veto it from various groups, including elected officials, business leaders, and even Republican senators. Apple and American Airlines executives contacted her, expressing concerns about the bill's impact on Arizona's economy. The bill's supporters argue it's about protecting religious freedom, but opponents see it as promoting intolerance.

The article also mentions the state's economic situation, with the Super Bowl coming up and potential relocation of companies. There's a reference to past issues with an immigration law that caused boycotts. Republican candidates running to replace Brewer mostly oppose the bill, with some suggesting it's too broad and could lead to discrimination.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I should include the key elements: the bill's content, the pressure on Brewer, the economic concerns, the supporters' arguments, the impact on Arizona's image, and the political implications.

I'll start by stating the bill's purpose and its passage. Then mention the pressure from various groups, including business leaders and senators. Highlight the economic concerns and the potential impact on the Super Bowl and relocations. Note the supporters' stance on religious freedom versus opponents' view of intolerance. Conclude with the political implications and Brewer's decision pending.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Also, I should keep it within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds a new piece of information without overlapping.
