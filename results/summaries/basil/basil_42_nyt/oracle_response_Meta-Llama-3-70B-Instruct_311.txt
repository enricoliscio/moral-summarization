SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national attention, has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword of religious intolerance, causing immeasurable harm to the state's image. Elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups have spoken out against the measure, which they say would jeopardize Arizona's economic comeback. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now urged Brewer to veto it, acknowledging that it has been hijacked by politics and irresponsible reporting. The bill's supporters, however, claim that it is necessary to protect religious liberties and prevent lawsuits. As Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year, the governor's decision could have significant consequences, with some threatening to boycott the state if the bill is signed into law.
