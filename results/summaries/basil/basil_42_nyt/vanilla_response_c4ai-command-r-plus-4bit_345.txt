SUMMARY: A bill passed by the Arizona Legislature grants business owners the right to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has faced strong opposition from various groups, including elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups, who have urged Governor Jan Brewer to veto it. Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake have also expressed their hope for a veto, and several companies have threatened to reconsider their investments in Arizona if the bill becomes law. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now called for a veto, acknowledging the harm it has caused to the state's image and economy. Supporters of the bill defend it as protecting religious liberties, while opponents argue it promotes discrimination and is causing economic harm to the state. With Arizona set to host the Super Bowl next year and still recovering economically, there are concerns about the potential impact of the bill. The bill's fate now rests with Governor Brewer, who has until the end of the week to make a decision.
END OF SUMMARY.
