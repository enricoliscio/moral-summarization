SUMMARY: Arizona's Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused unwanted attention and moral debate in the state, with many elected officials, business leaders, and even some of its sponsors speaking out against it. The bill's moral implications have been mischaracterized and hijacked by its opponents, according to its supporters, who argue that it is meant to shield citizens from lawsuits and protect religious liberty. However, critics argue that it gives carte blanche to discriminate and will cause immeasurable harm to Arizona's reputation and economy, including the potential loss of the Super Bowl and business investments. With a deadline looming, Governor Brewer faces a moral dilemma that has divided the state and drawn national scrutiny. The bill's fate remains uncertain as Arizona grapples with the balance between religious liberty and discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
