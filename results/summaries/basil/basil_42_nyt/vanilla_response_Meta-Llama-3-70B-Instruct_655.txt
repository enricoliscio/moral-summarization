SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and opposition from various groups, including elected officials, civic leaders, and business organizations. Arizona's US Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have urged Brewer to veto the bill, as have three Republican state senators who initially supported the legislation. The bill's supporters, however, defend it as a measure to protect religious liberties. The controversy has raised concerns about the potential economic impact on Arizona, which is set to host the Super Bowl next year and is still recovering from a divisive immigration law passed in 2010. Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her office has received over 10,000 calls and emails on the matter.

END OF SUMMARY.
