Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona's legislation and Governor Brewer's response. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about a bill in Arizona that allows business owners to refuse service based on religious beliefs, which has caused a lot of controversy. The bill is heading to Governor Jan Brewer, and there's a lot of pressure on her to veto it. Elected officials, business groups, and even some Republican senators are urging her to reject the measure because it's harming Arizona's image and economy.

Apple and American Airlines have contacted her, worried that the bill could jeopardize business investments. The bill's supporters argue it's about protecting religious freedom, but opponents see it as promoting discrimination. The state is trying to recover economically, hosting the Super Bowl next year, so this bill could affect that. There's also mention of past issues with an immigration law that caused boycotts.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the bill's purpose, the pressure on Brewer, the economic concerns, the supporters' arguments, the impact on Arizona's image, and the potential consequences like Super Bowl relocation.

I should structure it to first introduce the bill, then mention the pressure and opposition, followed by the supporters' stance, and finally the implications for Arizona's economy and image. Make sure to keep it concise and clear, hitting all the key elements without getting too detailed.
