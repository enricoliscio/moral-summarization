SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing mounting pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked widespread criticism, with many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups speaking out against it. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now reversed their stance, citing the harm it could cause to the state's economy and reputation. The bill's supporters, however, claim that it is being mischaracterized and that opponents are using "lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting" to sway public opinion. With the state preparing to host the Super Bowl next year and still recovering from a divisive immigration law passed in 2010, the governor's decision could have significant consequences for Arizona's image and economy.
