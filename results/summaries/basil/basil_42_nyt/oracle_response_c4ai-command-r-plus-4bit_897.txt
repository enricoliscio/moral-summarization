SUMMARY: Arizona's legislature passed a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a moral dilemma for Governor Jan Brewer, who must decide whether to veto the bill or sign it into law. Many individuals and businesses, including Apple Inc. and American Airlines, have publicly opposed the bill, arguing that it would jeopardize the state's economic comeback and cause immeasurable harm by encouraging discrimination. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also urged Governor Brewer to veto it, admitting that it has been mischaracterized and hijacked by opponents through lies and irresponsible reporting. The bill's supporters, such as Cathi Herrod of the Center for Arizona Policy, defend it as necessary to protect religious liberties. With the state set to host the Super Bowl next year and working to regain its economic vitality, the decision has put Governor Brewer in a difficult position. She has received over 10,000 calls and emails on the matter, and her decision will have significant implications for Arizona's future.
END OF SUMMARY.
