SUMMARY: Arizona is facing a moral dilemma as a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others on religious grounds is sent to Governor Jan Brewer's desk for approval. Despite pressure from various corners, including Republican senators and business leaders, the bill has caused unwanted attention and potential economic repercussions for the state. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now called for a veto, acknowledging the harm it is causing to Arizona's reputation and economy. The bill's remaining supporters defend it as necessary for protecting religious liberties, while opponents argue it promotes discrimination and is causing harm to the state. With Arizona set to host the Super Bowl next year and working to recover economically, the bill's passage could lead to boycotts and relocation of businesses. The governor's decision is highly anticipated, and the bill's fate will have significant moral and practical implications for the state. END OF SUMMARY.
