Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Arizona's Legislature passing a bill that allows business owners to refuse service based on religious beliefs, specifically targeting gays and others. Gov. Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto it.

First, I should identify the main points. The bill is controversial, leading to national attention and opposition from various groups. Elected officials, business leaders, and even some Republican senators who supported it are now urging Brewer to veto it. They argue it's causing harm to Arizona's image and economy.

Apple and American Airlines executives contacted Brewer, expressing concerns about the bill's impact. There's also mention of the Super Bowl potentially moving if the bill passes, affecting Arizona's economy. The state is still recovering from the 2010 immigration law's negative effects.

Additionally, Republican candidates opposing the bill are mentioned, with one calling it a license to discriminate. The bill is set to expand religious liberty protections, but opponents see it as promoting intolerance.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the key elements: the bill's content, opposition from various groups, economic concerns, potential impact on events like the Super Bowl, and the political implications.

I'll structure it by first introducing the bill and Brewer's decision, then the opposition, economic repercussions, and the political stance. Make sure to keep it concise and include all critical points without going into too much detail.
