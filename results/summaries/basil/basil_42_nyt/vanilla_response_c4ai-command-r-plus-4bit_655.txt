SUMMARY: Arizona lawmakers passed a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, causing widespread backlash and pressure on Governor Jan Brewer to veto the bill. Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, along with business leaders from Apple Inc. and American Airlines, urged the governor to reject the bill, citing potential economic harm to the state. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill also retracted their support, acknowledging the negative impact on Arizona's image. Opponents of the bill, including Republican candidates vying to succeed Governor Brewer, argued that it promotes discrimination and undermines the state's economic recovery. Meanwhile, supporters of the bill, such as Cathi Herrod from the Center for Arizona Policy, defended it, claiming that opponents were mischaracterizing its true intent. Governor Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, but her spokesman suggested she would make a decision sooner. The bill's passage has attracted unwanted national attention and raised concerns about Arizona's image and potential economic fallout, including the possibility of the NFL moving the Super Bowl to another state.
END OF SUMMARY.
