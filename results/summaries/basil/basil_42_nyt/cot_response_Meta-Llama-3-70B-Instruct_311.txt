SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and criticism from elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups, who argue it would lead to "religious intolerance" and harm the state's economy. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now urged Brewer to veto it, saying it has been "mischaracterized" and is causing the state "immeasurable harm." Supporters of the bill, on the other hand, claim that opponents are using "lies" and "irresponsible reporting" to hijack the discussion. The bill's fate will have significant implications for Arizona's image and economy, particularly as it prepares to host the Super Bowl next year. END OF SUMMARY.
