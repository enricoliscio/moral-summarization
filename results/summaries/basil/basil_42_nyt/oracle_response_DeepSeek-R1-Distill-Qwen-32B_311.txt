Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has already given a summary, but I want to make sure I understand the process. Let me break it down.

First, I read the article about Arizona's bill that allows businesses to refuse service based on religion. The governor, Jan Brewer, is under pressure to veto it. The author uses words like "refuse," "jeopardize," "intolerance," etc., which carry moral connotations.

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these words as possible. I should focus on the key points: the bill's content, the pressure on the governor, the opposition from various groups, and the potential consequences like economic harm and boycotts.

I'll start by mentioning the bill and its purpose. Then, I'll note the pressure from elected officials, business leaders, and the public. Include examples like Apple and American Airlines urging a veto. Highlight the senators who regret the bill's mischaracterization and the harm it's causing.

Also, mention the supporters' defense, the Super Bowl implications, and the impact on Arizona's image from the previous immigration law. Conclude with the candidates' opposition and the governor's undecided stance.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral words are included where appropriate. Let me draft that now.

SUMMARY:  
The Arizona Legislature passed a bill allowing business owners to refuse service to gays and others citing religious beliefs, sparking intense moral and political debate. Gov. Jan Brewer faced pressure to veto the measure, with critics arguing it could jeopardize Arizona's economic comeback and foster religious intolerance. Business leaders, including Apple and American Airlines, warned the bill could harm the state's economy and reputation. Republican senators who supported the bill expressed regret, stating it had been mischaracterized as a tool of intolerance, causing immeasurable harm. Supporters defended the bill, calling opposition "politics at its worst" and accusing critics of spreading lies and hijacking the discussion. The bill's passage drew national attention, with concerns it could lead to boycotts and impact Arizona's image, already scarred by a controversial 2010 immigration law. Republican candidates for governor opposed the measure, with one calling it a license to discriminate. Brewer, under public pressure, had until the end of the week to decide, with her office receiving over 10,000 calls and emails. The bill's fate could influence Arizona's economic future and its ability to host events like the Super Bowl. END OF SUMMARY.
