Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona's bill and Governor Jan Brewer's decision. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article is about a bill that allows business owners to refuse service based on religious beliefs. The bill is facing a lot of opposition. Key points include elected officials, business leaders, and even Arizona's senators urging the governor to veto it. Apple and American Airlines executives contacted her, expressing concerns about the bill harming the state's economy. Some Republican senators who supported the bill are now regretting it, saying it's causing harm. Supporters, like Cathi Herrod, defend it, calling the opposition's arguments lies. The bill is linked to Arizona's image issues from past laws, like the 2010 immigration law, which caused boycotts. The governor has until the end of the week to decide, and she's under a lot of pressure. The article also mentions the upcoming Super Bowl and potential relocation of companies, which could be affected if the bill passes.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the bill's purpose and the opposition. Then mention the economic concerns from businesses and the senators' regret. Include the supporters' stance and the impact on Arizona's image. Finally, note the governor's deadline and the potential consequences if she signs the bill.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is included succinctly.
