SUMMARY: Arizona legislators passed a bill that would allow business owners to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs, causing widespread controversy and pressure on Governor Jan Brewer to veto the bill. The bill has attracted national attention and criticism from various groups, including Republican senators, business leaders, and civic leaders, who argue that it promotes discrimination and could harm the state's economy and image. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also called for a veto, expressing concern about its potential for misuse and the harm it is causing to Arizona. Supporters of the bill, such as Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, defend it as necessary to protect religious liberty and criticize its opponents for mischaracterizing its intent. Governor Brewer faces a deadline to act on the bill, with many urging her to veto it to prevent potential economic fallout and maintain Arizona's progress toward economic recovery. The bill also comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year, with some suggesting that signing the bill could lead to the event being moved out of the state. The controversy reflects a broader debate over balancing religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws in the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
