Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Arizona's governor, Jan Brewer, who's considering a bill that allows businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a lot of backlash. Elected officials, business leaders, and even some Republican senators are urging her to veto it. They argue it's harming Arizona's economy and reputation, especially since the state is trying to host the Super Bowl next year.

The bill's supporters, like Cathi Herrod, say it's about protecting religious freedom and that opponents are mischaracterizing it. The governor is under a lot of pressure, with over 10,000 calls and emails. The moral framing here is about balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination laws. The author presents the conflict between these two values, showing the tension and the potential consequences for Arizona's economy and image.

I need to capture this balance in the summary. I should mention the bill, the pressure on the governor, the economic concerns, the supporters' arguments, and the moral dilemma. Keep it under 200 words and make sure to highlight the moral aspects without taking sides.
