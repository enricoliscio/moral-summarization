SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national attention and opposition from elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups, who argue it would harm the state's economy and reputation. Even some Republican state senators who initially supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing the harm it would cause to the state. The bill's supporters claim it is about protecting religious liberties, but opponents see it as a license to discriminate. With the state preparing to host the Super Bowl next year, there are concerns that the bill could lead to boycotts and harm to the state's economy. Governor Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision will have significant implications for Arizona's reputation and economy.
