SUMMARY: 
Arizona is once again in the national spotlight as Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would grant businesses the right to deny service to gays and others on religious grounds. The bill has caused controversy, with many elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups speaking out against it, including Apple Inc. and American Airlines executives. Three Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have also retracted their support, acknowledging the harm it is causing to the state's economy and image. The bill's remaining supporters defend it as a shield for religious liberties, while opponents criticize it as a sword of intolerance. The controversy comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl and struggles to recover economically. There are concerns that the bill, if signed into law, could lead to boycotts and discourage companies from relocating to Arizona. The governor's spokesman, Andrew Wilder, indicated that she will act on the bill soon, but her decision remains unknown. The bill's moral implications and potential economic consequences have created a challenging situation for the state, highlighting the delicate balance between religious freedom and discrimination.
