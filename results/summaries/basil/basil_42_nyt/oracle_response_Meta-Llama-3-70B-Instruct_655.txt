SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national attention, has been criticized by elected officials, civic leaders, and business groups, who argue it would jeopardize the state's economic comeback and cause harm to its image. Republican state senators who initially supported the bill have now urged Brewer to veto it, citing its mischaracterization as a "sword of religious intolerance." The bill's supporters, however, claim that opponents have hijacked the discussion with lies and irresponsible reporting. The governor's decision is crucial, as the state prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality. If signed into law, the bill could lead to boycotts and harm to the state's economy. Brewer has until the end of the week to act on the bill, and her decision will have significant consequences for Arizona's future.
