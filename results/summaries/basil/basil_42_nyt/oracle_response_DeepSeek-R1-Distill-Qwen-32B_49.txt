Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Arizona's legislation allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, and the governor's response. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The bill passed both houses, and the governor is under pressure to veto it. Business leaders and politicians are against it, fearing it could jeopardize Arizona's economic comeback. Companies like Apple and American Airlines are concerned about the impact on their investments. The senators who supported the bill are now regretting it, saying it's causing harm. Supporters argue it's about religious liberty, but opponents see it as promoting intolerance. The governor is considering her options, with many urging her to veto the bill.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like refuse, comeback, signed, jeopardize, accomplished, mischaracterized, intolerance, causing, harm, politics, hijacked, lies, reporting, passed, stop, boycotts, exercise, protect, denying, gives, discriminate, bring, forge.

I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the moral debate around the bill.

I'll start by mentioning the bill and its purpose. Then, note the opposition from business leaders and politicians, using words like jeopardize, comeback, accomplish. Highlight the senators' regret and the harm caused. Mention the supporters' arguments versus the opponents' views on politics and lies. Conclude with the governor's consideration and the potential impact on Arizona's image and economy.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I'll use the morally framed words where appropriate to maintain the author's original framing.
