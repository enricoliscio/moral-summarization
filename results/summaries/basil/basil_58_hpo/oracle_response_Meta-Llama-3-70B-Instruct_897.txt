SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his bid for the 2016 presidential election, declaring "I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity, which he claims is causing anxiety among Americans. He emphasized the need for compromise, stating that "both parties have failed our country" and that it's time to "have the courage to stand up and say 'enough'." Christie's reputation as a tough-talking leader was reinforced by his handling of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, during which he demonstrated "responsiveness" and "leadership." However, his image suffered a blow in 2014 with the "Bridgegate" scandal, which revealed a plot by his administration to cause traffic jams as retaliation against a mayor. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite these controversies, Christie remains a contender in the GOP presidential race. END OF SUMMARY.
