Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used. The author used words like "fight," "failed," "led," "responsiveness," "leadership," "lead," "plot," and "bridgegate." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Christie is a Republican governor of New Jersey and he's running for president. He made his announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School. He criticized Congress and President Obama, saying both parties have failed the country. He emphasized the need for compromise and courage. He's known for being tough and had some controversies, like the Bridgegate scandal. He was a good leader during Hurricane Sandy, which boosted his popularity. He's also been involved in the Republican Governors Association and has changed his stance on Common Core.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary that's no more than 200 words. I'll start by mentioning his announcement, his criticism of Congress and Obama, and his emphasis on compromise and leadership. I should include the morally framed words here, like "fight," "failed," "led," "leadership." Then, I'll touch on his reputation, mentioning "plot" and "bridgegate" as part of his controversies. I should also note his leadership during Sandy and his changing stance on Common Core, using "responsiveness" and "leadership" again. Finally, I'll mention his standing in the polls among GOP candidates.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. I'll structure it in a way that each sentence covers a main point, using the moral terms appropriately. I'll avoid adding any extra information not in the original article and ensure that the summary accurately reflects Christie's actions and the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary now, keeping it concise and making sure all the moral words are included. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that the summary captures the essence of the article with the required moral framing.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States." He criticized Congress and President Obama, claiming both parties have "failed our country" and prioritized partisanship over compromise. Christie, known for his blunt style and leadership during Hurricane Sandy, emphasized the need for courage and compromise. However, his reputation was tarnished by the "Bridgegate" scandal, where his administration plotted to cause traffic jams as retaliation. Despite his initial support for Common Core, Christie reversed his stance, citing its negative impact. His favorability rose post-Sandy but declined amid controversies. Christie, a former Republican Governors Association chairman, is now in the middle of the GOP presidential race. END OF SUMMARY.
