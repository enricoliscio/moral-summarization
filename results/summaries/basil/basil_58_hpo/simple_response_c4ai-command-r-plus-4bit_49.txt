SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, known for his tough-talking and blunt speaking style, has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Christie, a Republican, has served as New Jersey governor since 2010 and is well-known for his political bullying and brash demeanor. His reputation was tarnished by the "Bridgegate" scandal in 2014, where members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie has also been praised for his visible leadership during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and his work as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. In his announcement speech, Christie criticized both political parties for their failure to compromise and pledged to fight for the people of the United States. He also took aim at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity. Christie's entry into the crowded GOP field adds another contender with a reputation for straight talk, but his ability to appeal to a broad range of voters remains uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
