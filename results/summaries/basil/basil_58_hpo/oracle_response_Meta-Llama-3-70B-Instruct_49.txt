SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his 2016 presidential bid, vowing to "fight" for the American people. In his announcement, Christie criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity, which he believes has led to anxiety among Americans. He emphasized the need for courage and compromise, saying "both parties have failed our country" and that "compromise is somehow a dirty word." Christie's reputation as a tough-talking former federal prosecutor has been marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal, in which his administration was involved in a plot to cause traffic jams. Despite this, Christie has led New Jersey through catastrophic damage from Hurricane Sandy, showcasing his responsiveness and leadership. He has also worked to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S. Christie's blunt speaking style has earned him criticism, but he remains committed to leading, rather than seeking popularity.
