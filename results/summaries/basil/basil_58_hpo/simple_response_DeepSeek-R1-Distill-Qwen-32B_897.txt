Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, I should first read through the article to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by stating that Chris Christie is running for president. He made the announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School. He criticized Congress and President Obama, saying both parties have failed the country and that compromise is seen as a dirty word. He emphasizes the need for courage to make tough choices. 

I should note that he's a tough-talking former federal prosecutor with a reputation for political bullying, especially from the George Washington Bridge scandal. He's been governor since 2010, won twice despite more Democrats, and handled Hurricane Sandy well, which boosted his approval. He turned down Romney's invitation to campaign during the storm, focusing on his state instead. He praised Obama's leadership during Sandy, which is interesting because it shows he can acknowledge the other party's strengths.

He was chairman of the Republican Governors Association, helped other governors, and prepared for the presidency by studying foreign policy. His brash style sometimes makes him confrontational. The Bridgegate scandal hurt his image, and he's also criticized for changing his stance on Common Core.

The summary needs to capture his announcement, his criticisms, his background, the scandals, and his political shifts. I should make sure to include the moral elements, like his emphasis on compromise and courage, as well as the scandals that affected his reputation.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the announcement, mention his criticisms, his background and achievements, the scandals, and his recent political shifts. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like his stance on compromise and the consequences of his actions.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point but ensure all key aspects are covered succinctly. Also, the tone should reflect the original article's moral perspective, which seems to present Christie as a leader with strong opinions but also flaws like the scandals and flip-flopping.

Alright, putting it all together, making sure it's concise and hits all the main points while preserving the moral elements.
