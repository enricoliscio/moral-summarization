SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. In his announcement, Christie emphasized the need for courage and compromise in Washington, criticizing both parties for their lack of productivity and creating anxiety among Americans. Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, has a reputation for being a tough-talking former federal prosecutor. Despite being a Republican in a predominantly Democratic state, Christie has won election twice and led the state through the devastating Hurricane Sandy in 2012. However, his image was tarnished by the "Bridgegate" scandal in 2014, which involved his administration's role in causing traffic jams as political retaliation. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite these controversies, Christie remains a prominent figure in the GOP presidential field.
