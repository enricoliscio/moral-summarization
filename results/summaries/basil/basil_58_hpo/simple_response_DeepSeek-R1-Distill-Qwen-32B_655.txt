Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the key points that highlight his strengths and the criticisms he's faced.

First, I'll note that he's a Republican governor of New Jersey and has a reputation for being tough. His announcement included criticizing Washington for its lack of productivity. I should mention his background, like leading during Hurricane Sandy, which boosted his popularity. But I also need to include the negative aspects, like the Bridgegate scandal and his flip-flopping on Common Core.

I should structure the summary to first introduce his announcement, then his background, his criticisms, and finally the challenges he's faced. Keeping it under 200 words, I need to be concise but include all these elements. I'll make sure to highlight both his strengths and weaknesses to maintain the moral framing as presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. In his public announcement, Christie criticized Washington's lack of productivity and bipartisan gridlock, calling for compromise and courage to address the nation's challenges. He highlighted his experience leading New Jersey, particularly during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which boosted his popularity. Christie has a reputation for a tough, confrontational style, though his image was tarnished by the "Bridgegate" scandal in 2014, where his administration was accused of retaliating against a local mayor. Despite his initial support for Common Core education standards, Christie recently reversed his stance, citing concerns about their implementation. Known for his blunt communication, Christie faces both admiration and criticism as he enters the crowded GOP field. END OF SUMMARY.
