SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, declaring he's "ready to fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity, claiming it's causing Americans anxiety. He argued that both parties have "failed our country" and that compromise has become a "dirty word." Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, has a reputation for political bullying, which was reinforced by the "Bridgegate" scandal. Despite this, Christie's favorability rating skyrocketed after he led the state through Hurricane Sandy's catastrophic damage, showcasing his "responsiveness" and "leadership." Christie has since worked to raise his profile, including holding prep sessions on foreign policy. However, his image suffered when members of his administration were involved in a "plot" to cause traffic jams. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. END OF SUMMARY.
