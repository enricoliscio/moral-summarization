SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity, claiming it has led to anxiety among Americans. He emphasized the need for compromise, stating that "both parties have failed our country" and that "compromise is somehow a dirty word." Christie's reputation as a tough-talking former federal prosecutor was reinforced by the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, dubbed "Bridgegate," which involved a plot by his administration to cause traffic jams. Despite this, Christie's favorability rating skyrocketed after he demonstrated responsiveness and leadership during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. With his blunt speaking style, Christie acknowledged that he can come off as brash and confrontational, but emphasized that his job is to lead. END OF SUMMARY.
