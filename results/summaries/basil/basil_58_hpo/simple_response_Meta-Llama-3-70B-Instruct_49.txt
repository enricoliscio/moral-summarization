SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his bid for the 2016 presidential election, touting his leadership skills and criticizing the lack of productivity in Congress. Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, took hits at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, and called for compromise and courage in politics. Despite his tough-talking reputation, Christie has a history of working across party lines, as seen in his response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. However, his image was marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal in 2014, which involved his administration's role in causing traffic jams as political retribution. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite these setbacks, Christie remains a strong contender in the GOP presidential field, with a favorability rating that has held steady.
