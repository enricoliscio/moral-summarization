SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential bid for 2016, calling for "courage" to stand up and say "enough" to the lack of productivity in Congress, which he claims has led to "anxiety" among Americans. Christie, known for his "blunt" speaking style, criticized both parties for failing the country, saying that "compromise" has become a "dirty" word. He touted his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, praising President Obama's "responsiveness" and "leadership" in the storm's aftermath. Christie's reputation for "bullying" was reinforced by the "Bridgegate" scandal, which caused his favorability ratings to plummet. Despite this, Christie remains a contender, promising to "lead" the country with "courage" and "compromise". END OF SUMMARY.
