Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used, which are: fight, failed, led, responsiveness, leadership, lead, plot, bridgegate. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Christie announced his candidacy, criticized Congress and Obama, talked about his background, including the George Washington Bridge scandal, and his leadership during Hurricane Sandy.

I should start by stating he's running for president and mention his public announcement. Then, include his criticism of Congress and both parties failing, using "failed" and "led." I'll note his emphasis on compromise and courage, using "fight" and "lead." 

Next, I need to mention his background as a governor, the Bridgegate scandal, and how it affected his image, using "plot" and "bridgegate." Also, his leadership during Sandy, highlighting "responsiveness" and "leadership." 

Finally, his recent reversal on Common Core and his standing in the polls. I'll make sure to keep the summary under 200 words and include all the moral words as much as possible without making it too forced.

Let me structure it: announcement, criticism, background, leadership, scandal, reversal, and current standing. That should cover all points and include the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
Chris Christie, New Jersey's governor, announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States." He criticized Congress and President Obama, claiming both parties have "failed" the country and made compromise seem like a "dirty word." Christie emphasized the need for courage to address the nation's challenges. His announcement came after a career marked by controversy, including the "Bridgegate" scandal, where his administration was accused of causing traffic jams as retaliation. Despite this, Christie's "leadership" during Hurricane Sandy boosted his image. He initially focused on state recovery over politics, praising Obama's "responsiveness" during the disaster. Christie, known for his blunt style, has also faced criticism for reversing his stance on Common Core. His campaign highlights a mix of "fighting" for change and grappling with past controversies. END OF SUMMARY.
