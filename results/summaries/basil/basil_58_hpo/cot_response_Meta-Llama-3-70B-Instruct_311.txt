SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for a lack of productivity, which he claims is causing Americans anxiety. He emphasized the need for courage to stand up and say "enough" to the gridlock in Congress, where both parties have "failed our country." Christie's reputation for political bullying was reinforced by the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, dubbed "Bridgegate." Despite this, Christie's favorability rating skyrocketed after he led the state through Hurricane Sandy's catastrophic damage in 2012, showcasing his leadership and responsiveness. Christie has been working to ready himself for a White House run, but his image suffered a blow due to the scandal and his reversal on Common Core education standards. END OF SUMMARY.
