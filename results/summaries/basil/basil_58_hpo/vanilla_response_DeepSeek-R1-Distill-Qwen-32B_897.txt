Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. They provided the article, and they have specific instructions on how to format the summary. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It mentions that Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, announced his presidential bid in 2016. He made this announcement both via a phone call and a public speech at his alma mater. In his speech, he criticized Congress and President Obama for their lack of productivity, emphasizing the need for compromise and courage. 

The article also gives some background on Christie. He's a tough-talking former prosecutor with a reputation for political bullying, notably due to the George Washington Bridge scandal. Despite this, he was popular after leading the state through Hurricane Sandy in 2012. He chose to focus on recovery efforts over politics at that time.

Additionally, Christie was the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, helping other Republicans in the 2014 midterms. However, his popularity took a hit due to the Bridgegate scandal, and he's faced criticism for changing his stance on Common Core.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should focus on the main events and his political background, including his strengths and controversies.

I'll start by mentioning his announcement, his criticism of Congress, and his background as governor. Then, touch on his leadership during Sandy, his role in the RGA, and the controversies like Bridgegate and Common Core. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft that and check the word count. I think that covers all the essential points without going into too much detail. I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key aspects of the article.
