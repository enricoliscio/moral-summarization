SUMMARY: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, joining a crowded field of Republican contenders. In his announcement speech, Christie emphasized his experience as governor and his ability to lead, taking aim at Washington lawmakers for their inaction and blaming both parties for the country's problems. Christie has a reputation for his blunt speaking style and political bullying, which was highlighted by the "Bridgegate" scandal. He served as governor during Hurricane Sandy, receiving praise for his visible leadership during the disaster. Christie has also faced criticism for his reversal on Common Core education standards and has seen his popularity decline due to the scandal. He is currently in the middle of the pack among GOP candidates. Christie's campaign will focus on his executive experience and no-nonsense attitude, positioning himself as a strong leader who can get things done.
