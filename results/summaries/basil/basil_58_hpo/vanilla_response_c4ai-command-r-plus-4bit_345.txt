SUMMARY: Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 US presidential election. In his announcement speech, he criticized lawmakers in Washington for their lack of productivity and called for compromise.

He faced challenges such as the "Bridgegate" scandal and criticism for his brash speaking style and shifting positions on issues like Common Core.
