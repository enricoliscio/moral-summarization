SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, touting his tough-talking, blunt speaking style and record as a federal prosecutor. Christie's reputation, however, has been marred by a bullying scandal and a recent reversal of his position on Common Core education standards. During his announcement, Christie criticized both political parties for failing the country and promoting a culture where compromise is seen as a dirty word. He praised his home state and his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, while also taking aim at lawmakers in Washington, including President Obama, for their lack of productivity. Christie's favorability ratings took a hit after the "Bridgegate" scandal, where members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie has served as governor of a predominantly Democratic state since 2010 and was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2013. He has worked to raise money and support for Republican governors, many of whom won in the 2014 midterms. Christie's moral framing centers around his courage to stand up and fight for what he believes, even if it comes across as brash or confrontational.
