SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2016 US presidential election. Christie, known for his tough-talking and blunt speaking style, has praised his home state and criticized Washington lawmakers for their lack of productivity, which he believes is causing anxiety among Americans. The governor has also been involved in controversies, such as the "Bridgegate" scandal, where members of his administration were found to have caused traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie has enjoyed high favorability ratings and is known for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy. He has also been praised for his responsiveness and "leadership" in the storm's aftermath, even receiving praise from President Barack Obama. Christie's speaking style has been described as brash and confrontational, and he has been accused of political bullying. However, he defends his style, saying he is not in the business of getting elected as prom king but leading. It remains to be seen how Christie's moral stance and reputation will impact his presidential campaign.
