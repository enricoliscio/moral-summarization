SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, declaring that he is "ready to fight for the people of the United States of America." In his announcement, Christie criticized both political parties for their failure to compromise and their lack of productivity, which he believes is causing anxiety for Americans. Christie's reputation as a tough-talking, blunt, and sometimes brash leader was highlighted, with a mention of the "Bridgegate" scandal that damaged his image. Christie praised his home state and his own leadership during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, noting that he put the needs of his state above presidential politics at the time. He has also served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and worked to raise money and support for Republican governors across the country. Christie's favorability ratings have fluctuated, with "Bridgegate" causing a sharp rise in his negatives, but he remains a prominent figure in the crowded GOP field. Christie is ready to lead the fight for America, claiming that "both parties have failed our country."
