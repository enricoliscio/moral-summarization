SUMMARY: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, taking aim at Washington lawmakers for their lack of productivity. Christie, known for his blunt speech and political bullying, served as governor during Hurricane Sandy and gained popularity for his visible presence during the disaster. He faced criticism for his involvement in the "Bridgegate" scandal and his reversal on Common Core education standards. Christie has positioned himself as a leader unafraid of confrontation and has worked to raise his national profile through the Republican Governors Association. His announcement speech emphasized his willingness to fight for the American people and his belief in the importance of compromise. Christie's favorability ratings have fluctuated, and he currently sits in the middle of the pack of GOP candidates.
END OF SUMMARY.
