Alright, I need to summarize this article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Chris Christie is the New Jersey governor and a Republican. He announced his presidential bid in 2016, making the announcement both via a phone call and a public event at his alma mater. In his speech, he criticized Congress and President Obama for lack of productivity, calling compromise a necessary virtue that's been disrespected. He also mentioned his experience leading New Jersey through Hurricane Sandy, which boosted his popularity. 

He's known for a tough, blunt style and had some controversies, like the Bridgegate scandal where his administration caused traffic jams as retaliation. His support for Common Core initially was positive but later reversed. He's in the middle of the pack in polls among GOP candidates.

I should structure the summary to include his announcement, his criticisms, his leadership during Sandy, his political style, controversies, and his current standing. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.
