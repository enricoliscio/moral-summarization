SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his bid for the 2016 presidential election. In his announcement speech, Christie emphasized the need for compromise and criticized lawmakers in Washington for their lack of productivity, which he believes is causing anxiety among Americans. Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, has a reputation for being a tough and effective leader, having led New Jersey through the devastating Hurricane Sandy in 2012. However, his image was tarnished by the "Bridgegate" scandal in 2014, which involved his administration's role in causing traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie remains a strong candidate, having served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and having a proven track record of leadership. Christie's moral framing emphasizes the importance of courage, compromise, and leadership, urging Americans to stand up and demand change from their politicians.
