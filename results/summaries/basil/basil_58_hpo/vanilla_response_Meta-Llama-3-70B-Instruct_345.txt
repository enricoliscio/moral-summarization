SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Christie made the announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School, saying he's "ready to fight for the people of the United States of America." He praised his home state and criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for a lack of productivity and compromise. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has served as governor since 2010 and led the state through Hurricane Sandy in 2012. His favorability ratings soared after the disaster, but were later damaged by the "Bridgegate" scandal. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite this, he remains a middle-of-the-pack GOP presidential candidate.
