SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, touting his leadership experience and blaming Washington lawmakers, including President Obama, for their failure to compromise and get things done. Christie, known for his blunt speaking style and tough-talking demeanor, has faced criticism for his involvement in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal and for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. He has also been accused of political bullying and having a brash and confrontational attitude. However, Christie's response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, where he put his state first, skyrocketed his favorability ratings. During his announcement speech, Christie emphasized the need for courage and standing up against the failures of both political parties. He also highlighted his experience as governor and chairman of the Republican Governors Association, showcasing his ability to lead and work towards a common goal. Despite facing some challenges, Christie remains a formidable contender among the GOP presidential candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
