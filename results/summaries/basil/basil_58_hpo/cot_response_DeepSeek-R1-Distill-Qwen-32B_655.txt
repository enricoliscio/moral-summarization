Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral framings. 

Starting with the article, it talks about Christie's announcement, his background, and some controversies. I should look for words that carry moral implications. Words like "fight," "inspired," "failed," "anxiety," "compromise," "courage," "stand up," "enough," "tough-talking," "political bullying," "scandal," "failed," "reputation," "catastrophic," "visible," "leadership," "prom king," "lead," "controversy," "negatives," "reversed," "criticism." These all seem to have moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with Christie announcing his candidacy, mention his tough-talking style, his criticism of Congress, the Bridgegate scandal, his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, his reversal on Common Core, and his standing in the polls. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to convey the tone and issues highlighted in the article.
