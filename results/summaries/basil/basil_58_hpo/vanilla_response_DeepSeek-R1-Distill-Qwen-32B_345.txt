Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, announced his presidential run. He told his supporters via a phone call and then made a public announcement at his alma mater. In his speech, he criticized Congress and President Obama, saying both parties have failed and that compromise is seen as a bad thing. He emphasized the need for courage to make changes.

Then, it goes into his background: he's a former federal prosecutor, known for a tough style, and has been governor since 2010. He's a Republican in a state where Democrats are more numerous. He led New Jersey through Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which boosted his popularity. He focused on state matters over the presidential election at that time, even declining an invitation to campaign with Romney.

He became chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2013, helping other Republicans, and prepared for a potential presidency by discussing foreign policy with experts. He's known for being blunt, which some find off-putting, but he doesn't care as long as he's leading.

However, his reputation took a hit in 2014 due to the Bridgegate scandal, where his administration caused traffic jams as retaliation. His support for Common Core also wavered, leading to criticism. Despite all this, he's in the middle of the pack in polls for GOP candidates.

So, the key points are: Christie announces his presidential bid, his criticism of Washington, his leadership during Sandy, his political background, the Bridgegate scandal, his flip-flop on Common Core, and his standing in polls.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include his announcement, his criticisms, his leadership, his background, the scandals, and his current standing.

I should structure it logically: start with the announcement, then his criticisms, background, scandals, and current status. Make sure it's concise and hits all main points without getting too detailed.
