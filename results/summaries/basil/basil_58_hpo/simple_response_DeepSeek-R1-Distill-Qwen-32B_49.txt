Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

Okay, the article starts by stating that Christie announced his candidacy. He made a public announcement at his alma mater, where he criticized Congress and both parties for failing to compromise. He mentioned that compromise isn't a dirty word and that they need to have the courage to choose. That's a strong moral statement about leadership and partisanship.

Then, it goes into his background: he's a former federal prosecutor, known for a tough style, and his reputation took a hit during the Bridgegate scandal. He's been governor since 2010, winning twice despite being in a state with more Democrats. He handled Hurricane Sandy well, which boosted his popularity. He turned down a Romney event to focus on recovery, even praising Obama for leadership.

He became chairman of the Republican Governors Association, helping other governors, and prepared for a White House run. He's blunt and confrontational, acknowledging that not everyone likes him. His support for Common Core changed, which drew criticism.

The summary needs to include his announcement, his criticism of Washington, his leadership during Sandy, the Bridgegate scandal, his blunt style, and his shifting stance on Common Core. I need to make sure the moral framing is clear, like his emphasis on compromise and leadership.

I should structure the summary to highlight his strengths and the controversies, keeping it under 200 words. Let me make sure to include all key points without going over the word limit.
