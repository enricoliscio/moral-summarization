SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, vowing to fight for the people of the United States. Christie's announcement comes after serving as governor since 2010 and leading the state through the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for which he received praise for his responsiveness and leadership. However, Christie's reputation has also been marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal, in which members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Christie criticized both political parties for failing the country and emphasized the need for courage and compromise. He highlighted his own leadership style, acknowledging his brash and confrontational manner but asserting that his focus is on leading rather than being liked. Christie's favorability ratings have fluctuated, and he currently stands in the middle of the pack among GOP presidential candidates. Christie's announcement sets the stage for a competitive race, as he joins a crowded field of Republican contenders seeking the presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
