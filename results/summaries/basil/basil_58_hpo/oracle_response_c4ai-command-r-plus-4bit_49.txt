SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2016 presidential race, announcing his candidacy and promising to fight for the people of the United States. Christie, known for his tough-talking and blunt speaking style, has framed his campaign around the idea of courage and leadership in the face of failure. He has criticized both political parties for their lack of productivity and compromise, claiming that they have failed the country and caused anxiety among Americans. Christie highlighted his own leadership experience as governor, particularly his response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which brought him praise for his responsiveness and visibility during the disaster. However, Christie's reputation has also been marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal, where members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie remains confident in his ability to lead, stating that while he may not be everyone's cup of tea, his job is to lead and that's what he strives to do. With his announcement, Christie joins a crowded field of GOP presidential candidates, where he is currently in the middle of the pack in terms of popularity.
END OF SUMMARY.
