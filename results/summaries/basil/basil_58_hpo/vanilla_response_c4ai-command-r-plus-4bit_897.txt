SUMMARY: Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, touting his leadership in the state and criticizing Washington lawmakers for their inaction. Christie, known for his blunt speech and political bullying, has served as governor since 2010, winning reelection in a Democratic-leaning state. He gained prominence during Hurricane Sandy, opting to focus on his state rather than the 2012 presidential election. Christie's reputation took a hit in 2014 due to the "Bridgegate" scandal and his reversal on Common Core. He currently sits in the middle of the pack of GOP candidates. Christie promises to fight for the American people and calls for courage and compromise in the face of political division.
END OF SUMMARY.
