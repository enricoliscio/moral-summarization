Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

Chris Christie is the New Jersey governor and a Republican. He announced his presidential bid, criticizing Washington lawmakers, including Obama, for lack of productivity. He emphasized compromise and courage, which are moral concepts. He's a tough-talker, known for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, which boosted his popularity. However, he faced a scandal called Bridgegate, where his administration caused traffic jams as retaliation, damaging his image. He also changed his stance on Common Core, which critics see as inconsistent.

The morally framed words to include are: fight, failed, led, responsiveness, leadership, lead, plot, bridgegate. I need to make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by introducing Christie announcing his run, mention his criticism of Washington, use 'failed' and 'led' there. Then, talk about his reputation as a tough leader, using 'leadership' and'responsiveness' from his hurricane response. Then, mention the Bridgegate scandal with 'plot' and 'bridgegate'. Finally, note his reversal on Common Core.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each moral word is appropriately placed.
