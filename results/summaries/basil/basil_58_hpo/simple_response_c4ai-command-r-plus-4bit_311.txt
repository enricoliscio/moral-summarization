SUMMARY: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, known for his blunt speaking style and tough-talking manner, has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Christie, a Republican, has served as New Jersey governor since 2010 and is well-known for his political bullying, which was highlighted in the "Bridgegate" scandal. Despite this, Christie has also shown a commitment to his state, notably during Hurricane Sandy, and has worked to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the US. He has praised his home state and criticized lawmakers in Washington for their lack of productivity, which he believes is causing anxiety among Americans. Christie acknowledges his brash and confrontational style but justifies it as necessary for leadership. His announcement comes after he previously downplayed his interest in presidential politics following Hurricane Sandy. Christie's reputation and favorability ratings have been damaged by scandals and his reversal of position on Common Core education standards. He currently sits in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
