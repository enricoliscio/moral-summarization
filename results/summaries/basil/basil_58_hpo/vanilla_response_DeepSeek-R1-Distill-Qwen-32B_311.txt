Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. 

The article mentions that Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, announced his candidacy on Tuesday. He made a public announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School. In his speech, he criticized Washington lawmakers, including President Obama, for the lack of productivity and the aversion to compromise. 

I should note that Christie has a tough-talking style and a history of political controversies, like the Bridgegate scandal. His support for Common Core education standards is another point, as he initially supported them but later reversed his position.

Also, it's important to mention his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, which boosted his favorability. He was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association and prepared for a presidential run by working on foreign policy with experts.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these key elements without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to cover his announcement, his criticisms, his political background, his leadership, and his current standing in the polls. 

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all necessary points.
