SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2016 presidential race, touting his tough-talking, no-nonsense attitude as an asset in a broken political system. Christie, a Republican, has built a reputation as a blunt speaker and a political bully, unafraid to take on both parties and compromise for the betterment of his state. However, his image has been tarnished by the "Bridgegate" scandal, where members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Christie has also been criticized for his recent reversal of his position on Common Core education standards. Despite this, Christie enjoys relatively high favorability ratings, and his leadership during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 brought him into the national spotlight. He has served as governor since 2010 and was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2013, working to raise money and support for Republican governors across the country. Christie's announcement focused on his criticism of Washington lawmakers and his belief that both parties have failed the country. He presents himself as a courageous leader who is willing to stand up and fight for the American people, unafraid to compromise for the greater good. Christie's entry into the already crowded GOP field adds another contender with a strong reputation and a willingness to take on the establishment. END OF SUMMARY.
