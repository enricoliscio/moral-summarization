SUMMARY:
Chris Christie, the tough-talking governor of New Jersey known for his blunt speaking style and political bullying, has announced his candidacy for the 2016 US presidential election. Christie, a Republican, made his announcement at his alma mater, praising his home state and condemning Washington lawmakers for their failures. He highlighted the need for courage and compromise, stating that both parties have let the country down and caused anxiety among Americans. Christie's reputation suffered a blow in the "Bridgegate" scandal, where his administration was involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. He has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite this, Christie has enjoyed high favorability ratings in the past and is known for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy. He is currently in the middle of the pack among GOP presidential candidates. Christie's visibility and straight-talking style have made him a notable contender in the race for the White House.
