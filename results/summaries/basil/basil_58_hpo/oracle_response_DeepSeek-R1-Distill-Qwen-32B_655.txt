Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. He's the New Jersey governor and has a history of both achievements and controversies. The user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: fight, failed, led, responsiveness, leadership, lead, plot, bridgegate.

First, I'll note the key points. Christie announces his candidacy, criticizes Congress, mentions Bridgegate, his leadership during Sandy, and his change on Common Core.

I need to make sure to include those moral terms. For example, when he says he's fighting for the people, that's a moral stance. His criticism of Congress failing the country uses "failed." His leadership during Sandy highlights "leadership" and "responsiveness."

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his announcement, his criticisms, his background, the controversies, and his current standing.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me outline the main sections: announcement, criticism of Congress, background (Sandy, Bridgegate), leadership qualities, and current status.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral words naturally. I'll check each sentence to see if it includes any of the terms and adjust as needed.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is concise and captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral framing as per the user's request.

SUMMARY:  
Chris Christie, New Jersey's Republican governor, has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States." He criticized Congress and President Obama, claiming both parties have "failed" the country and abandoned compromise. Christie, known for his blunt style, gained prominence during Hurricane Sandy, where his "leadership" and "responsiveness" boosted his favorability. However, his reputation suffered in 2014 due to the "Bridgegate" scandal, where his administration plotted to cause traffic jams as retaliation. Despite his tough approach, Christie has shown a willingness to change positions, such as reversing his support for Common Core. His campaign emphasizes courage to "stand up" against Washington's dysfunction, but his morally charged rhetoric is tempered by past controversies. Christie remains in the middle of the GOP field.  
END OF SUMMARY.
