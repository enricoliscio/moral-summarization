SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, promising to "fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie, known for his tough-talking style, criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for a lack of productivity, leading to American anxiety. He emphasized the need for "courage to choose" and "courage to stand up" for what is right, rather than accepting the status quo. Christie's reputation was previously marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal, where his administration was involved in a plot to cause traffic jams. Despite this, Christie has led New Jersey through catastrophic events, such as Hurricane Sandy, showcasing his "leadership" and "responsiveness." Christie's favorability ratings have been affected by his blunt and sometimes brash demeanor, but he remains committed to "lead" and make tough decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
