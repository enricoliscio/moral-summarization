SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, known for his tough-talking and blunt speaking style, has announced his candidacy for the 2016 US presidential election. In a public announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School, Christie positioned himself as a leader who is ready to fight for the people of the United States and to bridge the partisan divide that has led to a lack of productivity and anxiety among Americans. Christie highlighted his experience as governor, notably his response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which brought him praise for his visibility and accessibility during the disaster. However, Christie's reputation has also been marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal, in which members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Christie acknowledged his brash and confrontational style but defended it as a necessary part of leadership. He also criticized both political parties for their failure to compromise and pledged to bring courage and productivity back to Washington. Christie faces challenges, including his middling position in the polls and recent reversals on issues like Common Core education standards. Nonetheless, his announcement adds another prominent figure to the already crowded Republican field. END OF SUMMARY.
