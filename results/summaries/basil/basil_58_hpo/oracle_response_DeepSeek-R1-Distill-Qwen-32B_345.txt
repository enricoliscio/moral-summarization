SUMMARY:  
Chris Christie, New Jersey's Republican governor, has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States." He criticized both parties for failing the country, emphasizing the need for compromise and leadership. Christie, known for his blunt style and reputation as a tough leader, gained prominence during Hurricane Sandy, where his responsiveness and leadership earned him high favorability. However, his image suffered due to the "Bridgegate" scandal, involving a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie has positioned himself as a leader capable of standing up to Washington's dysfunction. His recent reversal on Common Core education standards has also drawn criticism. Christie, who served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is now among the middle tier of GOP presidential candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
