Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

He's a tough-talker, had the Bridgegate scandal, and his support for Common Core changed. His leadership during Sandy boosted his popularity.

I should highlight his tough stance against Washington, the criticism of both parties, and his leadership qualities. Also, mention the scandals and policy shifts as they show his challenges. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the moral elements like his criticism of Washington and his leadership during crises.

Now, I'll structure the summary: start with his announcement, his criticism, mention his background, the scandals, and his current standing. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.
