SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his bid for the 2016 presidential election. In a phone call to supporters and a public announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School, Christie emphasized his desire to "fight for the people of the United States of America." He praised his home state and criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for a lack of productivity and compromise. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has served as governor since 2010 and led the state through Hurricane Sandy's devastation. His favorability ratings soared after the storm, but were later damaged by the "Bridgegate" scandal and criticism for reversing his stance on Common Core education standards. Despite this, Christie remains a contender in the GOP presidential field, known for his blunt speaking style and reputation for political bullying.
