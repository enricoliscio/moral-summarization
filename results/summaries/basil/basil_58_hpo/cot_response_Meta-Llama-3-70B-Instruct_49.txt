SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his 2016 presidential bid, promising to "fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie, known for his tough-talking style, criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity, which he believes is causing Americans anxiety. He emphasized the need for "courage" to choose and stand up, and lamented that "compromise" has become a "dirty word." Christie's reputation for "bullying" was reinforced by the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, but he has also shown "leadership" and "responsiveness" during Hurricane Sandy. Despite controversies, Christie remains a prominent figure in the GOP presidential field, promising to "lead" and take a stand. END OF SUMMARY.
