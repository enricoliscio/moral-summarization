Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Chris Christie announcing his run for president in 2016. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should follow the specified format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. Christie announces his candidacy, his background as New Jersey governor, his tough stance on Washington, his reputation from the Bridgegate scandal, his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, and his recent shift on Common Core.

I should structure the summary to include his announcement, his criticism of Congress, his experience as governor, the Bridgegate incident, his handling of Sandy, his political maneuvering, and his current standing in the polls.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the announcement, mention his criticism, then his background, the scandal, his leadership, his political work, and his poll position.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay under 200 words. Make sure to include all important aspects without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends correctly. I'll review it to make sure it's accurate and covers all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, making the public announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School. Christie criticized Washington lawmakers, including President Obama, for Congress's lack of productivity, which he said causes American anxiety. He emphasized the need for compromise and leadership, distancing himself from both parties' failures. Christie, a former federal prosecutor known for his blunt style, has served as governor since 2010, leading New Jersey through Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which boosted his popularity. However, his reputation was tarnished by the Bridgegate scandal in 2014, where his administration was involved in causing traffic jams as retaliation. Christie has also shifted his stance on Common Core education standards, initially supporting them but now opposing their implementation. Despite his polarizing style, Christie remains a moderate contender in the GOP field. END OF SUMMARY.
