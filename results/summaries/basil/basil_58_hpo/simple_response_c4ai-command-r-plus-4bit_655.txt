SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2016 presidential race, touting his tough-talking, no-nonsense attitude as a selling point for voters. However, his reputation has been marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal and his brash, confrontational style may not appeal to all. Christie's announcement focused on his home state and his criticism of the current political climate in Washington, positioning himself as a leader who can rise above partisan politics. He praised his own responsiveness and leadership during Hurricane Sandy and took aim at lawmakers for their lack of productivity, which he claims is causing anxiety among Americans. While Christie has faced challenges, such as the "Bridgegate" scandal and reversing his position on Common Core, he remains a formidable contender with a unique appeal. Christie's bid for the presidency is a bold move that may shake up the race, offering a different vision for the country and a break from traditional political norms. END OF SUMMARY.
