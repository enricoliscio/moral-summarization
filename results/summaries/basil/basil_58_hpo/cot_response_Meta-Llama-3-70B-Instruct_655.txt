SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential bid for 2016, calling for "courage" to stand up against the status quo. Christie criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of "compromise" and "leadership," which he believes has led to "anxiety" among Americans. The former federal prosecutor, known for his "blunt" speaking style, has a reputation for "bullying" and was involved in the "catastrophic" Bridgegate scandal. Despite this, Christie's favorability ratings soared after he demonstrated "responsiveness" and "leadership" during Hurricane Sandy. Christie has been working to ready himself for a White House run, holding prep sessions on foreign policy and raising money for Republican governors. However, his image has suffered from the Bridgegate controversy and his reversal on Common Core education standards. Christie remains in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates.
