SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his bid for the 2016 presidential election. In a public announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School, Christie emphasized the need for compromise in Washington and criticized lawmakers for their lack of productivity. He also praised his home state and highlighted his experience as governor, including his handling of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has served as governor since 2010 and has a reputation for being a tough talker. Despite a scandal involving lane closures on the George Washington Bridge, Christie's favorability ratings have remained strong. He has been preparing for a White House run, including holding prep sessions on foreign policy. Christie's blunt speaking style has sometimes been seen as brash and confrontational, but he argues that his job is to lead, not to be popular. He currently ranks in the middle of the pack among GOP presidential candidates.
