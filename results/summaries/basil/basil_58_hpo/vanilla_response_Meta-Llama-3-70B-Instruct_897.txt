SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Christie made the announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School, where he emphasized his commitment to fighting for the American people. He criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Obama, for their lack of productivity and compromise. Christie highlighted his experience as governor, including his leadership during Hurricane Sandy, and his ability to work across party lines. Despite his reputation for being tough-talking and confrontational, Christie has faced criticism for his role in the "Bridgegate" scandal and his reversal on Common Core education standards. Christie's favorability ratings have fluctuated over the years, but he remains a middle-of-the-pack candidate among GOP presidential hopefuls.
