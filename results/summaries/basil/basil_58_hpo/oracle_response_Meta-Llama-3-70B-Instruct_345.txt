SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2016 presidential bid, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for their lack of productivity, which he believes has led to American anxiety. He emphasized the need for compromise, stating that both parties have "failed our country" and that it's time to "stand up and say 'enough'." Christie's reputation as a tough-talking leader was reinforced by his handling of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which boosted his favorability ratings. However, his image suffered a blow in 2014 due to the "Bridgegate" scandal, where members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite these setbacks, Christie remains committed to leading the country, stating that his job is to "lead, and that's what I try to do."
