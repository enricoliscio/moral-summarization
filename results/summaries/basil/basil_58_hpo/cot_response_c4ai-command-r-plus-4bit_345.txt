SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, vowing to fight for the people of the United States. Christie, known for his tough-talking and blunt speaking style, has faced moral dilemmas during his tenure. The "Bridgegate" scandal, in which Christie's administration was implicated in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation, damaged his reputation and caused his negatives to rise sharply. He has also suffered criticism for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite these controversies, Christie has also been praised for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy and his work as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Christie's announcement focused on his willingness to stand up and fight against the failures of both political parties, which he believes have led to a lack of productivity and anxiety for Americans. The governor, who has served since 2010 and won reelection in a Democratic-leaning state, presents himself as a courageous leader who is ready to take on the challenges facing the nation.
