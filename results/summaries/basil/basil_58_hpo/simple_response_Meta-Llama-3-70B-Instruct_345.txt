SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States of America." Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, criticized lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, for a lack of productivity and compromise. He emphasized the need for courage and standing up against the status quo. Christie's reputation has been marred by the "Bridgegate" scandal, which damaged his favorability ratings. Despite this, he has remained a strong leader, having led New Jersey through Hurricane Sandy's devastation and serving as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Christie's moral framing emphasizes the importance of leadership, courage, and compromise, urging Americans to stand up against partisan politics and demand more from their leaders. His announcement marks a significant moment in the 2016 presidential race.
