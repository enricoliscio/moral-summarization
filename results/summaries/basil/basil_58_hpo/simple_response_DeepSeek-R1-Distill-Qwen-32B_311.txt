Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article about Chris Christie announcing his presidential run in 2016. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Christie announces his candidacy, criticizes Washington's productivity, mentions his background as governor, and touches on some controversies like Bridgegate and his stance on Common Core. 

I should focus on the moral elements. The author seems to highlight Christie's strong leadership during Hurricane Sandy and his criticism of Washington's gridlock. Also, his change in stance on Common Core might be portrayed as a reversal, which could affect his credibility. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating his announcement, then his criticisms, his leadership during Sandy, mention his political successes despite being in a Democratic state, the Bridgegate scandal, and his recent policy reversal. 

I should ensure that the summary reflects the author's framing, which seems to present Christie as a strong leader with some controversies. I'll avoid adding my own opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral aspects highlighted in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Chris Christie, New Jersey's Republican governor, announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, vowing to "fight for the people of the United States." In his public announcement, Christie criticized Washington's lack of productivity and bipartisan gridlock, calling for compromise and courage to address the nation's challenges. A former federal prosecutor, Christie has been known for his blunt, confrontational style, which gained him both admiration and criticism. His reputation took a hit in 2014 during the "Bridgegate" scandal, where his administration was implicated in causing traffic jams as political retaliation. Despite this, Christie's leadership during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 boosted his favorability, as he focused on recovery efforts over political ambitions. He later chaired the Republican Governors Association, using the role to prepare for a potential presidential run. Christie has also faced criticism for reversing his stance on Common Core education standards. His campaign highlights his tough leadership and criticism of Washington's dysfunction, but his image remains tarnished by past controversies.  
END OF SUMMARY.
