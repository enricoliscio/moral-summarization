SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Christie made the announcement at his alma mater, Livingston High School, where he emphasized the need for compromise in Washington and criticized lawmakers for their lack of productivity. He also praised his home state and highlighted his experience as governor, including his handling of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie, known for his blunt speaking style, has faced criticism for his role in the "Bridgegate" scandal and for reversing his position on Common Core education standards. Despite these controversies, Christie remains a contender in the GOP presidential field, with a favorability rating that puts him in the middle of the pack. Christie's announcement marks the latest development in the 2016 presidential election, which is shaping up to be a crowded and competitive field.
