SUMMARY: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has announced his intention to fight for the people of the United States of America by running for president in 2016. Christie, known for his tough-talking and blunt speaking style, has praised his home state and criticized lawmakers in Washington for their lack of productivity, which he believes is causing anxiety among Americans. He has positioned himself as a leader who is willing to stand up and say "enough" to the failures of both political parties, emphasizing the importance of compromise. Christie's reputation was tarnished in the "Bridgegate" scandal, where members of his administration were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams as political retaliation. However, he has also been recognized for his responsiveness and leadership during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when he chose to focus on his state instead of the presidential election. Christie has served as governor since 2010 and has worked to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S. He believes that he has the courage and experience to lead the country, despite his brash and confrontational style.
