SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly opposes Donald Trump's proposed border wall, declaring "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's plan is a "stupid" idea and that Americans will not elect him to the White House. However, he is concerned about Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet" who need to "open their eyes." Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to any political party, labeling him "egocentric." Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden made a thinly-veiled attack on Trump, decrying his "dangerous," "damaging," and "ill-advised" rhetoric. Biden emphasized that Trump's views do not represent the majority of American people. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall.
