SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's plan is misguided and warned Hispanic voters who support Trump that they are "followers of a false prophet" who will ultimately be harmed by his policies. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles are not aligned with either major party. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. The remarks come as Trump continues to stand by his initial comments, despite widespread criticism. Fox's warning to Hispanic voters and his criticism of Trump's character reflect a deep concern about the potential consequences of a Trump presidency.

END OF SUMMARY.
