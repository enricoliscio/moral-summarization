SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox believes that Trump is a "false prophet" who is leading Americans astray with his dangerous and damaging rhetoric. He questions Trump's allegiance to any political party and labels him as "egocentric". Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund such a "stupid and useless" wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plans for the wall, stating that it will only get taller if Mexico refuses to pay. This dispute gained more attention as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous and ill-advised. Biden defended the rights of reporters like Jorge Ramos, who had a public skirmish with Trump, to ask questions without fear of being silenced. Fox and others worry about the potential consequences for the U.S. if Trump gains power and follows through with his controversial plans.
END OF SUMMARY.
