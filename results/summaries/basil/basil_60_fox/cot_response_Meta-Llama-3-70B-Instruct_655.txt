SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed border wall, calling it a "f***ing wall" and stating that Trump should pay for it himself. Fox expressed concern about the results of the Nevada caucus, where Trump won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, and urged Hispanics to "open their eyes" to the reality of Trump's policies. He labeled Trump's followers as followers of a "false prophet" and warned that the nation would "fail" if it fell into the hands of a "crazy man". Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, calling him "egocentric". The comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless". U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, stating that it does not represent the view of the vast majority of the American people. END OF SUMMARY.
