SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected the idea of contributing to Donald Trump's proposed border wall, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's rhetoric is "dangerous" and that his presidency would lead the nation to "fail" if it "falls" into his hands. He urged Hispanic voters to "open their eyes" and not support Trump, calling them "followers of a false prophet" if they do. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, saying he's not a true Republican and is instead "egocentric". This echoes the sentiments of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall. The comments come as Trump continues to stand by his initial proposal, despite widespread criticism. Fox's words were a strong rebuke of Trump's "rhetoric", which he believes is "damaging" and "ill-advised".

END OF SUMMARY.
