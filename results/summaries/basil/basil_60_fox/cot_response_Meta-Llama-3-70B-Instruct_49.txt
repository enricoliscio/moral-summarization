SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's plan is a "false" promise that will harm the Hispanic community, and he urged them to "open their eyes" to the reality of Trump's "egocentric" and "dangerous" rhetoric. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to any political party, calling him "crazy" and saying his principles are not Republican or Democratic, but rather self-centered. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the "stupid" wall. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, calling Trump's rhetoric "dangerous", "damaging", and "ill-advised". END OF SUMMARY.
