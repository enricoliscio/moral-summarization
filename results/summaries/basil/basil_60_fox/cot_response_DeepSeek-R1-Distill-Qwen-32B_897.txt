Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's strong opposition to Donald Trump's proposed border wall. He uses strong language, calling it a "f***ing wall" and criticizes Trump for being a "false prophet" and "crazy man." He also questions Trump's political affiliation, calling him egocentric and not aligned with any party. Fox is concerned about the Hispanic vote for Trump and urges them to "open their eyes." His successor, Calderón, also rejects paying for the wall, calling it "stupid." Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller, which is a bit of a pun. There's also mention of Ramos confronting Trump and Biden criticizing Trump's rhetoric as dangerous.

For the moral framing, I need to identify the words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "false prophet," "crazy man," "stupid," "dangerous," "egocentric," "hosting," and "benefit" stand out. These words convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Now, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these morally framed words. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Fox's opposition, his criticism of Trump, the Hispanic vote concern, Calderón's stance, Trump's response, Ramos's confrontation, and Biden's criticism.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the important elements without being too detailed. Let me structure it by starting with Fox's strong opposition, then his criticism of Trump, followed by Calderón's rejection, Trump's response, Ramos's encounter, and Biden's comments. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the original framing.

Let me draft it: Vicente Fox strongly opposes Trump's wall, calling it a "f***ing wall" and criticizes Trump as a "false prophet" and "crazy man." He's concerned about Hispanics supporting Trump, urging them to "open their eyes." Calderón agrees, calling the wall "stupid." Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller. Ramos confronted Trump, highlighting press freedom. Biden criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, emphasizing it doesn't represent most Americans.

I think that covers all the points and includes the moral words. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. It seems to be around 150 words, so it's good.
