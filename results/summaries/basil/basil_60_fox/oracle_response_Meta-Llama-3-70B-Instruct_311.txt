SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed border wall, stating "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's rhetoric is "dangerous" and that Americans will not elect him to the White House. However, he is concerned about Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet" who need to "open their eyes" to the reality of Trump's egocentric and divisive policies. Fox questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, saying he is not a true Republican and his principles are not aligned with the party's values. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless". The interview comes after Trump's continued insistence on building the wall and getting Mexico to pay for it, and amidst criticism from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who called Trump's rhetoric "dangerous" and "ill-advised".
