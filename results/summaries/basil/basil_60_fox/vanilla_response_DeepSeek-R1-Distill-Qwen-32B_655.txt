Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's comments on Donald Trump's proposed border wall. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

First, Fox is clear he won't pay for the wall. He told Jorge Ramos that Trump should pay since he has the money. Fox doesn't think Trump will win the presidency but is concerned about Trump's strong showing among Hispanic voters in Nevada, specifically 44%. He calls Trump a "false prophet" and urges Hispanics to "open their eyes," saying they won't benefit from Trump's administration.

Fox also criticizes Trump's political stance, saying he's not a Republican or Democrat but just egocentric. He echoes his successor Felipe Calderón, who also said Mexico won't pay for the wall. Trump responded by saying the wall would be taller because Mexico refused to pay. 

Additionally, there's mention of Ramos' past confrontation with Trump during a press conference, where Trump's security tried to remove him. Ramos stood up for his rights as a journalist. Vice President Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous, not representing most Americans.

So, the summary should include Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his concern about Hispanic support for Trump, his criticism of Trump's politics, the echo from Calderón, Trump's response, Ramos' encounter, and Biden's comments. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll condense each point concisely.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has firmly rejected paying for Donald Trump's proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, stating Trump should fund it himself. Fox criticized Trump's appeal to Hispanic voters, urging them to "open their eyes" and not support a "false prophet." He described Trump as egocentric and not aligned with any political party. Fox's comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also vowed Mexico would not contribute to the wall. Trump responded by joking the wall would be taller due to Mexico's refusal. The interview came amid U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Mexico, where he criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous and not representative of most Americans. Fox's remarks also followed Jorge Ramos' confrontation with Trump during a press conference, where Ramos defended his right to ask questions. END OF SUMMARY.
