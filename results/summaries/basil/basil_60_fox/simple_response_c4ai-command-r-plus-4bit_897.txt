SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also rejected the idea of Mexico funding such a project. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plan, stating that the wall will be built and Mexico will pay for it. Fox expressed concern about Trump's growing support among Hispanics, urging them to recognize Trump as a "false prophet" who will lead the country astray. He also questioned Trump's political allegiance, calling him "egocentric." Fox's stance was supported by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous" and not representative of American values. Fox's interview with Jorge Ramos took place around the same time as Biden's visit to Mexico for an economic summit, highlighting the concerns of both countries' leaders about Trump's divisive and controversial policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
