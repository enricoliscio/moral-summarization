Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing Donald Trump's proposal for a border wall. Fox is explicit about not wanting Mexico to pay for it. He also criticizes Trump's policies, particularly his appeal among Hispanic voters in Nevada. Fox refers to Trump as a "false prophet" and warns Hispanics not to be deceived. He also questions Trump's political affiliation, calling him egocentric and not aligned with any party. Additionally, the article mentions Fox's successor, Felipe Calderón, who also opposes paying for the wall. Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller, implying Mexico's refusal makes it more necessary. There's also a mention of journalist Jorge Ramos being removed from a press conference by Trump's security and his subsequent return. Finally, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden criticizes Trump's rhetoric as dangerous during a visit to Mexico.

Now, I need to create a concise summary that includes the morally framed words: take, fail, falls, republican, egocentric, tried, silence, right, ask, rhetoric, dangerous.

I should start by highlighting Fox's opposition to paying for the wall and his criticism of Trump. Mention the concern about Hispanic support, the characterization of Trump as a false prophet, and the warning about the nation failing. Include the point about Trump not being a Republican or Democrat, labeling him egocentric. Then, touch on Calderón's stance and Trump's response. Add Ramos's experience with Trump trying to silence him and his right to ask questions. Finally, mention Biden's criticism of Trump's dangerous rhetoric.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes all the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.
