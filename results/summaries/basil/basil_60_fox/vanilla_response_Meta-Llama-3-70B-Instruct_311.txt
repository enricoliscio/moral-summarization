SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying he won't pay for it and that Trump should foot the bill. Fox expressed concern over Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus, calling them "followers of a false prophet" and urging them to "open their eyes" to the potential dangers of a Trump presidency. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles don't align with either party. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. The interview comes amid a heated debate over Trump's controversial rhetoric, with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticizing Trump's "dangerous" and "ill-advised" comments.
