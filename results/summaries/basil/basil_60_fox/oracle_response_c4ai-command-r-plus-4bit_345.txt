SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has vehemently rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it a "false prophecy." Fox expressed concern about Trump's growing support among Hispanics, warning them not to be misled by Trump's dangerous and damaging rhetoric. He believes that Trump is egocentric and that his election would be damaging to both Mexico and the United States. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not pay for such a wall. Meanwhile, Trump has doubled down on his stance, claiming that the wall will be even taller if Mexico refuses to cooperate. This dispute comes as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visits Mexico and indirectly criticizes Trump's rhetoric as dangerous and unrepresentative of American values. Fox's interview with Jorge Ramos highlights the moral dilemma of a potentially damaging political movement that threatens the well-being of both nations.
END OF SUMMARY.
