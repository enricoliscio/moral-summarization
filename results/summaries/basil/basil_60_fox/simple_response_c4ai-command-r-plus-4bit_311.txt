SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has vehemently opposed Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and has declared that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox believes that Trump is a "false prophet" who is leading Americans astray with his extreme and divisive rhetoric. He questions Trump's allegiance to any political party, calling him "egocentric." Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund such a "stupid and useless" wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plan and has stated that the wall will get "taller" with such opposition. This controversy surrounds a larger context of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which has been denounced by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden as "dangerous" and not representative of American values. Fox and Biden both emphasize the importance of standing up against such divisive and harmful ideas.
END OF SUMMARY.
