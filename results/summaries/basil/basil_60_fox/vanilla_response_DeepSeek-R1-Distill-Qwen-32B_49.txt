Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's comments regarding Donald Trump's proposed border wall. He's pretty clear that Mexico won't pay for it. He uses strong language, saying he won't pay for that "f***ing wall" and that Trump should pay since he has the money.

Fox also talks about Trump's chances in the election, doubting he'll win but expressing concern over Trump's 44% Hispanic vote in Nevada. He criticizes Hispanic supporters, calling them followers of a "false prophet" and urges them to "open their eyes." He believes Trump would harm the nation if elected, not just Mexico but the U.S. as a whole.

Additionally, Fox questions Trump's political affiliation, saying he's neither Republican nor Democrat, just egocentric. His comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also refused to pay for the wall. Trump, in response, said the wall would be taller if Mexico refused, showing his determination.

The article also mentions Jorge Ramos, a journalist who had a confrontation with Trump during a press conference. Ramos was removed but later returned, emphasizing his right to ask questions. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Biden visited Mexico, subtly criticizing Trump's rhetoric as dangerous.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Fox's refusal to pay, his criticism of Trump and Hispanic supporters, his view on Trump's political stance, Calderón's support, Trump's response, Ramos's incident, and Biden's comments. I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
