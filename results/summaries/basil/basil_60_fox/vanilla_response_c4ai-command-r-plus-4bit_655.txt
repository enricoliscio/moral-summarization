SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox stated that he strongly opposes Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox criticized Trump's divisive rhetoric and questioned his political allegiance, calling him "egocentric". He also expressed concern about Trump's appeal to Hispanic voters, urging them to "open their eyes". Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund the wall. Trump has stood by his wall proposal, stating that the wall will get "taller" in response to Mexico's refusal to pay. This exchange comes amidst US Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Mexico, where he indirectly criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous". Biden emphasized that such rhetoric does not represent the views of most Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
