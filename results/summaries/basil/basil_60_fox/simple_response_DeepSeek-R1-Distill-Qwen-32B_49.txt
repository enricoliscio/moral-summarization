Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should highlight the key moral points without losing the essence.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is strongly against Trump's border wall, saying Mexico won't pay. He criticizes Trump's policies, especially regarding Hispanics supporting him. Fox warns that Trump's leadership could harm the nation and questions his political alignment. His successor, Calderón, also opposes the wall. Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller if Mexico refuses. The article also mentions Ramos's confrontation with Trump and Biden's criticism of Trump's rhetoric.

Now, I need to structure this into a concise summary. I should include Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his concern about Hispanic support, criticism of Trump's policies, Calderón's stance, Trump's response, Ramos's experience, and Biden's comments. Each point should be brief but capture the moral tone, like Fox's concern for the nation and Biden's attack on dangerous rhetoric.

I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words, using clear and direct language. I'll start with Fox's refusal, then his concerns, Calderón's statement, Trump's reaction, Ramos's incident, and Biden's criticism. I'll end by tying it to the broader implications of the election.

Double-checking to ensure all key moral elements are included without unnecessary details. Making sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has firmly rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, calling it "f***ing" and stating, "I’m not going to pay for that." Fox criticized Trump's leadership, warning that Hispanics supporting Trump are following a "false prophet" and urged them to "open their eyes" to the dangers of Trump's administration. He emphasized the need to defend the nation, not just a race or creed, and accused Trump of being egocentric and unaligned with any political party. Fox's comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also vowed Mexico would not contribute to the wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless." Trump has responded by doubling down on his wall proposal, stating it would "just got taller" if Mexico refuses to pay. The article also highlights journalist Jorge Ramos's confrontation with Trump during a press conference, where Trump's security team briefly removed Ramos, sparking debate over press freedoms. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous" and "damaging," emphasizing that it does not reflect the majority of Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
