SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has unequivocally rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!” Fox criticized Trump, calling him a "false prophet" and warning Hispanic voters not to support him, as they would not benefit from his administration. Fox also questioned Trump's political allegiance, labeling him as egocentric and not a true Republican or Democrat. His comments align with those of his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also vowed Mexico would not fund the wall. Trump has remained steadfast in his stance, even after Calderón's refusal. The interview with Fox occurred amid U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Mexico, where Biden criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous." Additionally, the article references Jorge Ramos' past confrontation with Trump during a press conference, highlighting tensions between the media and the candidate. END OF SUMMARY.
