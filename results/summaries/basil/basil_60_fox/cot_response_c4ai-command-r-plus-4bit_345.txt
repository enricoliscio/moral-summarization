SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, vowing never to pay for it. Fox believes that Trump, whom he calls a "false prophet," is a dangerous, egocentric, and crazy man who will lead the nation to failure if elected. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund such a "stupid and useless" wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plan and has even increased the wall's height in response to Mexico's refusal to pay. This controversy has sparked moral concerns, with prominent figures like Fox and US Vice President Joe Biden criticizing Trump's rhetoric as dangerous, damaging, and ill-advised. Biden emphasizes that Trump's views do not represent the values of most Americans. The article also highlights Jorge Ramos' public confrontation with Trump, showcasing the right to question and challenge authority, especially when it comes to defending one's race and nation. Fox's plea to Hispanics in the US to "open your eyes" underscores the moral dilemma at stake in this divisive political landscape.
