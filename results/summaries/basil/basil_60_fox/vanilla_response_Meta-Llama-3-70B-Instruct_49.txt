SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's plan is misguided and that Americans will not elect him as President. He is concerned about Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, saying he is "egocentric" and does not represent the party's principles. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. The remarks come as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric.
