SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's plan is misguided and that Americans will not elect him to the White House. He is concerned, however, about Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet" who need to "open their eyes" to the potential dangers of a Trump administration. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, labeling him as "egocentric" and not adhering to traditional party principles. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. The remarks come as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during an economic summit in Mexico.
