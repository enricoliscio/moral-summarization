SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox strongly condemns Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and vows that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox expresses concern about Trump's growing support among Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus, calling Trump a "false prophet" who will lead the country astray. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing the negative impact of Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies on both Mexico and the United States. Fox's sentiments are echoed by his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also rejects the idea of Mexico financing the wall. In response to Calderón's comments, Trump insists that the wall will be even taller, showcasing his indifference to the concerns of Mexico and his determination to push forward with his controversial plan. The article also mentions Jorge Ramos's previous confrontation with Trump, highlighting the journalist's right to question public figures, regardless of his immigrant status. Vice President Joe Biden, during his visit to Mexico, criticizes Trump's rhetoric as dangerous and contrary to American values. Fox's, Calderón's, Biden's, and Ramos's statements collectively demonstrate a moral stance against Trump's divisive and detrimental policies, calling for a more inclusive and respectful approach to international relations and immigration.
