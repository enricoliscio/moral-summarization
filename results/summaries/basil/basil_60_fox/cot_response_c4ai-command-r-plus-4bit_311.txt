SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vincente Fox emphatically stated that Mexico will not pay for Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Fox believes that Trump is a *false prophet* who is leading his followers astray with his *egocentric* and *dangerous* rhetoric. He warned Hispanics in the U.S. not to be *wrong* by falling for Trump's promises, as he believes a Trump administration would be *damaging* for the nation. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund such a *stupid* and *useless* wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plans for the wall and has even stated that it will get *taller* if Mexico refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, during his visit to Mexico, indirectly criticized Trump's rhetoric as *incredibly ill-advised* and not representative of most Americans' views.
END OF SUMMARY.
