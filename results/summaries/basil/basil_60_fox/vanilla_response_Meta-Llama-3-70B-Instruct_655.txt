SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Americans will not elect Trump as president, but is concerned about Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus. Fox criticized Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles are not Republican or Democratic. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. Trump has maintained that Mexico will pay for the wall, despite Mexican leaders' opposition. The comments come as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric.
