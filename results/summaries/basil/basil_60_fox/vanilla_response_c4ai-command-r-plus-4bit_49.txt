SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox adamantly refused to contribute to Donald Trump's proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, stating that Trump should pay for it himself. Fox expressed concern about Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus and criticized Trump's divisive and egocentric nature. Fox's comments echo those of another former Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n, who also rejected the idea of Mexico paying for the wall. Trump has stood by his proposal despite opposition from Mexico and some U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous and damaging, emphasizing that it does not represent the views of most Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
