SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejects Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it a "f***ing wall" and stating that Trump should pay for it himself. Fox is concerned about the results of the Nevada caucus, where Trump won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, and urges Hispanics to "open their eyes" to the reality of Trump's "false prophet" leadership. Fox also questions Trump's allegiance to any political party, labeling him "egocentric". Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the "stupid wall". Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden made a thinly-veiled attack on Trump, decrying his "dangerous" and "damaging" rhetoric. Fox's strong stance against Trump's proposal is a call to defend the nation from falling into the hands of a "crazy man".
