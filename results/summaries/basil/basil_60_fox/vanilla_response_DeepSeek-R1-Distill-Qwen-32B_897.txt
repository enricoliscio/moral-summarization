Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user has provided an article where former Mexican President Vicente Fox comments on Donald Trump's proposed border wall and Trump's candidacy. I should read through the article carefully to identify the key points.

First, Fox is against paying for the wall and criticizes Trump. He mentions that he doesn't think Trump will win but is concerned about the Hispanic vote in Nevada. He advises Hispanics to not support Trump, saying it's not about race or creed but the nation's future. Fox also questions Trump's political allegiance, calling him egocentric. His comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also refused to pay for the wall.

Additionally, the article mentions Trump's response, the role of journalist Jorge Ramos, and Biden's criticism of Trump's rhetoric during his visit to Mexico.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his criticism of Trump, the Hispanic vote concern, and his advice. Then mention Trump's response and the broader context with Calderón and Biden. I should keep it concise, ensuring all main points are covered without unnecessary details.

Now, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Fox's stance, moving to his concerns, Trump's reaction, and the context with other figures. I'll make sure to stay within the word limit and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, stating he will not contribute to its funding and calling Trump a "crazy man." Fox criticized Trump's appeal to Hispanic voters in Nevada, urging them to "open their eyes" and not support a candidate he deems harmful to the nation. He also questioned Trump's political allegiance, labeling him egocentric and not aligned with any party. Fox's comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also rejected paying for the wall. Trump, however, has vowed to build the wall, even after Mexico's refusal. The interview with Fox occurred as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico, indirectly criticizing Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
