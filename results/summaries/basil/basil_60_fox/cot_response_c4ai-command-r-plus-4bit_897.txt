SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox stated unequivocally that Mexico will not fund Donald Trump's proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Fox believes Americans won't elect Trump but is concerned by the latter's success among Hispanic voters in Nevada. Fox called Trump a "crazy" and "egocentric" man, echoing his successor Felipe Calder√≥n's assertion that Mexico won't pay for a "stupid wall." Trump responded by saying the wall will now be taller. This exchange reflects a larger issue of divisive and "dangerous," "damaging," and "ill-advised" rhetoric in U.S. politics, with Vice President Joe Biden also criticizing Trump during a visit to Mexico. Biden asserted that Trump's stance does not represent the views of most Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
