SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's plan is misguided and warned Hispanic voters who support Trump that they are "followers of a false prophet" who will ultimately be harmed by his policies. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles are not aligned with either party. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. The criticism of Trump comes as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also denounced Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during a visit to Mexico. Fox's warning to Hispanic voters is a moral imperative, urging them to "open their eyes" and recognize the harm that Trump's policies could bring to the nation.

END OF SUMMARY.
