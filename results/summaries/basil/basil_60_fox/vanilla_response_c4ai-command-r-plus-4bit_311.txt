SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox reiterated his strong opposition to Donald Trump's proposed wall along the US-Mexico border and asserted that Mexico will not pay for its construction. Fox expressed concern about Trump's popularity among some Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus and urged Hispanics in the US to recognize Trump as a "false prophet." He also questioned Trump's political allegiance, claiming he is "egocentric." Fox's sentiments echo those of another former Mexican President, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also stated that Mexico would not fund such a "stupid and useless" wall. Trump has maintained his stance on the wall despite criticism, stating that Mexico will pay for it. Meanwhile, US Vice President Joe Biden indirectly criticized Trump during an economic summit in Mexico, referring to his rhetoric as "dangerous" and unrepresentative of most Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
