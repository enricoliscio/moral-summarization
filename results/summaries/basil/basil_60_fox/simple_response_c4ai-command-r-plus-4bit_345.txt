SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox staunchly opposes Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and vows that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox criticizes Trump's divisive and egocentric rhetoric, warning Hispanics in the U.S. not to follow a "false prophet" who will lead the nation to ruin. Fox's comments echo those of another former Mexican President, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also rejected the idea of paying for the wall. Trump, undeterred by criticism, insists that the wall will be built and that Mexico will foot the bill. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden, during a visit to Mexico, indirectly criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous and unrepresentative of American values. Fox's defiant stance against Trump's wall highlights the moral dilemma of upholding international cooperation and mutual respect between nations, instead of divisive and discriminatory policies that threaten to undermine democratic principles.

END OF SUMMARY.
