Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's strong opposition to Trump's border wall proposal. He explicitly refuses to contribute any funds and criticizes Trump's policies. Fox also expresses concern about Trump's support among Hispanic voters, calling them followers of a "false prophet" and urging them to "open their eyes." He believes Trump's leadership would lead to the nation's failure and criticizes Trump for being egocentric and not aligned with any political party.

Additionally, Fox's comments are in line with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also rejects paying for the wall. Trump, however, remains committed to his plan, even after Mexico's refusal. The article also mentions journalist Jorge Ramos's confrontation with Trump, emphasizing the importance of free speech and the right to ask questions. U.S. Vice President Biden criticizes Trump's rhetoric as dangerous, highlighting the divide between Trump's views and the majority of Americans.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided: take, fail, falls, republican, egocentric, tried, silence, that, right, ask, rhetoric, dangerous. I should ensure these words are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to include Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his criticism of Trump's policies, concern over Hispanic support, and the implications for the nation. I'll also mention Calderón's stance, Trump's response, Ramos's experience, and Biden's criticism. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal, then move on to his concerns about Trump's support and the nation's potential failure. I'll include his criticism of Trump's egocentric nature and lack of party allegiance. Next, I'll mention Calderón's rejection and Trump's response. Then, I'll cover Ramos's confrontation and the importance of the right to ask questions. Finally, I'll note Biden's criticism of Trump's dangerous rhetoric.

I need to ensure that all the morally framed words are appropriately included without forcing them. The summary should flow naturally while highlighting the moral aspects as presented in the article.

Fox expressed concern over Trump’s 44% Hispanic vote in Nevada, calling those supporters followers of a "false prophet" and urging them to "open their eyes." He emphasized the need to defend the nation hosting them, warning that it would fail if led by Trump. Fox’s comments mirror his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also rejected paying for the wall. Trump, however, remains steadfast, even after Mexico’s refusal. Meanwhile, journalist Jorge Ramos highlighted the importance of the right to ask questions, recalling his confrontation with Trump, where he was nearly silenced. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump’s rhetoric as dangerous, emphasizing that it does not represent most Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
