SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, vowing that Mexico will not pay for such a "stupid" and "useless" project. Fox denounced Trump as a "crazy," "egocentric" man who is leading his followers astray with "dangerous," "damaging," and "ill-advised" rhetoric. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund Trump's "false" and divisive plans. Trump, however, remains adamant about his wall proposal and has threatened to make it "taller" in response to Mexico's refusal to pay. This exchange comes amidst concerns over Trump's growing appeal among Hispanic voters in the U.S., with Fox urging Hispanics to "open their eyes" to the true nature of Trump's dangerous and divisive agenda. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, during his visit to Mexico, also criticized Trump's rhetoric, assuring that it does not represent the views of most Americans.
