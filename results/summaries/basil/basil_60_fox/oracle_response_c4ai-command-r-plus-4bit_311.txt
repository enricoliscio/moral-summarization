SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has strongly rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, using explicit language to express his disapproval. Fox believes that Trump is a "false prophet" who is leading Americans astray with his extreme views and that he is not a true Republican but rather an "egocentric" individual. He warns that the nation will fail and "fall into the hands of a crazy man" if Trump is elected. This sentiment echoes the words of Fox's successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also stated that Mexico will not fund such a "stupid and useless" wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plans for the wall, stating that it will only get taller if Mexico refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Jorge Ramos, a Mexican-born journalist, had a public dispute with Trump, asserting his right to ask questions as a reporter and an immigrant. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has also criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during an economic summit in Mexico, emphasizing that it does not represent the views of most Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
