SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes that Trump's plan is a "stupid" idea and that he is an "egocentric" and "crazy" man who will lead the nation to failure if elected. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, saying he is not a true Republican and does not represent the views of the majority of Americans. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's "dangerous" and "damaging" rhetoric, saying it does not represent the views of most Americans. Fox urged Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes" and not support Trump, who he called a "false prophet." END OF SUMMARY.
