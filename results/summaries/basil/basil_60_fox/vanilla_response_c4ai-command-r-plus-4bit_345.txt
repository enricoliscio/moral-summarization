SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has stated his strong opposition to Donald Trump's proposed wall along the US-Mexico border, vowing that Mexico will not pay for its construction. Fox believes that Trump is a "crazy man" and a "false prophet" who does not represent the values of either the Republican or Democratic parties. He also expressed concern about Trump's appeal to Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus, urging them to "open their eyes" and not fall for Trump's promises. Fox's comments echo those of another former Mexican President, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not pay for the wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plans for the wall and has stated that it will get "taller" in response to Mexico's refusal to pay. Meanwhile, US Vice President Joe Biden has criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous" during an economic summit in Mexico, emphasizing that it does not reflect the views of most Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
