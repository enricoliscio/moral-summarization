SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes that Trump's plan is misguided and that Hispanics who support Trump are "followers of a false prophet." He urges them to "open their eyes" and recognize that Trump's administration would be detrimental to the nation. Fox also questions Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles are not aligned with either major party. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. The remarks come as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during an economic summit in Mexico. Fox's strong stance against Trump's proposal is a call to action for Americans to reject Trump's divisive and harmful policies.
