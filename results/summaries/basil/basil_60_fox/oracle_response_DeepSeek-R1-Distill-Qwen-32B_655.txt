Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral implications.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing Donald Trump's border wall proposal. Fox is clear that Mexico won't pay for it and criticizes Trump's policies and character. He also comments on Trump's support among Hispanics in Nevada and warns them about following Trump, calling him a "false prophet." Fox questions Trump's political allegiance and describes him as egocentric. Other Mexican leaders, like Felipe Calderón, also oppose paying for the wall. Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller, and there's mention of Jorge Ramos, a journalist who faced issues with Trump's security during a press conference. U.S. Vice President Biden criticizes Trump's rhetoric as dangerous.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: take, fail, falls, republican, egocentric, tried, silence, that, right, ask, rhetoric, dangerous. I should structure the summary to highlight Fox's opposition, his concerns about Trump's impact, the political implications, and the broader critique of Trump's approach.

I'll start by stating Fox's refusal to pay for the wall. Then, mention his concern about Trump's support among Hispanics, using "take" to describe following Trump. I'll note his warning about the nation failing if Trump wins. Then, Fox's criticism of Trump as egocentric and not aligned with any party. Mention Calderón's agreement. Then, Trump's response about the wall getting taller. Include Ramos's experience with Trump's attempt to silence him, using "tried" and "silence." Finally, Biden's criticism of Trump's dangerous rhetoric. Make sure all the key points and moral words are included without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox firmly opposes Donald Trump's plan for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!” He criticized Trump, calling him a "false prophet" and warning Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes" as following Trump would lead them astray. Fox expressed concern that Trump's leadership could cause the nation to "fail" and described Trump as "egocentric," not aligned with any political party. His comments echoed those of his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also rejected paying for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless." Trump responded by saying the wall would "just got taller" after Mexico's refusal. Meanwhile, journalist Jorge Ramos recounted Trump's attempt to "silence" him during a press conference, emphasizing his "right" to ask questions. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, asserting it does not reflect the majority of Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
