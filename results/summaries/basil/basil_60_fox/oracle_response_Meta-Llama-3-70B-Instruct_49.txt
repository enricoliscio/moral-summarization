SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed border wall, calling it a "f***ing wall" and stating that Trump should pay for it himself. Fox expressed concern about the results of the Nevada caucus, where Trump won 44% of the Hispanic vote, and warned Hispanics in the US to "open their eyes" to the dangers of a Trump administration. He criticized Trump's allegiance to no political party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles are not Republican or Democratic. Fox's comments echoed those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall. Fox's interview came after Trump's security team tried to silence journalist Jorge Ramos, who has the right to ask questions as a citizen, immigrant, and reporter. US Vice President Joe Biden also denounced Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, saying it does not represent the view of the vast majority of Americans.
