SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has vehemently rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it a "f***ing wall." Fox believes that Trump is a "false prophet" who will lead his country to failure if elected. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to any political party, describing him as "egocentric." These sentiments echo those of Fox's successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also asserted that Mexico will not fund such a "stupid and useless" wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plans for the wall, stating that it will only get taller if Mexico refuses to pay. Meanwhile, Jorge Ramos, a Mexican-born journalist, faced a public skirmish with Trump, who tried to silence him by having him removed from a press conference. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, assuring that it does not represent the views of most Americans. Fox fears that if Trump's harmful and damaging rhetoric wins over Americans, the nation will fall into the hands of a crazy man and fail.
END OF SUMMARY.
