SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Fox believes that Trump is a false prophet who is leading Americans astray with his dangerous and damaging rhetoric. He questions Trump's allegiance to any political party and labels him as egocentric. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also stated that Mexico will not fund such a stupid and useless wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about building the wall and making Mexico pay for it. This dispute has caused a public skirmish between Trump and Spanish-language news icon Jorge Ramos, who confronted Trump during a press conference. Vice President Joe Biden has also indirectly criticized Trump, stating that his rhetoric is not representative of American values. Fox warns Americans, especially Hispanics, to open their eyes and not fall into the hands of a crazy man, as it would be dangerous for the nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
