Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's comments on Donald Trump's proposed border wall. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that Fox refuses to contribute to Trump's wall, saying he won't pay for it and that Trump should. He doesn't think Trump will win the presidency but is concerned about Trump's 44% Hispanic vote in Nevada. Fox criticizes Trump, calling him a false prophet and warns Hispanics not to support him, saying they'll regret it. He also questions Trump's political allegiance, calling him egocentric, not a Republican or Democrat. Fox's comments are similar to his successor, Calderón, who also said Mexico won't pay for the wall. Trump responded by saying the wall will be taller because Mexico refused to pay. The article mentions Jorge Ramos's confrontation with Trump, where Ramos was removed from a press conference but later returned. Ramos defended his right to ask questions. It also notes that Vice President Biden visited Mexico and criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his criticism of Trump and the Hispanic support, his view on Trump's political stance, mention Calderón's similar stance, Trump's response, Ramos's incident, and Biden's criticism. I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Fox's refusal and his comments on Trump. Then mention the Hispanic vote concern. Add his warning to Hispanics. Then his view on Trump's political party. Include Calderón's statement. Trump's response about the wall. Then mention Ramos's incident and Biden's visit with criticism. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and concise.
