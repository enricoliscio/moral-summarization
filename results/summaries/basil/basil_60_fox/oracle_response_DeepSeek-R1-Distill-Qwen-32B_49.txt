Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and identify the moral terms.

The article talks about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's strong opposition to Trump's border wall, using the word "take" when he says Trump will take Hispanics to the desert. He also warns that the nation will "fail" if Trump becomes president. Fox describes Trump as "egocentric" and not a Republican. There's mention of Fox's interview with Jorge Ramos, where Ramos was almost silenced by Trump's security, which relates to the word "silence." Fox urges Hispanics to "open their eyes," implying they should recognize the danger, which ties into the "right" to question authority. Trump's "rhetoric" is described as "dangerous" by Biden.

I should structure the summary to include these moral terms. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, then his concerns about Trump's support among Hispanics, using "take" and "fail." I'll mention Trump's egocentric nature and his party stance. Include Ramos's experience being silenced and the call to open eyes, highlighting the right to question. Finally, note Trump's response and Biden's criticism of his dangerous rhetoric.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all the moral terms are included. Let me draft this, ensuring each key point is covered with the specified words.

SUMMARY:  
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly opposes Donald Trump's proposed border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" He criticizes Trump for being "egocentric" and not aligned with Republican principles. Fox expresses concern over Trump's 44% Hispanic support in Nevada, urging Hispanics to "open their eyes" and not follow a "false prophet." He warns that Trump's leadership could "take" the nation to failure, emphasizing the need to defend the host country, not just their race or creed. Fox also condemns Trump's "rhetoric," calling it dangerous and urging Hispanics to recognize the risks of supporting him. Meanwhile, Fox's successor, Felipe Calderón, echoed his stance, vowing Mexico would not fund the "stupid wall." Trump responded by doubling down, saying the wall would "get taller" if Mexico refused to pay. The interview came amid U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's criticism of Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, asserting it does not represent most Americans. Ramos, a journalist, highlighted his right to ask questions, despite being nearly silenced by Trump's security. END OF SUMMARY.
