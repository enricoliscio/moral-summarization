Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points. The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing Donald Trump's border wall proposal and his comments on Trump's supporters.

Hmm, Fox is clearly against the wall and says Mexico won't pay for it. He also criticizes Trump's supporters, especially the Hispanic vote in Nevada, calling them followers of a "false prophet." That's a strong moral statement, indicating Fox believes Trump is misleading them.

I need to make sure the summary captures Fox's disapproval of Trump's policies and his concern about the voters. Also, mention Fox's view on Trump not belonging to any party and being egocentric. Including Trump's response about the wall getting taller is important for context.

The user also mentioned that the summary should end with "END OF SUMMARY." and be under 200 words. I should keep it concise but include all main points: Fox's refusal to pay, criticism of Trump's supporters, Trump's response, Ramos's incident, and Biden's comments.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Fox's main points, then Trump's reaction, the context with Ramos, and Biden's criticism. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like Fox's concern for the nation and the false prophet comment.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, that's within the limit. I think this captures all the necessary elements and preserves the moral framing as the author intended.
