SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejects Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes Trump's rhetoric is "dangerous" and "damaging" and that his election would be a disaster for the U.S. and its Hispanic community. Fox questions Trump's allegiance to any political party, calling him "egocentric" and saying his principles are not Republican or Democratic. Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. Fox urges Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes" and not support Trump, warning that his administration would lead to the nation's downfall. Fox's strong stance against Trump's proposal is a moral imperative, emphasizing the need to defend the nation and its values against a "crazy man" who would lead it to failure.
