SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has adamantly refused to support Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, declaring that he will not pay for such a "f***ing wall." Fox expresses concern about Trump's growing support among Hispanics, calling Trump a "false prophet" who will lead them astray. Fox warns that electing Trump would be a disaster for the United States, referring to him as a "crazy" and "egocentric" man who does not truly represent either major political party. These sentiments echo those of another former Mexican president, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also rejected the idea of Mexico paying for Trump's wall. Trump, however, remains defiant and insists that Mexico will bear the cost. The article also highlights a previous confrontation between Trump and prominent journalist Jorge Ramos, who accused Trump of trying to silence him. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has joined the chorus of critics, condemning Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous," "damaging," and "incredibly ill-advised." Biden assures that Trump's views do not reflect those of most Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
