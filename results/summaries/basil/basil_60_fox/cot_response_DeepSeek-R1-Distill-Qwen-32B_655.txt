Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "chip," "f***ing," "false prophet," "fail," "crazy," "egocentric," "stupid," "hosting," "benefit," "open your eyes," "defend," "principles," "silence," "citizen," "right," "dangerous," "damaging," "ill-advised," "represent," "vast majority." These words are used to convey judgment or moral stance in the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include these morally charged words. I'll start by highlighting Fox's refusal to pay for the wall and his criticism of Trump. Then, mention the Hispanic vote in Nevada and his warning to them. Include his assessment of Trump's character and allegiance. Also, note Calderón's stance and Trump's response. Finally, add Ramos's experience and Biden's criticism of Trump's rhetoric.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the key points without losing the moral framing. I'll make sure each sentence reflects the original's tone and includes the identified words where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**  
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox firmly opposes Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, stating he will not contribute to its cost. Fox criticized Trump, calling him a "false prophet" and warning Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes" as Trump's administration would not benefit them. He accused Trump of being "crazy" and "egocentric," not aligned with any political party. Fox's comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also rejected paying for the "stupid" wall. Trump responded by doubling down on his plan, saying the wall would "just got taller." Meanwhile, journalist Jorge Ramos highlighted his confrontation with Trump, emphasizing the importance of free speech. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during a visit to Mexico. Fox and Calderón's statements reflect a broader rejection of Trump's policies and rhetoric, while Trump remains steadfast in his vision. END OF SUMMARY.
