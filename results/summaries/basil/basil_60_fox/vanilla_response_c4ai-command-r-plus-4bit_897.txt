SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox has strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and asserted that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox expressed concern about Trump's popularity among a portion of the Hispanic community in the Nevada caucus. He urged Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes" and not follow a "false prophet." Fox also questioned Trump's political allegiance, calling him "egocentric." Fox's comments echo those of another former Mexican President, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also stated that Mexico would not pay for the wall. Trump has stood firm on his proposal, claiming that the wall will get "taller" if Mexico refuses to pay for it. The article also mentions Jorge Ramos' interview with Fox and Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Mexico, where he criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous."
