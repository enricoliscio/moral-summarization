Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. The user wants a concise summary, up to 200 words, using the specified moral terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is against Trump's wall and criticizes Trump's policies and character. He questions Trump's support among Hispanics and warns about the consequences. Fox also comments on Trump not aligning with any party, calling him egocentric. His successor, Calderón, also opposes paying for the wall. Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller. The article also mentions Ramos' confrontation with Trump and Biden's criticism of Trump's rhetoric.

Now, I'll identify the moral terms to include: take, fail, falls, republican, egocentric, tried, silence, right, ask, rhetoric, dangerous. I need to incorporate as many as possible without forcing them.

I'll start by highlighting Fox's refusal to pay for the wall and his criticism of Trump. Mention the concern over Trump winning Hispanic votes, using "take" metaphorically. Include his warning about the nation failing if Trump wins. Note Fox's description of Trump as egocentric. Mention Ramos' experience being silenced and his right to ask questions. Finally, include Biden's criticism of dangerous rhetoric.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each moral term is naturally included. Keep the summary under 200 words, making sure it's concise yet comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each point is covered and the moral terms are preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to make sure all key points are included and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox firmly opposes Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!” He criticizes Trump, questioning his Republican allegiance and calling him "egocentric." Fox expresses concern over Trump winning 44% of the Hispanic vote in Nevada, urging Hispanics to "open their eyes" and not follow a "false prophet." He warns that Trump's leadership could "take" the nation to ruin, emphasizing the need to "defend the same nation" hosting them. Fox also condemns Trump's rhetoric as dangerous, echoing his successor, Felipe Calderón, who vows Mexico will not fund the wall. Trump has responded by doubling down on the wall, declaring it will be "taller" after Mexico's refusal. Meanwhile, journalist Jorge Ramos, who was briefly silenced during a Trump press conference, defended his right to ask questions, highlighting the importance of free expression. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during a visit to Mexico. END OF SUMMARY.
