SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vincente Fox emphatically rejected the idea of Mexico paying for Donald Trump's proposed border wall, calling Trump a "false prophet" who is leading his followers astray. Fox expressed concern about Trump's popularity among some Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus, urging Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes" and realize that a Trump administration would be detrimental to the nation. He questioned Trump's political allegiance, labeling him as "egocentric." Fox's comments echo those of another former Mexican President, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also rejected the idea of paying for the wall. Trump, however, remains adamant about his plans for the wall and has stated that Mexico will bear the cost. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden, during an economic summit in Mexico, criticized Trump's rhetoric as "dangerous" and not representative of American values. Fox's interview with Jorge Ramos occurred around the same time as Biden's visit, highlighting the growing concerns about Trump's divisive and controversial campaign.
END OF SUMMARY.
