Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are about former Mexican President Vicente Fox criticizing Donald Trump. He's against Trump's border wall plan and says Mexico won't pay for it. He also criticizes Trump's support among Hispanics in Nevada, calling them followers of a false prophet. Fox believes Trump isn't aligned with any party and is just egocentric. His successor, Calderón, also opposes paying for the wall. Trump responds by saying the wall will be taller if Mexico refuses. Ramos, a journalist, had a confrontation with Trump, which Fox mentions. Biden also criticizes Trump's rhetoric during a visit to Mexico.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Fox's opposition to the wall, his criticism of Trump's supporters, his view on Trump's political alignment, Calderón's stance, Trump's response, Ramos's incident, and Biden's comments. I need to make sure the moral tone is kept, like Fox calling Trump a false prophet and Biden saying Trump's rhetoric is dangerous.

Let me structure it: Start with Fox's opposition to the wall and his comments on Hispanics supporting Trump. Mention his view on Trump's egocentric nature. Include Calderón's agreement. Then Trump's response. Add Ramos's incident briefly. Finally, Biden's criticism. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear without going over the word limit.

I should also ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly. Avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Let me draft it now, keeping an eye on the word count.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly opposed Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!” He criticized Trump as a "false prophet" and warned Hispanics in the U.S. to "open their eyes," as Trump's administration would not benefit them. Fox also accused Trump of being egocentric and not aligned with any political party. His successor, Felipe Calderón, echoed his stance, declaring Mexico would not fund the wall. Trump responded by suggesting the wall would be taller if Mexico refused to pay. Fox's comments came after journalist Jorge Ramos was briefly removed from a Trump press conference for challenging him. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric during a visit to Mexico, emphasizing that Trump does not represent most Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
