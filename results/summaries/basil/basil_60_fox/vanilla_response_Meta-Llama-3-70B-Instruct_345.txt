SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, stating that he won't pay for it and that Trump should foot the bill. Fox expressed concern over Trump's popularity among Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus, calling them "followers of a false prophet." He also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, labeling him as "egocentric." Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. Trump has consistently maintained that Mexico will pay for the wall, despite opposition from Mexican leaders. The comments come as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Mexico for an economic summit, where he criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric.
