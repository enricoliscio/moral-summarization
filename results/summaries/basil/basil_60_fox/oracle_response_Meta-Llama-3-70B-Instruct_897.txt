SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly opposes Donald Trump's proposed border wall, refusing to contribute to it and questioning Trump's allegiance to the Republican party. Fox believes Trump's principles are "egocentric" and not in line with Republican values. He also expresses concern about the results of the Nevada caucus, where Trump won 44% of the Hispanic vote, calling those who support Trump "followers of a false prophet." Fox urges Hispanics in the US to "open their eyes" and recognize that a Trump administration would "take them to the desert" and ultimately lead to the nation's downfall, saying "this nation is going to fail if it falls into the hands of a crazy man." Fox's comments echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." The article highlights the morally charged language used by Fox, including warnings about the "dangerous" rhetoric of Trump and the importance of exercising one's "right" to ask questions and speak out.
