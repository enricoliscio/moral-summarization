Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's strong opposition to Trump's border wall proposal. He explicitly refuses to pay for it and criticizes Trump's policies. Fox also expresses concern over Trump winning Hispanic votes in Nevada, calling his supporters followers of a "false prophet." He urges Hispanics to "open their eyes" and not support Trump, emphasizing the importance of defending the nation they're in, not just their race or creed.

Fox also questions Trump's political allegiance, stating he's neither a Republican nor a Democrat, just egocentric. His comments align with his successor, Felipe Calderón, who also refuses to pay for the wall. Trump, in response, has upped his rhetoric, making the wall taller in response to Mexico's refusal. The article also mentions Jorge Ramos' confrontation with Trump, where Trump tried to silence him, and Ramos stood up for his rights as a journalist. Additionally, Vice President Biden criticized Trump's rhetoric as dangerous during his visit to Mexico.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, highlighting Fox's moral stance against Trump, his criticism of Hispanic support, the refusal to pay for the wall, Trump's response, and the broader context of political criticism and media confrontation.

I should make sure to include key points: Fox's refusal, criticism of Trump's policies, concern over Hispanic support, his call for awareness, the political stance against Trump, the media confrontation, and Biden's criticism.

I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral framing, showing Fox's disapproval and the implications for national unity and immigration policies.
