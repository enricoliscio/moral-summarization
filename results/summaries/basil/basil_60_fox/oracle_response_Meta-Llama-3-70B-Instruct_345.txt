SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejected the idea of paying for Donald Trump's proposed border wall, stating "I'm not going to pay for that f***ing wall!" Fox believes that Trump should pay for it himself, as he has the means. Fox expressed concern about the results of the Nevada caucus, where Trump won 44% of the Hispanic vote, calling those who voted for him "followers of a false prophet." He warned that a Trump administration would "take them to the desert" and urged Hispanics to "open their eyes" to the potential dangers. Fox also questioned Trump's allegiance to the Republican party, labeling him "egocentric" and not a true Republican. The comments echo those of Fox's successor, Felipe Calder√≥n, who also refused to pay for a border wall. US Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's "dangerous" rhetoric, stating that it does not represent the views of the majority of American people. Fox's strong stance against Trump's wall and rhetoric emphasizes the importance of defending the nation and its values. END OF SUMMARY.
