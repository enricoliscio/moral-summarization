SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, stemming from his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, rather than an independent "search for the truth." Grimm asserts his innocence and will continue to "serve" his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The Justice Department has been investigating Grimm for two years, looking into allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. The congressman was also in the news recently for physically "threatening" a reporter. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. His lawyer is confident that Grimm will be "vindicated" when the dust settles.

END OF SUMMARY.
