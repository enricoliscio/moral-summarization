SUMMARY:

In a disturbing display of political vendetta, Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against the congressman, rather than an independent search for truth. Despite the allegations, Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. This development comes on the heels of a January incident where Grimm physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol. The Justice Department has been investigating Grimm for two years, initially focusing on erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. The indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days, and Grimm is likely to turn himself in. This egregious abuse of power raises serious questions about the integrity of our justice system.

END OF SUMMARY.
