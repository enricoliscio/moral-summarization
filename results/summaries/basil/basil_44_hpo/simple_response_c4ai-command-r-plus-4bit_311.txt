SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm of New York is expected to be indicted by the U.S. Attorney's office on charges of mail and wire fraud, according to a statement from Grimm's lawyer. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, denounced the charges as a "politically driven vendetta" and expressed confidence that Grimm would be vindicated. The charges stem from Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also examined erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during Grimm's first congressional campaign. Separately, Grimm made headlines earlier this year for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Despite the indictment, Grimm intends to continue serving his constituents, citing his dedication and public service as a congressman, Marine Corps veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent. The indictment has already been handed down by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn and is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
