SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, stemming from his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. His lawyer claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his "innocence of any wrongdoing." The lawyer expresses disappointment in the government's decision, but is confident that Grimm will be "vindicated" when the truth comes out. Despite the allegations, Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication and tenacity" that has characterized his lifetime of public service. This development comes after Grimm was in the news for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed.
END OF SUMMARY.
