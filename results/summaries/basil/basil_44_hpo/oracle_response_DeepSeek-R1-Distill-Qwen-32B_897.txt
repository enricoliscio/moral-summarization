Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to be indicted. His lawyer says the government is pursuing a politically driven vendetta, not an independent search for truth. They believe he's innocent and will be vindicated. The charges involve mail fraud and wire fraud related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI. The investigation started two years ago over campaign finance issues and improper donations. Recently, he threatened a reporter. The Washington Post says he's already been indicted secretly and will turn himself in soon.

The author used words like vendetta, search, vindicated, serve, fraud, filed, accepted, threatened. I need to include these terms in the summary. 

I should structure the summary to highlight Grimm's situation, the charges, the lawyer's response, and the context of the investigation. I'll make sure to use the moral terms as they were presented to maintain the framing.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words and using those key moral words.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face indictment on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, linked to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, claims the government is pursuing a politically driven vendetta rather than an independent search for truth, asserting Grimm's innocence and predicting his eventual vindication. The investigation began two years ago over allegations of erroneous campaign finance filings and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Recently, Grimm threatened a reporter in the Capitol. The Washington Post reports he has been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the indictment set to be unsealed soon. Grimm continues to serve his constituents, as a dedicated public servant with a background in the Marine Corps and the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
