SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges including mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, called the indictment a "politically driven vendetta" and expressed confidence that Grimm would be vindicated. The charges are said to focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago, with allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. In addition to financial wrongdoing, Grimm has also faced scrutiny for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol earlier this year. Despite the indictment, Grimm's lawyer emphasized that the congressman will continue to serve his constituents and maintain his dedication to public service. Grimm is reportedly expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed.
END OF SUMMARY.
