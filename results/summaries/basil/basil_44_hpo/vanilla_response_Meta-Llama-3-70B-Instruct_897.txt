SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, according to his lawyer. The indictment is believed to include charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. The Justice Department has been investigating Grimm for two years, initially focusing on allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing and claims the investigation is politically motivated. He is expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. The second-term congressman represents New York's 11th District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. Grimm was recently in the news for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol.
