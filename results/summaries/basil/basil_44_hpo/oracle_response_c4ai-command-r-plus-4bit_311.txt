SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm of New York is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, claims that the investigation has been a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm is innocent of any wrongdoing. He asserts that Grimm will be "vindicated" when the truth is revealed. The charges relate to Grimm's conduct concerning a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also includes allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Separately, Grimm was involved in an incident where he physically threatened a reporter. Despite the charges, Grimm plans to continue to serve his constituents, showcasing his dedication and tenacity as a public servant, Marine Corps veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent. Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, and the indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
END OF SUMMARY.
