SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, stemming from his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, rather than an independent search for the truth. Grimm asserts his innocence and will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. However, this is not Grimm's first controversy; he was investigated two years ago for allegedly filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations. More recently, he physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. His lawyer believes that when the dust settles, Grimm will be vindicated.

END OF SUMMARY.
