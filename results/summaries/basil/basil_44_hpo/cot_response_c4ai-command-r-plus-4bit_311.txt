SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face indictment by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, according to his lawyer, William McGinley. McGinley expressed disappointment in the government's decision, calling it a "politically driven vendetta." The charges are expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud related to Grimm's conduct with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm has asserted his innocence, and his lawyer believes he will be vindicated. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago, focusing on erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. The case also involves an incident where Grimm physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Despite the indictment, Grimm remains dedicated to serving his constituents and will continue his public service career. The indictment was secretly filed and is expected to be unsealed in the coming days. Grimm represents New York's 11th District, encompassing Staten Island and part of Brooklyn.
