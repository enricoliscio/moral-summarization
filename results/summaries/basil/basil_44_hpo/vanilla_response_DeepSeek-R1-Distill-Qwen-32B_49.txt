Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says that Grimm's lawyer announced he's expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney. The charges are related to mail fraud and wire fraud, involving his health food restaurant after leaving the FBI. The Justice Department started investigating him two years ago for campaign finance issues and improper donations. There's also mention of him threatening a reporter in January. His lawyer claims the case is politically motivated and that Grimm is innocent. The Washington Post adds that he's already been secretly indicted and will turn himself in soon.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main facts: who is involved, the charges, the background of the investigation, Grimm's response, and the latest update about the indictment.

I'll start by stating that Grimm is expected to be indicted, mention the fraud charges related to his restaurant. Then note the investigation started two years ago regarding campaign finances. Include the recent incident with the reporter. Highlight his lawyer's statement about political motives and Grimm's innocence. Finally, add the update from the Washington Post about the secret indictment and his expected surrender.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all essential points without going over the word limit. Let me structure it step by step to ensure clarity and conciseness.
