SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, said that the charges are a result of a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The charges stem from Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm made headlines earlier this year for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm represents New York's 11th District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. According to reports, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury, and the indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
END OF SUMMARY.
