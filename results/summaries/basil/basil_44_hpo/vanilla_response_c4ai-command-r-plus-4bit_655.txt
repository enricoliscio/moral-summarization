SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, said that the government's decision to pursue charges is "politically driven" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The charges are reportedly related to Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago over allegations of improper campaign finance reporting and donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm has been in the news recently for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. He represents New York's 11th District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. According to an update, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, and the indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
END OF SUMMARY.
