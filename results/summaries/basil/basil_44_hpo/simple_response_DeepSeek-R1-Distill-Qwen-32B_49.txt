Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm being indicted. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by saying Grimm is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney. His lawyer, William McGinley, says the government is pursuing a politically driven vendetta, not an independent search for truth. He claims Grimm is innocent and will be vindicated. The charges are mail and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006. The Justice Department started investigating two years ago for campaign finance issues and improper donations. Also, Grimm threatened a reporter in January. He's a second-term congressman from Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. The Washington Post says he'll turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed, and now it's been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." and starting with "SUMMARY:". Also, I need to keep the moral framing, which in this case seems to be that the government is acting politically against Grimm, implying it's unfair or biased.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: expected indictment, lawyer's statement about political vendetta, charges related to the restaurant, campaign finance issues, threatening a reporter, his background, and the upcoming unsealing of the indictment.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all these elements without going over 200 words. Also, I should use the moral framing by highlighting that the lawyer claims it's a politically driven case.

Let me draft it:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted for mail and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant. His lawyer claims the investigation is politically motivated, not truth-seeking. Charges stem from 2006 after leaving the FBI. Earlier, he faced issues with campaign finances and threatened a reporter. He's a veteran and decorated FBI agent, representing Staten Island and Brooklyn. Indictment is secret but to be unsealed soon.

Wait, that's too short. Let me add more details to reach around 200 words without being too wordy.

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face indictment for mail and wire fraud tied to his Upper East Side health food restaurant, which he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. His lawyer claims the government's investigation is politically driven, not an independent search for truth, asserting Grimm's innocence. The Justice Department began looking into him two years ago for erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first campaign. Recently, Grimm threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Representing Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, he's a Marine Corps veteran and decorated FBI agent. The indictment, likely to be unsealed soon, highlights the politically charged nature of the case.

Hmm, that's about 150 words. Maybe add more about his background and the expected outcome.

That's about 120 words. I need to make it more detailed without exceeding 200.
