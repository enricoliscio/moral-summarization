SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. His lawyer claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. This is not the first time Grimm has been in the news for questionable behavior, as he was previously investigated for filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations. Additionally, he was in the news in January for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Despite these allegations, Grimm's lawyer claims he will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. However, it is clear that Grimm's actions are a breach of public trust and undermine the integrity of public office. His behavior is a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and ethical leadership in politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
