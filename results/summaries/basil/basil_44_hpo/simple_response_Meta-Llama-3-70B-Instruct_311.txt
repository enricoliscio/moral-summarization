SUMMARY:

In a disturbing display of alleged corruption, Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned. This is not Grimm's first brush with controversy, as he has been under investigation for two years for allegedly filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations. Moreover, he made headlines in January for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Despite his lawyer's claims of a "politically driven vendetta," the evidence suggests a pattern of wrongdoing. Grimm's assertion of innocence rings hollow in the face of these serious allegations. The fact that he will continue to serve his constituents while under indictment raises questions about the integrity of our political system. The indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days, and Grimm will likely turn himself in.

END OF SUMMARY.
