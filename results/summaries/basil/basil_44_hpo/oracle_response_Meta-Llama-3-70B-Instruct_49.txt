SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, allegedly committed during his ownership of a health food restaurant in Manhattan. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, rather than an independent search for the truth. Despite this, Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The investigation began two years ago, focusing on allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Recently, Grimm made headlines for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. The indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days, with Grimm likely to turn himself in. His lawyer is confident that Grimm will be vindicated when the dust settles.

END OF SUMMARY.
