Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article is about Rep. Michael Grimm facing indictment. I need to make sure I capture the key points: who, what, when, where, why, and how.

First, I should identify the main elements. The article mentions that Grimm's lawyer confirmed an expected indictment. The charges are mail and wire fraud related to his restaurant after leaving the FBI. The Justice Department started investigating two years ago for campaign finance issues and improper donations. Also, Grimm threatened a reporter earlier this year. The lawyer's statement accuses the government of a politically driven vendetta, and Grimm maintains his innocence.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Grimm is expected to be indicted, mention the charges, the lawyer's response, the allegations, and the threat incident. I should also note that the indictment is secret and will be unsealed soon.

I have to make sure the moral framing is preserved. The lawyer's statement accuses the government of a politically motivated action, so I should include that to show the moral perspective. Also, highlighting Grimm's dedication despite the allegations adds context.

Let me structure it: Indictment expected, charges, lawyer's response, allegations, threat incident, and the secret indictment status. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face criminal charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, stated that the government's case appears politically motivated, asserting Grimm's innocence and vowing his eventual vindication. The Justice Department began investigating Grimm in 2021 over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his 2010 congressional campaign. Additionally, Grimm recently threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm, a second-term congressman representing Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, plans to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. The Washington Post reported that Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the charges expected to be made public soon. END OF SUMMARY.
