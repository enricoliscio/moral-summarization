Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user is a news summarizer assistant, so my job is to take the article and condense it into a concise summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) facing an expected indictment. His lawyer, William McGinley, confirmed this, stating that the government is pursuing a politically motivated case. Grimm claims innocence and continues to serve his constituents. The charges involve mail and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006. The Justice Department started investigating him two years ago for campaign finance issues and improper donations. There's also a mention of him threatening a reporter in January. The Washington Post adds that he's already been indicted secretly and the indictment will be made public soon.

Now, I need to structure this into a summary. I should include the key elements: who, what, when, where, why. Start with Grimm being expected to be indicted, his lawyer's statement about the politically driven case, his assertion of innocence, the charges related to the restaurant, the previous investigation into campaign finances, the recent incident with the reporter, and the update about the secret indictment.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is concise. I'll start with the main news, then add the lawyer's comments, the charges, the background of the investigation, the recent incident, and the update on the indictment.

Let me check the word count as I go. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and adds necessary information without being redundant. Also, I should end with the required tokens: SUMMARY:... END OF SUMMARY.

I think that's all. Let me put it together.
