SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, who asserts his innocence. The investigation began two years ago over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm has been in the news recently for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. He is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. According to sources, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the indictment expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
