SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. His lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against Grimm, and that the congressman asserts his "innocence of any wrongdoing." Despite the expected indictment, Grimm's lawyer says he will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication and tenacity." This news comes after Grimm was in the spotlight for physically threatening a reporter in January. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. The congressman's lawyer expresses disappointment in the government's decision, but is confident that Grimm will be "vindicated" when the truth comes out.
