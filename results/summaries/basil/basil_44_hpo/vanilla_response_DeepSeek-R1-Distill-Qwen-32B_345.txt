Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the article mentions that Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, stated that the U.S. attorney plans to indict him. The charges are expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant after he left the FBI in 2006. The investigation started two years ago, looking into his campaign finances and improper donations. There's also a mention of him threatening a reporter in January.

Grimm's lawyer says the government is pursuing a politically driven case, and Grimm maintains his innocence. He's expected to turn himself in once the indictment is made public, and the Washington Post reports he's already been indicted secretly.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the expected indictment, the charges, the investigation details, Grimm's response, and the timeline of events. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and accurate.

Let me start by stating the main point: Grimm is expected to be indicted. Then mention the charges and the restaurant connection. Include the lawyer's statement about the politically driven case. Note the investigation into campaign finances and the recent incident with the reporter. Conclude with the expected surrender and the secret indictment info.

I should avoid any unnecessary details and ensure the summary flows logically. Also, make sure to mention his background as a Marine and FBI agent, as that adds context to his dedication to public service.

Okay, putting it all together in a clear and concise manner without exceeding the word limit.
