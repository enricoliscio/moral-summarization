Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Rep. Michael Grimm facing an indictment. The key points are: he's expected to be indicted on mail and wire fraud, related to his restaurant after leaving the FBI. His lawyer claims it's a politically driven vendetta, and Grimm maintains his innocence, expecting to be vindicated. He's also been in the news for threatening a reporter.

The user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: vendetta, search, vindicated, serve, fraud, filed, accepted, threatened. I should make sure these words are included.

I'll structure the summary to include Grimm's expected indictment, the charges, the lawyer's statement about the vendetta, Grimm's assertion of innocence, his expectation of being vindicated, and the recent threat incident. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the specified words.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary details without being too lengthy. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral term is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta, asserting that the government has not conducted an independent search for the truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and expects to be vindicated. The Justice Department began investigating him two years ago over allegations of filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations. Additionally, Grimm recently threatened a reporter in the Capitol. He remains dedicated to serving his constituents, as a congressman, Marine Corps veteran, and decorated FBI agent. The indictment is expected to be unsealed soon. END OF SUMMARY.
