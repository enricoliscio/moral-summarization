SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, stemming from his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. Grimm's lawyer claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman asserts his "innocence of any wrongdoing." Despite the expected indictment, Grimm's lawyer says he will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication and tenacity" and will be "vindicated" when the truth comes out. This news comes after Grimm was previously in the spotlight for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. The congressman's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven" case against Grimm, rather than an "independent search for the truth." END OF SUMMARY.
