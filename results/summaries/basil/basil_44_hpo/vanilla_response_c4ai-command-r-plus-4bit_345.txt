SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, said that the congressman asserts his innocence and believes he will be vindicated. The charges are reportedly related to Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm made headlines earlier this year for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. He represents New York's 11th District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. According to an update by the Washington Post, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, and the indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
END OF SUMMARY.
