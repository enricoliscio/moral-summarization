SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, claims that the investigation has been a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm is innocent of any wrongdoing. He asserts that Grimm will be "vindicated" when the truth is revealed. 

The charges against Grimm are connected to his conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also looked into allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donation acceptance during Grimm's first congressional campaign. 

Despite the legal troubles, Grimm intends to continue to "serve his constituents" and maintain his public service role. The indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days, and Grimm is likely to turn himself in. END OF SUMMARY.
