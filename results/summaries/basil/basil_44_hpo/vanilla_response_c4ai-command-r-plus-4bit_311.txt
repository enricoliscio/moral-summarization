SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York on charges including mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, stated that Grimm asserts his innocence and believes he will be vindicated. The charges are believed to focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago due to allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Separately, Grimm made headlines in January for physically threatening a reporter. According to The Washington Post, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury, and he is expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed.
