SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, according to his lawyer, who called the case a "politically driven vendetta." The charges stem from Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also uncovered erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during Grimm's first congressional campaign. In a statement, Grimm's lawyer asserted his innocence and claimed that he will be vindicated. The case against Grimm follows an incident in January where he threatened a reporter and the revelation that he has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury. Grimm, a Marine Corps veteran and decorated FBI Special Agent, represents New York's 11th District and is expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. END OF SUMMARY.
