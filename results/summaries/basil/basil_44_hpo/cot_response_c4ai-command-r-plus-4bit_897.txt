SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, according to a statement from his lawyer, William McGinley. The indictment is said to focus on Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence, claiming that the investigation has been a "politically driven vendetta" and not an independent search for the truth. The charges are expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud. The investigation into Grimm began two years ago, with allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Separately, Grimm made headlines earlier this year for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm has reportedly already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury and is expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. Grimm maintains his innocence and believes he will be vindicated of any wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
