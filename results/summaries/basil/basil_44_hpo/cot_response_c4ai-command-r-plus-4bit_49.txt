SUMMARY: 
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, according to his lawyer, who claims that the investigation has been a "politically driven vendetta." The charges stem from Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also looked into allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm's lawyer asserts the congressman's innocence and believes he will be vindicated. Notably, Grimm was also in the news earlier this year for threatening a reporter in the Capitol. According to reports, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury and is expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed.
END OF SUMMARY.
