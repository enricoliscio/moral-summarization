Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through the article first. 

Hmm, the key points are that Grimm is expected to be indicted, his lawyer's statement, the charges related to his restaurant, and his background. I need to make sure I include all these without going over 200 words. 

I should start with the main event: Grimm's expected indictment. Then mention his lawyer's response, highlighting the political vendetta angle. Next, the charges about mail and wire fraud from his restaurant after leaving the FBI. Also, the background on the investigation from two years ago, including campaign finance issues and the incident with the reporter. Finally, note that he's likely to turn himself in once the indictment is made public.

I need to keep it concise and clear, making sure each sentence adds necessary information without being redundant. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically into the next. I'll avoid any unnecessary details to stay within the word limit. 

Wait, the user mentioned the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly, making sure it's under 200 words. I think that's all. Let me put it together now.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face criminal charges, according to his lawyer, William McGinley, who stated that the U.S. attorney's office has disclosed its intent to file charges. The charges reportedly include mail fraud and wire fraud, stemming from his ownership of a health food restaurant in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm maintains his innocence, asserting that the investigation is politically motivated. The Justice Department began investigating him two years ago over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his 2012 congressional campaign. Grimm, who represents New Yorkâ€™s 11th District, recently gained attention for threatening a reporter in January. He is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed, with sources indicating he has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn. END OF SUMMARY.
