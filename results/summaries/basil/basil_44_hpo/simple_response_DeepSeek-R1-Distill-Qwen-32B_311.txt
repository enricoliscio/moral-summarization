Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm's expected indictment. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the key points while highlighting the political angle and Grimm's claims of innocence.

First, I'll note that Grimm's lawyer confirmed the expected indictment, mentioning mail and wire fraud related to his restaurant. I should include that the investigation started two years ago and the charges involve campaign finance issues. Also, the recent incident where he threatened a reporter is relevant.

I need to capture Grimm's lawyer's statement about it being a politically driven vendetta, emphasizing the political angle. Mentioning Grimm's background as a Marine and FBI agent adds context about his dedication. I should also include that the indictment is secret and will be unsealed soon.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is concise. The summary should start with the main points, then add context and background information. I'll end with the expected unsealing of the indictment.

Let me structure it: Start with the indictment, mention the lawyer's statement, the charges, the investigation's start, the restaurant details, the campaign finance issues, the recent threat, Grimm's background, and the current status of the indictment.

I need to ensure the moral framing is clear, so I'll highlight the lawyer's criticism of the government's motives. Also, include Grimm's assertion of innocence and his dedication to constituents despite the charges.

Double-checking the word count, making sure it's concise but covers all necessary points without being too lengthy. Okay, that should cover everything the user needs.
