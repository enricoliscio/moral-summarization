SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of alleged corruption, Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned. This development is the culmination of a two-year investigation by the Justice Department, which began with allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Grimm's lawyer claims the government's pursuit is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman will be vindicated when the truth comes to light. However, Grimm's own behavior has raised eyebrows, including a recent incident where he physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol. The congressman's assertion of innocence rings hollow in the face of such egregious allegations. It remains to be seen how Grimm will continue to serve his constituents while facing these serious charges.

END OF SUMMARY.
