Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm being indicted. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They provided a list of morally charged words that the author used: vendetta, search, vindicated, serve, fraud, filed, accepted, threatened. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Rep. Grimm is expected to be indicted on charges like mail fraud and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant. His lawyer claims the government is pursuing a politically driven vendetta, not an independent search for truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and says he'll be vindicated. He's been accused of filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations. Also, he threatened a reporter in January. The Washington Post says he's been secretly indicted and will turn himself in soon.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start with the indictment news, mention the charges, Grimm's lawyer's statement about the vendetta and search for truth. Include Grimm's assertion of innocence and his expectation of being vindicated. Mention his public service roles. Then, note the fraud charges related to the restaurant, the campaign finance issues, and the threat against the reporter. Finally, mention the secret indictment and his likely surrender.

I should use the moral words provided. So, words like vendetta, search, vindicated, serve, fraud, filed, accepted, threatened. I'll structure the summary to include these words naturally. Let me draft it step by step.

Start with the indictment, mention the lawyer's statement about vendetta and search. Then Grimm's innocence and vindication. His roles in public service. Then the fraud charges, filed and accepted in campaign finance. Threatened the reporter. Secret indictment and his surrender.

I need to make sure it's concise and flows well, not exceeding 200 words. Let me check the word count as I go. Maybe start with the expected indictment, lawyer's comments, Grimm's stance, the charges, campaign issues, threat, and the secret indictment.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant, according to his lawyer, William McGinley. McGinley accused the government of pursuing a politically driven vendetta rather than an independent search for the truth, emphasizing Grimm's innocence and his belief that Grimm will ultimately be vindicated. Grimm, a Marine Corps veteran and former FBI agent, continues to serve his constituents while maintaining his dedication to public service. The charges stem from allegations of filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations during his 2006 congressional campaign. Additionally, Grimm was involved in a January incident where he threatened a reporter in the Capitol. The Washington Post reported that Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the indictment expected to be unsealed soon. END OF SUMMARY.
