SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face an indictment by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, according to his lawyer, William McGinley. Grimm is accused of mail and wire fraud related to his conduct with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also uncovered erroneous campaign finance reports and the acceptance of improper donations during Grimm's first congressional campaign. In a separate incident, Grimm threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Despite the serious allegations, Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and believes he will be vindicated. Grimm, a dedicated public servant known for his tenacity, will continue to serve his constituents in New York's 11th District. Grimm plans to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. It has been reported that a federal grand jury in Brooklyn has already secretly indicted Grimm, with the indictment expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
