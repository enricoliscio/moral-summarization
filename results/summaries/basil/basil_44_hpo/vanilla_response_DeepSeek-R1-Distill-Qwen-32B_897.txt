Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the main points are that Grimm's lawyer says he's expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney. The charges include mail fraud and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant after leaving the FBI. The Justice Department started investigating two years ago for campaign finance issues and improper donations. Also, Grimm had a recent incident where he threatened a reporter. He's from New York's 11th District and is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is made public. The Washington Post adds that he's already been secretly indicted and it will be unsealed soon.

I should include all these points but keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start with the expected indictment, mention the lawyer's statement, the charges, the investigation details, the recent incident, his background, and the update from the Post. Make sure to structure it clearly and concisely without getting too wordy. Let me put it all together in a summary.
