Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article mentions that Grimm's lawyer says he's expected to be indicted on charges like mail and wire fraud related to his restaurant after leaving the FBI. The lawyer accuses the government of a politically motivated vendetta, not an independent investigation. Grimm maintains his innocence and is still serving his constituents.

I should highlight the key points: the expected indictment, the charges, the lawyer's response about political motives, Grimm's claims of innocence, and his ongoing service. Also, the context about his background as a Marine and FBI agent adds to his credibility, which is part of the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral perspective presented, emphasizing the political angle and Grimm's dedication despite the charges.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important detail is included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, accused the government of pursuing a politically motivated vendetta rather than an independent investigation, asserting Grimm's innocence. Grimm, a Marine Corps veteran and decorated FBI agent, continues to serve his constituents while awaiting the unsealing of the indictment. The Justice Department began investigating Grimm in 2021 over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Recent reports indicate he has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the charges expected to be made public soon. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing and remains dedicated to his public service. END OF SUMMARY.
