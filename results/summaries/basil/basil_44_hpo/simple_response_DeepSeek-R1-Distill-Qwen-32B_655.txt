Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. 

So, the article is about Rep. Michael Grimm facing an indictment. His lawyer says the government is pursuing a politically driven vendetta, not an independent search for truth. The charges include mail and wire fraud related to his restaurant after leaving the FBI. The Justice Department started investigating two years ago for campaign finance issues. He also had an incident where he threatened a reporter. Grimm maintains his innocence and says he'll be vindicated. The Washington Post says he's been secretly indicted and will turn himself in soon.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The lawyer's statement accuses the government of a politically motivated action, which implies a moral issue of fairness and justice. The article also mentions the charges and his background, so I should include that. 

I should start by stating the indictment, mention the lawyer's accusations, the nature of the charges, the investigation details, the reporter incident, his innocence claim, and the latest update on the indictment. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to highlight the moral aspects like the politically driven vendetta and his dedication despite the charges.

Let me structure it: Indictment expected, lawyer's statement on political vendetta, charges related to restaurant, investigation history, reporter incident, innocence claim, and the secret indictment update.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too wordy. Also, preserve the tone that suggests the government's actions are questionable, which is the moral framing here.

Okay, I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together succinctly.

McGinley accused the government of pursuing a politically driven vendetta against Grimm, asserting his innocence and claiming he will ultimately be vindicated. The charges reportedly involve mail fraud and wire fraud related to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI in 2006. The Justice Department began investigating Grimm in 2021 over alleged campaign finance violations and improper donations. Recently, Grimm was also involved in an incident where he threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm, who represents New Yorkâ€™s 11th District, continues to serve his constituents while maintaining his innocence. The Washington Post reported that Grimm has been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the indictment expected to be unsealed soon. END OF SUMMARY.
