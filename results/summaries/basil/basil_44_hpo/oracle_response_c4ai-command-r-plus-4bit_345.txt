SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, stated that the government's decision to pursue charges was a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The charges relate to Grimm's conduct connected to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also looked into allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during Grimm's first congressional campaign. Separately, Grimm was recently in the news for physically threatening a reporter. Despite the indictment, Grimm's lawyer emphasized that the congressman will continue to serve his constituents and that he will be "vindicated" when "the dust settles." Grimm is expected to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed.
END OF SUMMARY.
