SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, allegedly committed during his ownership of a health food restaurant in Manhattan. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, rather than an independent search for the truth. Despite this, Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The investigation, which began two years ago, also looked into allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. This news comes on the heels of a recent incident where Grimm physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. His lawyer believes that when the dust settles, Grimm will be vindicated.

END OF SUMMARY.
