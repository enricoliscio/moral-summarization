Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main subject is Rep. Michael Grimm facing an indictment. His lawyer says the charges are politically motivated, which is a moral frame. The article mentions mail fraud and wire fraud related to his restaurant after leaving the FBI. There are also allegations about campaign finance issues and a physical threat to a reporter. 

For the summary, I should include the indictment, the lawyer's statement about a politically driven vendetta, the fraud charges, and the additional allegations. I need to keep the moral words like "indictment," "fraud," "vendetta," and "wrongdoing." Also, mention his background and the upcoming unsealing of the indictment. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his ownership of a health food restaurant after leaving the FBI. His lawyer, William McGinley, claims the case is a politically driven vendetta, asserting Grimm's innocence and vowing his eventual vindication. The Justice Department began investigating Grimm in 2021, alleging erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Additionally, Grimm recently threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Despite these issues, Grimm continues to serve his constituents. The indictment, which has been secretly filed, is expected to be unsealed soon. END OF SUMMARY.
