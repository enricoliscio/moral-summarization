SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm of New York is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, stated that the government's decision to indict is politically motivated and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The charges are related to Grimm's conduct concerning a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also looked into allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. Despite the indictment, Grimm's lawyer emphasized that the congressman will continue to serve his constituents and uphold his dedication to public service. The indictment is a disappointing development that calls into question Grimm's integrity and commitment to the law, especially given his background as an FBI Special Agent.

END OF SUMMARY.
