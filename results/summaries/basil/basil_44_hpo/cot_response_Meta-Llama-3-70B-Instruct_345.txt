SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, and that Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing. Despite the expected indictment, Grimm's lawyer says he will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication and tenacity" and will be "vindicated" when the truth comes out. This development comes after a two-year investigation into Grimm's campaign finance reports and improper donations. The congressman has also been in the news recently for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. END OF SUMMARY.
