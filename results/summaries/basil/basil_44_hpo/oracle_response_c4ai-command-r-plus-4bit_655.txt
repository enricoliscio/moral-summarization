SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm of New York is expected to be indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, according to Grimm's lawyer. The charges are said to be in connection with Grimm's business dealings after he left the FBI in 2006. The investigation into Grimm's conduct has been ongoing for two years, with the Justice Department alleging erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his first congressional campaign. In addition to these allegations, Grimm made headlines earlier this year for threatening a reporter in the Capitol. Despite the expected indictment, Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and believes he will be vindicated. Grimm plans to continue serving his constituents, citing his dedication and public service as a congressman, Marine Corps veteran, and FBI Special Agent. The indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
END OF SUMMARY.
