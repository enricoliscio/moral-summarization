SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan. His lawyer, William McGinley, claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" against Grimm, rather than an independent search for the truth. Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. This is not Grimm's first controversy, as he was investigated two years ago for allegedly filing erroneous campaign finance reports and accepting improper donations. More recently, he physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. His lawyer believes that when the dust settles, Grimm will be vindicated.

END OF SUMMARY.
