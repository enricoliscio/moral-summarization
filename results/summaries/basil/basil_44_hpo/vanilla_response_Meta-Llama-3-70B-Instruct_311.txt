SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, according to his lawyer. The charges will reportedly include mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. The Justice Department has been investigating Grimm for two years, initially focusing on allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing and claims the government's pursuit is politically motivated. He will continue to serve his constituents in New York's 11th District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed, although it has been reported that he has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn.
