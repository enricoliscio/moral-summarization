SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, stated that the government's decision to indict is politically motivated and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The charges are reportedly related to Grimm's conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation also included allegations of improper campaign finance reporting and donations during his first congressional campaign. Grimm previously made headlines for physically threatening a reporter. Despite the indictment, Grimm's lawyer emphasizes that the congressman will continue to serve his constituents and uphold his duties, highlighting Grimm's past as a Marine Corps veteran and FBI Special Agent. Grimm has been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, and the indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
