SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican from New York, is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, expressed disappointment but not surprise at the government's "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman. The charges stem from Grimm's conduct related to a health food restaurant he owned after leaving the FBI in 2006. The investigation began two years ago due to allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during Grimm's first congressional campaign. Separately, Grimm made headlines earlier this year for physically threatening a reporter. Despite the indictment, Grimm's lawyer asserts his innocence and dedication to public service, and Grimm is expected to continue serving his constituents.
