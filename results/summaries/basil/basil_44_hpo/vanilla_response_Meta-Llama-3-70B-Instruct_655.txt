SUMMARY:

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned in Manhattan after leaving the FBI in 2006. Grimm's lawyer claims the government has pursued a "politically driven vendetta" against the congressman, who asserts his innocence. The Justice Department began investigating Grimm two years ago over allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Grimm has been in the news recently for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. The congressman, who represents New York's 11th District, is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed. According to recent reports, Grimm has already been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, with the indictment expected to be unsealed in the coming days.
