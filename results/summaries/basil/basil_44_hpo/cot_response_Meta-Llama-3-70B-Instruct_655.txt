SUMMARY:
Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his conduct at a health food restaurant he owned. His lawyer claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing. Grimm's lawyer expresses disappointment but not surprise, stating that "when the dust settles, he will be vindicated." Despite the expected indictment, Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity, as he has done throughout his lifetime of public service as a Marine Corps combat veteran and decorated FBI Special Agent. The investigation began two years ago, focusing on allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations. Grimm has also been in the news for physically threatening a reporter in the Capitol. END OF SUMMARY.
