Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The key is to include as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify the main points.

Rep. Michael Grimm is about to be indicted for mail and wire fraud related to his health food restaurant. His lawyer says the government is pursuing a politically motivated vendetta, not an independent search for truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and expects to be vindicated. He's been serving his constituents despite the allegations. The Justice Department started investigating him two years ago for campaign finance issues and improper donations. Recently, he threatened a reporter. The Washington Post says he's been secretly indicted and will turn himself in soon.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary using words like vendetta, search, vindicated, serve, fraud, filed, accepted, threatened. I'll structure it to include these terms naturally, making sure the summary is under 200 words and ends with the specified tokens.

I should start by stating Grimm's expected indictment, mention the lawyer's comments about the vendetta, Grimm's assertion of innocence and expectation of being vindicated. Then, note the fraud charges related to his restaurant, the ongoing investigation into campaign finances, and the recent threat incident. Finally, mention the secret indictment and his upcoming surrender.

Let me piece this together, ensuring all key points and moral words are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to face criminal charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud, related to his ownership of a health food restaurant. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, claims the government is pursuing a politically motivated vendetta rather than an independent search for the truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and expects to be vindicated. The charges stem from allegations of erroneous campaign finance reports and improper donations during his 2006 congressional campaign. Recently, Grimm threatened a reporter in the Capitol. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn has secretly indicted him, and the charges are expected to be unsealed soon. Grimm continues to serve his constituents as a second-term congressman representing Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. END OF SUMMARY.
