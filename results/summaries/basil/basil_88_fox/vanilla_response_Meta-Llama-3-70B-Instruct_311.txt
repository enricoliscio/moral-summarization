SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it costs the country billions of dollars and is unfair to citizens. He tweeted that the policy will be ended "one way or the other," citing the 14th Amendment's phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." Trump referred to a 1993 statement by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who opposed birthright citizenship, but later apologized and reversed his stance. Trump wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but critics argue it would require a constitutional amendment. Many Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, expressed skepticism about Trump's plan, while Democrats condemned it. Trump later shifted his stance, saying the issue will be settled by the Supreme Court.

END OF SUMMARY.
