Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and specified certain morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is vowing to end birthright citizenship, which he claims is unfair and costs the country billions. He's considering an executive order, which has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. The article mentions the 14th Amendment, critics' arguments, and reactions from lawmakers.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: unfair, ended, crime, entering, end, comes, restrict, immigration, come, introducing. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Trump's vow, the cost and unfairness, the 14th Amendment argument, reference to Harry Reid, the idea of an executive order, criticism from both sides, and the mixed reactions in Congress. 

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral terms. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Trump's statement, the reasons, the legal argument, the historical reference, the methods he's considering, the reactions, and the conclusion about the Supreme Court.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear, while making sure the moral framing is evident. For example, using "unfair" and "crime" to highlight the negative connotations Trump associates with birthright citizenship.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all the specified moral terms are included where appropriate. Making sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and a costly policy for the U.S. He argued that the 14th Amendment does not apply to children of non-citizens, sparking争议 among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Trump criticized former Senate Leader Harry Reid for his past stance on ending birthright citizenship, which Reid later reversed. Trump suggested using an executive order to restrict immigration by ending the practice, a move opposed by many scholars and lawmakers who argue it would require a constitutional amendment. Critics claim birthright citizenship encourages illegal immigration, while supporters view it as a fundamental right. Republicans like Lindsey Graham plan to introduce legislation to address the issue, while others, like Paul Ryan, argue the 14th Amendment is "pretty clear." Trump later shifted his stance, stating the matter would be settled by the Supreme Court. Democrats condemned his approach, with Nancy Pelosi calling it unrelated to his authority. END OF SUMMARY.
