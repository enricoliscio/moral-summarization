Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a response, but I want to make sure I understand the process correctly. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. These are words that carry a moral judgment or evaluation. I'll go through the article and pick out such words. For example, "unfair," "insane," "reward," "sane," "illegal," "crime," "apologized," "controversial," "ridiculous," "rewarded," "clear," "blasted," "carefully," "consider," "magnet," "condemnation," "authority," and "unconstitutional." These words carry moral connotations and are used to frame the issue.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and should reflect the moral arguments presented by both Trump and his critics.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Trump's vow to end birthright citizenship, his reference to the 14th Amendment, the criticism from Democrats, the mention of Harry Reid's past comments, the legal challenges, and the mixed reactions from Congress. I need to weave in the moral terms to maintain the framing.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, covering Trump's stance, the historical context with Reid, the legal and political reactions, and the moral arguments from both sides. I'll also note the opposition from Democrats and the potential for the issue to go to the Supreme Court.

Now, putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that includes the identified moral words, keeping it within the word limit. I'll make sure each sentence reflects the moral framing without losing the essential information from the article.

**SUMMARY:**

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing it is "unfair" and "costly," and suggested using an executive order to do so. Critics, including Democrats, have condemned this move, calling it "insane" and "unconstitutional." Trump referenced the 14th Amendment, claiming it does not apply to children of non-citizens, a stance scholars refute, stating a constitutional amendment would be required. He also cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's past comments opposing birthright citizenship, though Reid later apologized and reversed his position. Trump's proposal has sparked controversy, with some Republicans supporting legislative action while others, like Speaker Paul Ryan, argue the issue is best addressed by Congress. Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, have united in condemnation, accusing Trump of overstepping his authority. The issue remains contentious, with potential for resolution in the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
