Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article starts with Trump vowing to end birthright citizenship, referencing the 14th Amendment and suggesting it's not covered by it. He mentions Harry Reid's past comments to support his argument. There's some historical context about Reid changing his stance. Trump's plan to use an executive order is controversial, with Republicans and Democrats reacting differently. Some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, say it's not possible via executive order, while others like Lindsey Graham are introducing legislation. Trump later says it'll be settled by the Supreme Court. Democrats are against it, with Pelosi criticizing his overreach.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral arguments on both sides. Trump's argument is about fairness and cost, while critics argue it's a constitutional right. Also, the political divide is important—Republicans supporting or cautious, Democrats opposing. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points without getting too detailed.

I'll start by stating Trump's vow, mention the 14th Amendment argument, reference Reid's past stance, and note the political reactions. I should include the Republican and Democratic responses, and Trump's later shift to the Supreme Court. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is key.

Let me draft it: Trump vows to end birthright citizenship, citing the 14th Amendment and Harry Reid's past comments. Critics argue it's a constitutional right, and changing it would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans are mixed, with some supporting legislation, while Democrats condemn the move as overreach. Trump later says it'll be settled by the Supreme Court.

Wait, I should include the points about the cost, fairness, and the argument that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply. Also, mention that the U.S. isn't the only country with this policy. Maybe add that many scholars say it can't be changed via executive order. Also, include the political divide—Republicans cautious, Democrats united against.

I need to make sure it's all in a coherent, concise summary. Let me structure it step by step: Trump's statement, his reasoning, the 14th Amendment debate, the political reactions, and the shift to the Supreme Court. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's under 200 words and captures all the necessary elements.
