Okay, so I'm trying to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. They want the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible, like "unfair," "ended," "crime," etc.

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is vowing to end birthright citizenship, claiming it's unfair and costs the country billions. He's considering an executive order, which has caused disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. The article also mentions Harry Reid's past comments and the legal implications, as well as reactions from lawmakers.

I should identify the key moral words the author used. They listed: unfair, ended, crime, entering, end, comes, restrict, immigration, come, introducing. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

Next, I'll outline the main points to include:
1. Trump's vow to end birthright citizenship, calling it unfair and costly.
2. His reference to the 14th Amendment and his argument that it doesn't apply to non-citizens.
3. Mention of Harry Reid's past comments and his reversal.
4. Trump's comparison to other countries and the issue's contentious nature.
5. Legal and political reactions, including scholars' views and lawmakers' mixed responses.
6. Trump's shift in stance, acknowledging the Supreme Court might decide.
7. Democratic condemnation.

Now, I'll craft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral words and keep it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's vow, use "unfair," mention the 14th Amendment argument, reference Reid, discuss the policy's impact, and include the reactions and political shifts.

I should also ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without being too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and make sure all key points are covered with the required moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump vowed to "end" birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and costly, and argued it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. He criticized former Senate Leader Harry Reid for previously opposing the policy, which Trump claims "encourages" illegal immigration. Trump suggested using an executive order to "end" the practice, though scholars argue it would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans are divided, with some like Lindsey Graham introducing legislation to "restrict" birthright citizenship, while others, like Paul Ryan, oppose an executive order. Democrats condemned Trump's move, with Nancy Pelosi calling it "unconstitutional." Trump later shifted, stating the issue would be "settled" by the Supreme Court. The debate centers on whether the policy "comes" at the expense of U.S. citizens and whether it "introduces" incentives for illegal immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
