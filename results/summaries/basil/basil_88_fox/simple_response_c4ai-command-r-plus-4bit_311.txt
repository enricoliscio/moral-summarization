SUMMARY: President Trump caused controversy by vowing to end birthright citizenship, claiming it costs the country billions and is unfair to citizens. He cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments that no sane country would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants, though Reid later reversed his stance. Trump intends to use an executive order to end the practice, arguing it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. The move has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. While some Republicans support Trump's stance, others argue that an executive order is not the appropriate way to make such a significant change. Democrats have united in their criticism of Trump's plan, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling it an overreach of his authority. The issue of birthright citizenship has long been contentious in the US, with critics arguing it encourages illegal immigration and is not what the 14th Amendment intended. However, many scholars believe a constitutional amendment would be necessary to change the policy. The matter is expected to be settled by the Supreme Court.
END OF SUMMARY.
