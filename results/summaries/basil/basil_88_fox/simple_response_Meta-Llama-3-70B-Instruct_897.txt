SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it's unfair to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He argues that the 14th Amendment doesn't cover this policy because of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." Trump's stance has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Some Republicans, like Speaker Paul Ryan, argue that an executive order can't end birthright citizenship, while others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, plan to introduce legislation to address the issue. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have united against Trump's move, calling it an overreach of authority. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Trump's push to end birthright citizenship is rooted in a belief that it's unfair to US citizens and encourages illegal immigration, while his critics argue that it's a fundamental right granted by the Constitution and that changing it would require a constitutional amendment.
