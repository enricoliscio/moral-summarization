SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and claiming it encourages illegal immigration and costs the country billions of dollars. The move sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Trump's plan to use an executive order to end the practice was criticized by Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that it would require a constitutional amendment or legislative action. The 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to those born or naturalized in the US, has long been a contentious issue, with critics arguing that it was never intended to apply to children of two non-citizens, especially those who entered the country illegally. Sen. Lindsey Graham announced he would introduce legislation to address the issue, calling it a "magnet for illegal immigration." Trump's push to end birthright citizenship is part of his broader effort to restrict illegal immigration into the US, but it remains to be seen whether his administration can legally enact such a change without congressional action.
