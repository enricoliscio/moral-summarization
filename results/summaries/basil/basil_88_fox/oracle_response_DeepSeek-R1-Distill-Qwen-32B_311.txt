Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has specified certain morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump vowing to end birthright citizenship. He mentioned that it's unfair and costs the country billions. He's considering an executive order, which has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. The 14th Amendment is a key point here, as Trump argues it doesn't cover children of illegal immigrants. He referenced Harry Reid's past comments, which Reid later apologized for. The issue is contentious, with critics saying it encourages illegal immigration and others arguing it would require a constitutional amendment to change. Trump's approach has been met with mixed reactions from lawmakers, and Democrats are united against it.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: unfair, ended, crime, entering, end, comes, restrict, immigration, come, introducing. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating Trump's vow to end birthright citizenship, highlighting it as unfair. Mention the consideration of an executive order, which caused disagreement. Include his argument about the 14th Amendment and reference to Harry Reid. Note the criticism that it encourages illegal immigration and the counterarguments about constitutional amendments. Highlight the mixed reactions in Congress and Democrats' condemnation. Finally, mention Trump's shift towards the Supreme Court decision.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the key points and the specified words.
