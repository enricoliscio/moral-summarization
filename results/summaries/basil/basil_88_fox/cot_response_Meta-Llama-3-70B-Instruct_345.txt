SUMMARY:
President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, which he deemed "unfair" and "ridiculous," claiming it costs the country "billions of dollars." He cited a 1993 quote from former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who said that "no sane country" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on its soil. Trump argued that the 14th Amendment doesn't cover birthright citizenship, but many scholars disagree, saying it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Republicans are divided on the issue, with some opposing the use of an executive order, while Democrats are united in their "condemnation" of Trump's move. Trump appeared to shift his stance, saying the matter "will be settled by the United States Supreme Court." END OF SUMMARY.
