Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's recent statements on ending birthright citizenship. He mentioned this in a tweet, citing the 14th Amendment and claiming it's not covered by it. He also referenced Harry Reid's past comments, which he used to support his stance.

I should note that Trump suggested using an executive order, but there's disagreement among Republicans and criticism from Democrats. Some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, argue that the 14th Amendment is clear and an executive order isn't possible. Others, like Lindsey Graham, are planning legislation.

The article also mentions that the U.S. isn't the only country with birthright citizenship, but it's a contentious issue here, especially regarding illegal immigration. Scholars say changing this would require a constitutional amendment, making it a complex issue.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on Trump's vow, the legal and political reactions, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to include key points like the 14th Amendment, the potential use of an executive order, Republican and Democratic reactions, and the mention of the Supreme Court settling the matter.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's vow, mention the 14th Amendment argument, reference Harry Reid, then discuss the political reactions from both parties and the legal challenges. End with the Supreme Court angle and the ongoing debate.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details and keep each point brief. Make sure the summary flows logically and covers all essential aspects without exceeding the word limit.

He argued that the 14th Amendment does not cover such cases and criticized former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid for his past opposition to the policy. Trump suggested using an executive order to implement the change, though many scholars argue this would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans are divided, with some opposing the use of an executive order and others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, planning legislation. Democrats condemned the move, with Nancy Pelosi criticizing Trump's authority to make such a change. Trump later clarified that the issue would likely be settled by the Supreme Court. The debate highlights ongoing tensions over immigration and citizenship policies in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
