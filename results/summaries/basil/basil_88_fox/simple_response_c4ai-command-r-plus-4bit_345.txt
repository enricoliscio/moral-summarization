SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship in the United States, a move that has sparked moral controversy and ethical debates. Trump argues that birthright citizenship is "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He cites former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who once held a similar stance, saying no "sane country" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. However, critics argue that it would require a constitutional amendment to change the policy, and some lawmakers, including Speaker Paul Ryan, have stated that the 14th Amendment is clear in its protection of birthright citizenship. The issue has divided Republicans, with some supporting Trump's proposed executive order and others acknowledging that it is a matter for Congress to debate and decide upon. Democrats have united in their condemnation of Trump's plan, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dismissing his remarks as having "no relationship to what his authority is." The president's attempt to unilaterally deny rights guaranteed by the Constitution is a moral outrage and a legal overreach.
END OF SUMMARY.
