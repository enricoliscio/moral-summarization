SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship "one way or the other," despite the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the US. He argued that the amendment does not apply to children of non-citizens or illegal immigrants, claiming it costs the country billions and encourages illegal immigration. Trump's attempt to use an executive order to impose such a significant immigration change sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans asserted that birthright citizenship cannot be ended by executive order, while Democrats criticized Trump's move as an overreach of his authority. The debate over birthright citizenship has long been contentious in the US, with critics arguing it encourages illegal immigration and scholars countering that changing the policy would require a constitutional amendment. Trump's move shifted the stance on immigration, with even some Republicans announcing plans to introduce legislation to address the issue. The matter is expected to be settled by the Supreme Court.
END OF SUMMARY.
