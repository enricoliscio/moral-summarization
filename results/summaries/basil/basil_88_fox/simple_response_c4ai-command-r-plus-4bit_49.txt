SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing that it is unfair to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments, in which he opposed the practice of awarding citizenship to children of illegal immigrants, to support his case. Trump's plan to use an executive order to end birthright citizenship has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. While some critics argue that the 14th Amendment was never intended to apply to children of two non-citizens, others counter that changing the policy would require a constitutional amendment. The issue of birthright citizenship has long been a contentious one in the US, and Trump's move has been met with mixed reactions in Congress. Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans have stated that birthright citizenship cannot be ended by executive order, while Democrats have united in condemning Trump's plan. Trump has shifted his stance, acknowledging that the matter will likely be settled by the Supreme Court.
END OF SUMMARY.
