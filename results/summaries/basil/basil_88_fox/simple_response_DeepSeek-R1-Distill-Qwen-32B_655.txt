Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article starts with Trump vowing to end birthright citizenship, citing the 14th Amendment and referencing Harry Reid's past comments. It mentions that Trump wants to use an executive order, which has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. I should note that the 14th Amendment is a central point here, as Trump argues it doesn't cover children of illegal immigrants.

I also need to include the reactions from different lawmakers. Speaker Ryan says the 14th Amendment is clear and can't be changed via executive order. Senator Grassley is reviewing the proposal but thinks Congress should handle it. Senator Graham is introducing legislation, framing birthright citizenship as a magnet for illegal immigration. On the other side, Democrats, including Pelosi, are criticizing Trump, saying his proposal is outside his authority.

The article also mentions that the U.S. isn't the only country with birthright citizenship, but it's a contentious issue. Critics argue it encourages illegal immigration, while scholars say changing it would require a constitutional amendment.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral arguments from both sides. I should highlight Trump's position, the legal arguments, and the political reactions. Also, include the historical context with Harry Reid's comments and his later reversal.

I should structure the summary to start with Trump's vow, then touch on the legal and historical context, followed by the political reactions from both parties. Make sure to mention the mixed responses in Congress and the Democrats' criticism.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I'll need to be concise but cover all key points without getting too detailed. Also, preserve the moral framing, so include the arguments about fairness, cost, and the impact on immigration.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing it is unfair and costly, and claiming it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. He criticized the practice, which grants citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizens or illegal immigrants, and referenced former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments opposing the policy. Reid later reversed his stance, but Trump used his past remarks to support his argument. Trump suggested using an executive order to abolish the policy, though many scholars argue this would require a constitutional amendment. His proposal has sparked disagreement among Republicans, with some, like Speaker Paul Ryan, stating the 14th Amendment is clear and cannot be changed via executive order. Senator Lindsey Graham plans to introduce legislation on the issue, framing it as a "magnet for illegal immigration." Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have condemned Trump's proposal, calling it outside his authority. The debate highlights ongoing contention over immigration policy and the legal interpretation of the 14th Amendment. END OF SUMMARY.
