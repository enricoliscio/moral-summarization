SUMMARY: 
President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, sparking condemnation from Democrats and a mixed reaction from Republicans. Trump called the policy "controversial" and "ridiculous," stating that it encourages illegal immigration and is unfair to US citizens. The move was criticized by some as an overreach of executive power, with Speaker Paul Ryan stating that "you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order." Trump's announcement appeared to surprise some, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remained unsurprised, calling it "more of the same" from Trump. The president's attempt to end birthright citizenship by executive order is seen as a contentious move, with critics arguing it is unconstitutional and would require a constitutional amendment to change. The matter is expected to be settled by the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
