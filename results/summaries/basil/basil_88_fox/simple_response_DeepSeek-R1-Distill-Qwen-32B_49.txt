Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points and the moral arguments presented.

First, Trump is vowing to end birthright citizenship, citing the 14th Amendment and the cost to the country. He's considering an executive order, which is controversial. I should note the disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats.

Harry Reid's past comments are mentioned, which Trump uses to support his argument. Reid later apologized, but Trump still uses this to his advantage. I need to include that.

There's a debate about the 14th Amendment's intent and whether it applies to children of non-citizens. Critics argue it's a magnet for illegal immigration, while scholars say changing it would require a constitutional amendment.

Lawmakers are split. Ryan says it's clear and can't be done by executive order. Grassley and Graham are looking into legislation. Trump later says it might go to the Supreme Court.

Democrats are united against Trump, with Pelosi calling his remarks out of his authority.

I need to keep this under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the moral arguments. Make sure to include the main players and their stances, the legal arguments, and the political reactions.

Okay, putting it all together in a concise summary while highlighting the moral framing around fairness, cost, and the legal debate.

SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing it is unfair and costly, and claiming it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. He suggested using an executive order to achieve this, sparking disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Trump cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments opposing birthright citizenship, though Reid later apologized and reversed his stance. Trump argued that the U.S. is "the only country" offering citizenship to children of illegal immigrants, though scholars counter that changing the policy would require a constitutional amendment. Critics argue birthright citizenship encourages illegal immigration, while supporters emphasize the 14th Amendment's clarity. Lawmakers are divided: Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed the idea of ending it via executive order, while Sen. Lindsey Graham plans legislation. Trump later shifted, suggesting the Supreme Court might settle the issue. Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump's approach as overstepping his authority. END OF SUMMARY.
