SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship "one way or the other," arguing that the 14th Amendment does not cover children born to non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents. He cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments opposing the policy, despite Reid later reversing his stance. Trump suggested using an executive order to end birthright citizenship, but Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers argued that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. The announcement sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats, with some calling for legislative action instead. Trump later acknowledged that the matter will likely be settled by the Supreme Court. The debate over birthright citizenship has long been a contentious issue in the U.S., with critics arguing it encourages illegal immigration and is not intended to apply to children of non-citizens.
