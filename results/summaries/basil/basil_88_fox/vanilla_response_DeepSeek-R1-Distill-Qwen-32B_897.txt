Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship "one way or the other." He's considering an executive order, which has caused disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. He tweeted about the 14th Amendment, arguing that it doesn't cover birthright citizenship because of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." 

He also references Harry Reid, a former Senate Democratic Leader, who in 1993 criticized birthright citizenship but later apologized and changed his stance. Trump uses Reid's past comments to support his argument. 

Trump claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, though the article notes that Canada and some Latin American countries also have it. Critics say the 14th Amendment wasn't meant for children of non-citizens, especially illegal immigrants, and that it encourages illegal immigration. However, scholars argue that changing this would require a constitutional amendment.

Lawmakers have mixed reactions. Ryan says the 14th Amendment is clear and can't be changed by an executive order. Grassley will review the order but thinks Congress should handle it. Lindsey Graham is introducing legislation on the issue. Trump later said it would be settled by the Supreme Court, avoiding mention of an executive order.

Democrats are united against Trump's move. Pelosi criticized his lack of authority and the inconsistency with his past actions.

So, the main points are:
- Trump wants to end birthright citizenship.
- He considers using an executive order, which is controversial.
- He references the 14th Amendment and Harry Reid's past comments.
- Critics argue it's not intended for non-citizens, but scholars say it needs a constitutional change.
- Lawmakers are divided; some support legislation, others say it's Congress's role.
- Democrats condemn the move.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include Trump's vow, the executive order consideration, the 14th Amendment argument, Reid's comments, the debate over constitutional change, lawmakers' reactions, and Democratic opposition.

I should structure it to flow logically, perhaps starting with Trump's statement, then the reasons, reactions, and ending with the political implications.

SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing it's unfair and costly, and suggested using an executive order, though scholars say a constitutional amendment is needed. He cited the 14th Amendment, claiming it doesn't apply to non-citizens, and referenced former Senator Harry Reid's past criticism of the policy. Critics argue it encourages illegal immigration, while supporters say it's a constitutional right. Lawmakers are divided: some support legislation, while others, like Paul Ryan, oppose an executive order. Democrats condemn Trump's move, with Nancy Pelosi criticizing his overreach. The issue remains contentious, potentially heading to the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
