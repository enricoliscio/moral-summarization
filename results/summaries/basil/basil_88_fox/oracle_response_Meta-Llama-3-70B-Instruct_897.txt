SUMMARY:

President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it's "unfair" to US citizens and costs the country "billions of dollars." He tweeted that the policy, which grants citizenship to children of non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents born in the US, will be ended "one way or the other." Trump argued that the 14th Amendment doesn't cover birthright citizenship, citing the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also referenced a 1993 statement by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who said that "no sane country" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants.

Trump's push to end birthright citizenship has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats, who argue that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Critics of birthright citizenship claim it encourages "illegal immigration" and "crime," while many scholars counter that it's a constitutional right. The issue has long been a contentious one in the US, particularly for those seeking to "restrict" illegal immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
