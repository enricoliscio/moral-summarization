SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing that it is unfair to US citizens and costs the country billions. He cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments opposing the practice, claiming it rewards illegal immigrants with citizenship for their children. Trump suggested using an executive order to end birthright citizenship, drawing criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers argued that birthright citizenship is protected by the 14th Amendment and cannot be ended by executive order. The debate over birthright citizenship has long been contentious in the US, with critics arguing it encourages illegal immigration and should be restricted. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship by executive order was met with mixed reactions in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing it is an overreach of executive power. Democrats united in condemning Trump's move, calling it an overreach of his authority.
