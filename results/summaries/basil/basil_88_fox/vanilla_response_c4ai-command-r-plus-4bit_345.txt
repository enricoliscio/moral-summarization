SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship "one way or the other," referring to the practice of granting automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents. He argued that the 14th Amendment does not cover this practice and that it is costly and unfair to U.S. citizens. Trump's announcement sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. While some Republicans supported the idea, others disagreed with the use of an executive order to implement such a significant change. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, criticized Trump's move as being outside of his authority. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship by executive order faces legal and political challenges, with many scholars arguing that a constitutional amendment would be required to change the policy. The issue of birthright citizenship has long been a contentious one in the U.S., with critics arguing that it encourages illegal immigration and is not intended to apply to children of non-citizens.
