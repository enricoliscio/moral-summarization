SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, which grants citizenship to children born in the US to non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents. He claims it costs the country billions of dollars and is unfair to citizens. Trump cited a 1993 comment from former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who said no sane country would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but many scholars argue it would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans are divided on the issue, with some opposing the use of an executive order, while Democrats are united in condemnation. Trump has since shifted his stance, saying the matter will be settled by the Supreme Court. The 14th Amendment states that all persons born in the US are citizens, but critics argue it was never intended to apply to children of illegal immigrants.
