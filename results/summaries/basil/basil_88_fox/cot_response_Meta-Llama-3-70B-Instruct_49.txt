SUMMARY:
President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and "ridiculous" as it costs the country "billions of dollars". He claimed that the 14th Amendment does not cover birthright citizenship, citing the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof". Trump also took aim at Democrats, saying they went "insane" and promoted "open borders" which brings "massive crime". He referenced a 1993 comment by Harry Reid, who said that "no sane country" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump's push to end birthright citizenship has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats, with many arguing it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Trump appeared to shift his stance, saying the matter "will be settled by the United States Supreme Court". Democrats remain united in their condemnation of Trump's move, calling it an overreach of his authority. END OF SUMMARY.
