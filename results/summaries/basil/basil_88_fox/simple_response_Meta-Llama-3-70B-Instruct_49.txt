SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it is "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He cited a 1993 statement by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who argued that no sane country would grant citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump plans to use an executive order to end the practice, despite criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who argue that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Trump's move has sparked disagreement among Republicans, with some supporting his stance and others expressing concerns about the constitutionality of an executive order. Democrats have united in condemning Trump's move, arguing that it exceeds his authority and is a misguided attempt to restrict illegal immigration.

END OF SUMMARY.
