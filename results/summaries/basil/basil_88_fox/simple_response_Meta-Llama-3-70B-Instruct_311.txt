SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it is "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He argues that the 14th Amendment does not cover birthright citizenship due to the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." Trump's stance has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Some Republicans, like Speaker Paul Ryan, argue that the 14th Amendment is "pretty clear" and cannot be changed by executive order. Others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, plan to introduce legislation to address the issue. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have united in condemning Trump's move, stating that it exceeds his authority. The issue has long been contentious in the US, with critics arguing that birthright citizenship encourages illegal immigration and proponents countering that it would require a constitutional amendment to change.
