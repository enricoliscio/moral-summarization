SUMMARY:
President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it is "unfair" to US citizens and costs the country "billions of dollars". He argued that the 14th Amendment does not cover this policy, citing the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof". Trump also referenced a 1993 statement by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who called it "insane" to award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump's proposal was met with mixed reactions from Republicans, with some criticizing the use of an executive order, while others supported the move. Democrats, on the other hand, were united in their "condemnation" of the proposal, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling it an overreach of Trump's "authority". The issue is expected to be settled by the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
