SUMMARY: 
President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, stating that it is "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He claims that the policy is not covered by the 14th Amendment and has criticized it as "ridiculous", arguing that the US is the only country that offers citizenship to children born to non-citizens or illegal immigrants. This stance has been condemned by Democrats and has sparked disagreement among Republicans, with some blasting the idea of using an executive order to impose such a significant immigration change. The move has been labeled as "controversial", and some critics have argued that it was never intended to apply to children of two non-citizens, particularly those who have entered the country illegally. However, many scholars counter that altering the policy would require a constitutional amendment. The debate around birthright citizenship has long been a contentious issue in the US, with critics viewing it as a magnet for illegal immigration and an incentive for non-citizens to give birth on US soil. The President's announcement has been met with mixed reactions in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing that birthright citizenship is protected by the 14th Amendment and that any changes should be led by Congress, not an executive order.
