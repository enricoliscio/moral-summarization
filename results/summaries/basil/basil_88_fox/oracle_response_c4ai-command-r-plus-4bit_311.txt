SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and costly to the country. Trump's plan to use an executive order to end the practice sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. The President argued that the 14th Amendment does not cover birthright citizenship because of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also highlighted former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's past criticism of the policy, despite Reid's later reversal. Trump's move was met with mixed reactions in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing that an executive order is not the appropriate way to make such a significant change. The issue of birthright citizenship has long been contentious in the US, with critics saying it encourages illegal immigration and is not what the 14th Amendment intended. Supporters of the policy counter that it would take a constitutional amendment to change it. The debate centers around restricting illegal immigration and ending what some see as a reward for breaking the law.
