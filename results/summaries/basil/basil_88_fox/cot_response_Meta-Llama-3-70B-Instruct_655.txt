SUMMARY:
President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and "ridiculous" that children of illegal immigrants born in the US are automatically citizens. He cited the 14th Amendment, arguing that it doesn't apply to children of non-citizens, especially those who entered the country "illegally". Trump's push sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Even former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who once agreed with Trump's stance, later apologized and reversed his position. Critics argue that birthright citizenship encourages "illegal" immigration, while many scholars believe it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Trump's plan to use an executive order was met with a mixed reception, with some Republicans and Democrats alike calling it an overreach of authority. END OF SUMMARY.
