SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it is "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country billions. He argues that the 14th Amendment does not cover birthright citizenship due to the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The president's comments follow the emergence of his plan to terminate the policy via executive order, a proposal that has sparked moral debate among lawmakers. Former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's past criticism of birthright citizenship helped Trump make his case. However, many scholars argue that changing the policy would require a constitutional amendment. Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans disagree with Trump's plan, stating that birthright citizenship cannot be ended by executive order. Meanwhile, Democrats have united in condemnation of Trump's move, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dismissing the president's remarks as having "no relationship to what his authority is." Trump now acknowledges that the Supreme Court will likely settle the matter.
