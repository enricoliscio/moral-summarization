SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and claiming it costs the country billions of dollars. He argues that it is not covered by the 14th Amendment, which states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens." Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship by executive order has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. While some Republicans support the move, others argue that it is not within the president's authority to make such a change without a constitutional amendment. Democrats have united in their opposition to Trump's plan, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling it "more of the same" of Trump's controversial remarks on immigration. Trump's push to end birthright citizenship comes amid a broader effort to restrict illegal immigration and follows comments from former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who once called the practice of awarding citizenship to children of illegal immigrants "a reward." The move has also raised concerns about the potential impact on families and the broader implications for the country's immigration system.
