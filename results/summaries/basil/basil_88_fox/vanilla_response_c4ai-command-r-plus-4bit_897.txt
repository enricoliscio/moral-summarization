SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it costs the country billions and is unfair to citizens. He cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments opposing the policy, despite Reid later apologizing and reversing his stance. Trump suggested using an executive order to end birthright citizenship, arguing it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. The announcement was met with mixed reactions, with some Republicans disagreeing with the idea of using an executive order to make such a significant change. Others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, supported the move and announced plans to introduce legislation on the issue. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump's push, calling it another example of his anti-immigrant rhetoric. The president later acknowledged that the Supreme Court would ultimately settle the matter.
