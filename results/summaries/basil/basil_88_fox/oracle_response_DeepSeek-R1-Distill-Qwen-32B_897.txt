Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: unfair, ended, crime, entering, end, comes, restrict, immigration, come, introducing. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump wants to end birthright citizenship, arguing it's unfair and costs the country billions. He mentioned the 14th Amendment, saying it doesn't cover the children of illegal immigrants. He referenced Harry Reid's past comments to support his stance. Some Republicans are against using an executive order, while Democrats condemn the move.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's vow to end birthright citizenship, using the word "ended." I'll note it's unfair and costs billions. Then, I'll include his argument about the 14th Amendment and reference Reid's past stance on crime and entering the country illegally. I'll mention the mixed reactions from Republicans and Democrats, using "restrict" and "immigration." Finally, I'll add that Trump is considering an executive order but might have to go through the Supreme Court, and include Pelosi's criticism about his authority.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while using the specified moral words. I should avoid adding any new framing beyond what's in the article. Let me check the word count to stay under 200. I'll structure it in a few concise sentences, ensuring each main point is covered.

SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, calling it "unfair" and costly to the country. He argued that the 14th Amendment does not apply to children of non-citizens or illegal immigrants, referencing former Senate Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments on the "crime" of awarding citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Reid later reversed his stance, but Trump used his remarks to justify ending the policy. Trump suggested using an executive order, though many scholars argue it would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans were divided, with some opposing the use of an executive order, while Democrats condemned the move. Trump later shifted, stating the issue would likely be settled by the Supreme Court. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's overreach, emphasizing his lack of authority to end birthright citizenship. END OF SUMMARY.
