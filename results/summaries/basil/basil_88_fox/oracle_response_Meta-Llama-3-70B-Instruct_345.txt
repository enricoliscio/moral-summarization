SUMMARY:

President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it's "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country "billions of dollars." He argued that the 14th Amendment doesn't cover children of illegal immigrants, citing former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments that "no sane country" would award citizenship to such children. Trump believes the policy encourages "illegal immigration" and "crime." He wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but many scholars argue it would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans are divided, with some opposing the use of an executive order, while Democrats condemn the move as an overreach of authority. Trump's plan has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing it's necessary to "restrict" illegal immigration, while others see it as an attack on the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
