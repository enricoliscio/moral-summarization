SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, which grants citizenship to children born in the US to non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents. He claims that the policy costs the country billions of dollars and is unfair to citizens. Trump cited a 1993 comment by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who said that no sane country would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. However, Reid later apologized and reversed his stance. Trump's plan to use an executive order to end the practice has been met with mixed reactions from Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Many scholars argue that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. The 14th Amendment states that all persons born in the US are citizens, but critics argue that it was never intended to apply to children of illegal immigrants.
