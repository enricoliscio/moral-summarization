SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, which grants citizenship to children born in the US to non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents. He claims that the policy is unfair and costs the country billions of dollars. Trump cited a 1993 comment by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who said that no sane country would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but many scholars argue that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Republicans are divided on the issue, with some supporting Trump's move and others, like Speaker Paul Ryan, saying that an executive order cannot end birthright citizenship. Democrats have condemned Trump's move, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi saying it has no relationship to his authority.
