SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, stating that it costs the country billions of dollars and is unfair to citizens. He cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments opposing the policy, but faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. While Trump suggested using an executive order, Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers argued that it would require a constitutional amendment. The 14th Amendment grants citizenship to those born or naturalized in the U.S., but critics argue it was not intended for children of non-citizens or illegal immigrants. The issue has sparked debate over illegal immigration and the encouragement of birth tourism. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham support addressing the issue, while Democrats have condemned Trump's move as unconstitutional. Trump acknowledged that the Supreme Court will likely settle the matter.
END OF SUMMARY.
