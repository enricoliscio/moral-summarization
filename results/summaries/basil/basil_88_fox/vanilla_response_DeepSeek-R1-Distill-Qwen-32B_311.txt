Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, mentioning he might do it via executive order. That caused disagreements among Republicans and criticism from Democrats. He tweeted about the 14th Amendment, specifically the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof," which he believes doesn't cover the children of non-citizens. He also referenced Harry Reid's old comments from 1993, where Reid opposed birthright citizenship, but later changed his stance.

Trump claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, though the article notes Canada and some Latin American countries also have it. Critics argue the 14th Amendment wasn't meant to include children of non-citizens, especially illegal immigrants, and that it encourages illegal immigration. However, scholars say changing this would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive order.

In Congress, some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, say the 14th Amendment is clear and can't be changed by executive order. Others, like Lindsey Graham, plan to introduce legislation. Trump later said the Supreme Court would settle it, avoiding mention of using an executive order. Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, condemned his approach, saying it's beyond his authority.

So, the key points are:
- Trump wants to end birthright citizenship.
- He suggested using an executive order, which is controversial.
- The 14th Amendment's wording is a point of debate.
- Some Republicans support legislative action, while others oppose executive orders.
- Democrats criticize his approach as unconstitutional.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on Trump's vow, the methods considered, the legal debate, Republican reactions, and Democratic opposition. I should make sure to mention the 14th Amendment, the argument about jurisdiction, the reference to Harry Reid, and the congressional responses. Also, note that Trump later deferred to the Supreme Court and that Democrats are against it.

I should structure it in a logical flow: Trump's statement, the legal argument, reference to Reid, Republican and Democratic reactions, and the potential for Supreme Court involvement. Keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.
