SUMMARY:

President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it's "very unfair" to US citizens and costs the country "billions of dollars." He tweeted that the policy, which grants citizenship to children of non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents born in the US, will be ended "one way or the other." Trump argued that the 14th Amendment doesn't cover birthright citizenship due to the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's 1993 comments, where Reid called it "insane" to award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants.

Trump's push sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats, with many arguing that ending birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment. Critics claim the policy encourages illegal immigration, while supporters argue it's a fundamental right. Trump later shifted his stance, saying the issue would be settled by the Supreme Court.
