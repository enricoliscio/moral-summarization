SUMMARY:

President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, which he deemed "unfair" to US citizens, claiming it costs the country "billions of dollars." He argued that the 14th Amendment does not cover this policy, citing the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." Trump also referenced a 1993 statement by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who said that no sane country would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but critics argue it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Many Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, expressed concerns about Trump's plan, while Democrats condemned it. Trump later shifted his stance, saying the matter "will be settled by the United States Supreme Court." The issue has sparked a contentious debate, with some arguing that birthright citizenship encourages "illegal immigration" and others seeing it as a fundamental right.
