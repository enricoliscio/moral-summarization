SUMMARY: 
President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, a move that has sparked moral controversy and condemnation from Democrats. The President has called the policy "ridiculous" and a "reward" for illegal immigrants, arguing that it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. He has cited former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who in 1993, called the policy "insane" and promoted legislation to end it. Trump's push to end birthright citizenship by executive order has been criticized by some Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argue that it is not within the President's authority to make such a change unilaterally. Others, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, have announced they will introduce legislation to address the issue. Democrats have united in their condemnation of Trump's move, calling it a continuation of his controversial and restrictive immigration agenda. The President, however, remains steadfast, shifting his stance to acknowledge that the matter will ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
