SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it is "very unfair" to American citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He cited a 1993 quote from former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who argued that no sane country would grant citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on its soil. Trump believes the 14th Amendment does not cover birthright citizenship due to the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." However, critics argue that the amendment was intended to apply to all persons born in the US, regardless of their parents' citizenship status. Many scholars believe it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Republicans are divided on the issue, with some opposing the use of an executive order to impose such a significant change, while Democrats are united in their condemnation of Trump's move.
