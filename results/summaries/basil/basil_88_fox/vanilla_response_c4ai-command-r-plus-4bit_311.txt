SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it costs the US billions and is unfair to citizens. He cited comments from former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who once opposed the policy, and argued it encourages illegal immigration. Trump suggested using an executive order to end the practice, but Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers disagreed, stating that it would require a constitutional amendment. The announcement sparked debate among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats, with some calling for legislative action instead. Trump later acknowledged the matter would be settled by the Supreme Court. Critics argue that birthright citizenship was never intended to apply to children of non-citizens, while scholars counter that an executive order would not be sufficient to change the policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
