SUMMARY:
President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, a policy he deemed "unfair" and "ridiculous," claiming it costs the country "billions of dollars." He cited a 1993 comment from former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who called it "insane" to award citizenship to children of "illegal immigrants." Trump wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but many lawmakers, including Republicans, disagree, saying it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Democrats condemned the move, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling it "more of the same" from Trump. Critics argue that birthright citizenship "encourages" illegal immigration, while supporters say it would take a Supreme Court ruling to settle the issue. Trump appears to be shifting his stance, acknowledging the matter "will be settled by the United States Supreme Court." END OF SUMMARY.
