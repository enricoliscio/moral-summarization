Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

President Trump is vowing to end birthright citizenship, which he claims costs the country billions and is unfair. He's considering an executive order, which has caused disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. He references the 14th Amendment, saying it's not covered because of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also brings up Harry Reid's past comments to support his argument.

The article mentions that the U.S. isn't the only country with birthright citizenship, but it's a contentious issue, especially for those against illegal immigration. Critics argue the 14th Amendment wasn't meant to apply to children of non-citizens, especially illegal immigrants. They believe it encourages people to come illegally. However, scholars say changing this would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive order.

Lawmakers are mixed. Ryan says the amendment is clear and can't be changed by an executive order. Grassley will review the proposed order but thinks Congress should lead. Graham is introducing legislation. Trump later shifts, saying it might be settled by the Supreme Court. Democrats are united against him, with Pelosi criticizing his lack of authority.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The author presents Trump's argument as controversial, with support from Reid's past stance, and the counterarguments from scholars and lawmakers. The moral framing includes the fairness, cost, and legal arguments. I should make sure to include Trump's claims, the opposition, and the legal implications.

I'll structure the summary to first state Trump's vow, his reasoning, mention Reid, then the counterarguments, the lawmakers' reactions, and the Democrats' opposition. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspects are clear.
