SUMMARY: 
President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, a move that has been met with criticism and condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats. The President argues that birthright citizenship is "very unfair" to US citizens and that it encourages illegal immigration by "rewarding" children of illegal immigrants with citizenship. Trump's plan to end the practice with an executive order has been criticized by some lawmakers, who argue that it is unconstitutional and beyond the scope of executive power. Speaker Paul Ryan stated that "you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order," while Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley acknowledged that Congress should take the lead in debating and carefully considering any changes to the current policy. Despite the controversy, Trump maintains that birthright citizenship will be "settled by the United States Supreme Court." Democrats have united in their condemnation of Trump's plan, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stating that his remarks on immigration are "more of the same." The President's attempt to unilaterally change immigration policy has sparked concerns about the ethics of unilaterally changing the law without congressional input, as well as the moral implications of denying citizenship to children born in the US to non-citizen parents.
