Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Trump vowing to end birthright citizenship. He mentioned the 14th Amendment, saying it's not covered because of the jurisdiction clause. He also referenced Harry Reid's past comments, which Reid later apologized for. Trump wants to use an executive order, but some Republicans and Democrats disagree. Scholars say it would need a constitutional amendment. Trump later said it would be settled by the Supreme Court. Pelosi condemns him, and some Republicans are introducing legislation.

I should highlight Trump's stance, his reasoning, the reactions from both parties, and the legal implications. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clearâ€”like the fairness and costs he mentions, and the criticism from Democrats about it being unconstitutional.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's vow, mention the 14th Amendment argument, reference Reid's past comments, his plan to use an executive order, reactions from Ryan and Grassley, the counterarguments from scholars, Trump's shift to the Supreme Court, Pelosi's condemnation, and Graham's legislation. Keep each point concise.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details but capture the main points and the moral arguments on both sides. Make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, arguing it is unfair and costly, and claiming it is not covered by the 14th Amendment. He criticized the practice, comparing it to offering a reward for illegal immigration, and referenced former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's past comments opposing birthright citizenship, though Reid later reversed his stance. Trump suggested using an executive order to end the policy, but faced criticism from Republicans like Paul Ryan, who argued the 14th Amendment is "pretty clear" and cannot be changed via executive order. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said he would review the proposal but emphasized Congress's role in addressing the issue. Trump later shifted his stance, stating the matter would be settled by the Supreme Court. Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, condemned the move, with Pelosi calling it an overreach of authority. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham announced plans to introduce legislation targeting birthright citizenship, framing it as a "magnet for illegal immigration." Critics argue the policy encourages illegal immigration, while scholars counter that changing it would require a constitutional amendment. END OF SUMMARY.
