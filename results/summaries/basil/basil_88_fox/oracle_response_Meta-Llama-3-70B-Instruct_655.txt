SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, claiming it is "unfair" to US citizens and costs the country "billions of dollars." He argues that the 14th Amendment does not cover birthright citizenship, citing the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." Trump also referenced comments made by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid in 1993, who said that awarding citizenship to children of illegal immigrants was not a practice a "sane country" would follow. Trump's push to end birthright citizenship has sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats, with many arguing that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Critics of birthright citizenship claim it encourages "illegal immigration" and "crime," while others argue it is a fundamental right. Trump's announcement has been met with a mixed reception, with some lawmakers expressing concerns over his proposed use of an executive order to impose such a significant immigration change.
