Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

First, Trump tweeted that birthright citizenship will end "one way or the other," referencing the 14th Amendment and saying it's not covered because of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also mentioned Harry Reid's past comments from 1993, where Reid opposed birthright citizenship but later changed his stance. Trump is considering an executive order to end the practice, but there's opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.

The article mentions that the U.S. isn't the only country with birthright citizenship, but it's a contentious issue here, especially for those against illegal immigration. Critics argue the 14th Amendment wasn't meant to apply to children of non-citizens, especially illegal immigrants, and that the policy encourages illegal immigration. However, scholars say changing this would require a constitutional amendment.

Lawmakers have mixed reactions. Paul Ryan says the 14th Amendment is clear and can't be changed by an executive order. Lindsey Graham is introducing legislation to address the issue. Trump later said it might be settled by the Supreme Court, avoiding mention of an executive order. Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, condemn his move, saying it's beyond his authority.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's vow, his reference to the 14th Amendment, the mention of Harry Reid, the opposition from both parties, the legal implications, and the mixed reactions from Congress.

Wait, I should also note that the U.S. isn't the only country with this policy, but it's a hot topic here. And the fact that Trump's initial plan was to use an executive order but then shifted to the Supreme Court.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's vow, mention the 14th Amendment, reference Reid, then the opposition, the legal challenges, and the mixed reactions in Congress, ending with Democratic condemnation.

I think that's all the key points. Now, I'll write the summary making sure it's concise and under 200 words.
