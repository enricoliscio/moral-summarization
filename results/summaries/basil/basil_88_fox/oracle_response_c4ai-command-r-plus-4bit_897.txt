SUMMARY: President Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, a move that sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. Trump argued that birthright citizenship is unfair to US citizens and costs the country billions of dollars. He took aim at former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who once said that "no sane country" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump's push to end birthright citizenship by executive order was met with mixed reactions in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing that it would require a constitutional amendment or legislative action. The move was condemned by Democrats, who saw it as another example of Trump's controversial immigration agenda. The President's attempt to end birthright citizenship is an attempt to restrict illegal immigration and send a message that entering the country illegally will not be rewarded.
END OF SUMMARY.
