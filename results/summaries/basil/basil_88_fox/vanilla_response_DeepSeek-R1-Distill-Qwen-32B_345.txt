Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's stance on birthright citizenship. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

First, Trump tweeted about ending birthright citizenship, citing the 14th Amendment and arguing it's not covered because of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also referenced Harry Reid's old comments to support his argument. I should note that Reid later changed his stance, which might be relevant.

The article mentions that Trump initially considered using an executive order, which caused disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. I should highlight the mixed reactions in Congress, especially from Ryan and Grassley, who question Trump's authority to use an executive order. Also, Lindsey Graham is introducing legislation, which shows another approach.

It's important to mention that the U.S. isn't the only country with birthright citizenship, but it's a contentious issue here. Critics argue that it's a magnet for illegal immigration, while scholars say changing the policy would require a constitutional amendment.

I should also include Democrats' reactions, with Pelosi calling Trump's move typical and not surprising. Finally, Trump shifted his stance slightly, saying it might be settled by the Supreme Court.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include Trump's vow, his reasoning, the reactions from both parties, the legal implications, and the shift in stance. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
