SUMMARY:
President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, a move that has been met with criticism and condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats. Trump argues that birthright citizenship is "ridiculous" and "very unfair" to US citizens, citing the 14th Amendment as not covering it due to the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." He also brought up former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's past comments from 1993, where he called the policy "insane." The President's plan to use an executive order to end birthright citizenship has been criticized by Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers, who argue that such a significant change to immigration policy should be led by Congress. Democrats have united in their condemnation of Trump's move, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling it "more of the same" of his controversial remarks on immigration. The President's announcement has sparked a debate on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and the role of the executive branch in making immigration policy changes. The move has also raised concerns about the potential impact on families and the encouragement of illegal immigration.
