SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, which grants citizenship to children born in the US to non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents. Trump claims that the 14th Amendment does not cover this policy and that it costs the country billions of dollars. He cited a 1993 statement by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who argued that no sane country would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. Trump wants to use an executive order to end the practice, but many scholars argue that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Republicans are divided on the issue, with some criticizing Trump's plan and others supporting it. Democrats have condemned the move, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi saying it exceeds Trump's authority. The issue is likely to be settled by the Supreme Court.
