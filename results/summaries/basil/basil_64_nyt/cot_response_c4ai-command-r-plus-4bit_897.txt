SUMMARY:
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate." Trump suggested that Ginsburg's comments were a disgrace to the Supreme Court and that she should apologize. He found it appalling that a member of the high court would involve herself in a political campaign. Ginsburg had expressed her fear of a Trump presidency, stating she couldn't imagine the country under his leadership. Trump's remarks came as he was narrowing down his choice for a running mate, a decision he described as largely instinctual. He praised the candidates he was considering, including Governor Christie, calling them "strong," "excellent," and "solid." Trump also mentioned that he expected to announce his vice-presidential pick within a few days. He believed that his selection would be well-received by many people. Trump's criticism of Ginsburg highlighted the importance he placed on the moral appropriateness of public statements made by those in high offices.
