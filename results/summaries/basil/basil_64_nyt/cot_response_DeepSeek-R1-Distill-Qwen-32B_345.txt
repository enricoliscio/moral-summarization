Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her comments about his candidacy. She expressed fear about the country if he were elected, which Trump found inappropriate. He called her remarks a disgrace and suggested she should apologize. He also mentioned wanting her to leave the court soon, which seems harsh.

Next, the article moves on to Trump's plans for selecting a running mate. He mentions having several candidates, including known figures like Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. He emphasizes that his decision is based on instinct and experience rather than fundraising ability.

I need to identify the morally framed words. From the article, words like "disdainful," "highly inappropriate," "disgrace," "energizes," "solid," "terrific," "patriot," "excellent," and "gut" stand out. These words carry moral connotations, either positive or negative, in the context of the discussion.

Now, for the summary, I should include these words where appropriate. I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments, his reaction, and his running mate selection process. I'll make sure to use the identified moral terms to maintain the original framing.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first address Trump's criticism, then his comments on the running mate, ensuring that the moral language is preserved throughout.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each paragraph isn't too long and that the key points are covered with the right moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.
