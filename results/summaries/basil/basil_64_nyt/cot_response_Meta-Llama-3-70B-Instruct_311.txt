SUMMARY:
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "disdainful" remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace" to the Supreme Court. Trump suggested that Ginsburg owed the other justices an apology and even hinted that she should step down from the court as soon as possible. Trump's comments came in response to Ginsburg's statement that she was "frightened" about the prospect of Trump as president. Meanwhile, Trump revealed that he is close to announcing his running mate, saying that his decision will be based on instinct and that he has a "gut" feeling about the candidates. Trump praised several potential running mates, including Gov. Chris Christie, who was "excellent" in his audition, and Newt Gingrich, who is a "good guy." Trump expressed confidence that his choice will be a "very good decision" for many people.
