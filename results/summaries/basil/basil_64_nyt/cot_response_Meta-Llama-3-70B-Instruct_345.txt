SUMMARY:
Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "disdainful" remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace" to the court. Trump suggested that Justice Ginsburg owed the other justices an apology and even implied that she should step down from the court as soon as possible. In an interview, Justice Ginsburg had expressed her fears about what the country would be like with Trump as president, saying she couldn't imagine it. Trump, on the other hand, defended his candidacy, saying that Justice Ginsburg's comments only "energized" his base. Meanwhile, Trump also discussed his search for a running mate, saying that his decision would be based on instinct and that he had a few "strong" and "excellent" candidates in mind. END OF SUMMARY.
