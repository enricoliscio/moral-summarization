SUMMARY: Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owed the other justices an apology for involving herself in politics. Ginsburg's joke about moving to New Zealand if Trump were elected did not sit well with Trump, who found her comments unbefitting of a Supreme Court member. Trump suggested that Ginsburg's comments were a disgrace to the court and that she should step down from her position as soon as possible. He also shared an update on his vice-presidential selection process, indicating that he would be announcing his decision in the coming days and emphasizing the importance of his gut instinct in the decision-making process. Trump mentioned several candidates he is considering, including Governor Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Governor Mike Pence, and others. He described them with words like "strong," "patriot," "exciting," and "solid."
END OF SUMMARY.
