SUMMARY:
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "disdainful" remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and "unbefitting" a Supreme Court justice. Trump suggested that Ginsburg owed an apology to the court and even implied that she should step down. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the country would look like if Trump were elected, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her comments a "disgrace" and said they only "energize" his base. Meanwhile, Trump discussed his search for a running mate, saying his decision would be based on "gut" and praising candidates like Gov. Chris Christie, who was "excellent", and Gov. Mike Pence, who is "solid as a rock". Trump also expressed confidence in his ability to win traditionally Democratic states like Connecticut. END OF SUMMARY.
