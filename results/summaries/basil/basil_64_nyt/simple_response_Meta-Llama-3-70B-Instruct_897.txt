SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, slammed Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and demanding an apology from her to the court. Trump's outrage stems from Ginsburg's comments, where she expressed fear about the nation's future if Trump were elected, even joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump believes a Supreme Court judge should not get involved in a political campaign, and Ginsburg's statements are "beneath the court." Meanwhile, Trump is set to announce his running mate by Friday, with five candidates in the running, and is relying on his instincts to make the decision. He also hinted at considering polling in Democratic states like Connecticut, which he believes he can win in November.

END OF SUMMARY.
