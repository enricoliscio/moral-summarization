SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes an apology to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the nation would look like if Trump were elected, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump said a Supreme Court judge should not get involved in a political campaign, and her comments only energize his base. Meanwhile, Trump announced he would reveal his running mate by Friday, choosing from a list of five known and two unknown candidates. He emphasized that his decision would be based on instinct, not fundraising prowess. Trump also mentioned he would consider polling in Democratic states like Connecticut, believing he could put them in play in November. He briefly commented on his potential running mates, describing them as "strong," "a patriot," "terrific," "solid as a rock," and "a good guy."
