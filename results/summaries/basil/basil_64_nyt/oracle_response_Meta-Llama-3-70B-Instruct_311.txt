SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "disdainful" remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owed an apology to the court. Trump deemed it "unbefitting" for a Supreme Court judge to get "involved" in a political campaign. He stated that her comments were a "disgrace" to the court and only served to "energize" his base. Trump also announced that he would be selecting a running mate soon, with a decision expected by Friday. He mentioned that his choice would be based on instinct, rather than fundraising prowess. Trump praised several potential candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Gov. Mike Pence, using morally framed language to describe them as "strong", "a patriot", and "solid as a rock", respectively.
