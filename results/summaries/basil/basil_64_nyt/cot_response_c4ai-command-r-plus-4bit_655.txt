SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes the other justices an apology. Ginsburg expressed her fear of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump deemed her comments as a disgrace to the Supreme Court and asserted that they would only energize his base further. He also provided an update on his vice-presidential selection process, stating that he has five known candidates and two unknown ones, and that his decision will be based on his instinct and the candidates' strengths. He described the candidates, including Governor Christie, General Flynn, Senator Ernst, Governor Pence, and Newt Gingrich, using morally framed words like "strong," "excellent," "solid," and "good." Trump believes he can put even heavily Democratic states like Connecticut in play in the November election.
