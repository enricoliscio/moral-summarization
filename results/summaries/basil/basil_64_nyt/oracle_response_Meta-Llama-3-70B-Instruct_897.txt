SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "unbefitting" comments about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owed the Supreme Court an apology. Trump claimed that Ginsburg's remarks, in which she expressed fear about the nation's future under his presidency, were a "disgrace to the court". He argued that a Supreme Court judge should not be "involved" in a political campaign, and that her statements only served to energize his base. Trump also announced that he would be selecting a running mate by Friday, citing his trust in his instincts and familiarity with the candidates. He praised several potential candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Gov. Mike Pence, using morally charged language such as "strong", "patriot", and "solid as a rock".
