Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's response to Justice Ginsburg's comments. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article starts with Trump criticizing Ginsburg for her remarks about him being elected. She expressed fear about the country's future if he becomes president and even joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her comments "highly inappropriate" and suggested she should apologize to the court. He also implied she should step down.

Then, the article shifts to Trump's vice presidential selection. He's considering several candidates, including Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Mike Pence, Joni Ernst, and Mike Flynn. He mentioned he's making a decision soon, based on instinct rather than fundraising ability.

I should include the main points: Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments, his suggestion for her to apologize, and his vice presidential selection process with the candidates mentioned.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows well. Let me structure it: start with Trump's criticism, mention Ginsburg's comments, then move to his VP selection, listing the candidates briefly.

I should avoid any extra details to keep it concise. Make sure to use clear and direct language without markdown, just plain text.
