Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words "unbefitting" and "involved." Let me read through the article again to understand the context.

The article discusses Trump's criticism of Justice Ginsburg for her political comments. He called her remarks "unbefitting" and suggested she should apologize. The key points are Trump's disapproval of her involvement in the political campaign, his expectation to choose a running mate soon, and his evaluation of potential candidates.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's main criticisms, the specific terms, and the running mate selection process. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Also, I should ensure that the moral framing words are included as per the user's request.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate "unbefitting" and "involved." I'll mention Trump's criticism, Ginsburg's comments, his expectation of an apology, and his running mate selection process, including the candidates he's considering. I'll keep the language clear and direct, sticking to the main points without adding extra details.

I think that covers all the requirements. Let me put it together now.
