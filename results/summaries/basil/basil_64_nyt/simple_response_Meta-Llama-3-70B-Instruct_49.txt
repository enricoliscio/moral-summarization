SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and demanding an apology from her to the court. Trump's response is morally questionable, as it attempts to silence a respected justice's legitimate concerns about his fitness for office. Justice Ginsburg's comments, on the other hand, demonstrate her commitment to the well-being of the nation and the integrity of the Supreme Court. Trump's reaction also reveals his own lack of respect for the judiciary and his tendency to personalize criticisms. Meanwhile, Trump discussed his search for a running mate, citing his "gut instinct" as a key factor in his decision. He praised several potential candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Gov. Mike Pence. Overall, Trump's behavior in this episode raises concerns about his ability to respect the independence of the judiciary and his fitness for the presidency.
