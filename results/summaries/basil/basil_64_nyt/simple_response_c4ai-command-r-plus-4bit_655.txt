SUMMARY: Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for President of the United States, launched a scathing attack on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling her comments about his candidacy "highly inappropriate" and demanding an apology to the other justices. Ginsburg had expressed her fear of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand if he were elected. Trump's remarks questioned the morality of Ginsburg's conduct, suggesting that her political statements were beneath the dignity of the Supreme Court and a disgrace to the institution. He argued that her comments were unbefitting of a member of the nation's highest court and that she should step down from her position as soon as possible. Trump's criticism highlights a tension between political expression and judicial impartiality, with Trump emphasizing the importance of maintaining the integrity and non-partisanship of the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
