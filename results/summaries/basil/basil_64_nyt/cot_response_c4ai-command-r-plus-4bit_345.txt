SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, deeming them inappropriate and a disgrace to the Supreme Court. Trump suggested that Ginsburg should apologize and step down from the court. Ginsburg's comments, expressing fear of a Trump presidency and joking about moving to New Zealand, have energized Trump's base. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to announce his running mate soon, with a decision coming down to his gut feeling. The candidates under consideration include Governor Chris Christie, described as strong; retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, a patriot; Senator Joni Ernst, a terrific and exciting person; Governor Mike Pence, solid as a rock; and Newt Gingrich, a good guy. Trump's remarks highlight a breach of political neutrality expected of Supreme Court justices and bring attention to the potential influence of the court's composition on the nation's future.
