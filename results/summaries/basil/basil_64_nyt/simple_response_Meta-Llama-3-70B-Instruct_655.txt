SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and demanding an apology. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the nation would look like if Trump were elected, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump saw her comments as unbefitting a Supreme Court judge, claiming they "energize" his base and calling for her to step down. This exchange highlights the blurred lines between politics and the judiciary, with Trump accusing Ginsburg of being partisan and Ginsburg exercising her right to free speech. Trump's reaction raises concerns about his respect for the independence of the judiciary and the norms of democratic institutions.
