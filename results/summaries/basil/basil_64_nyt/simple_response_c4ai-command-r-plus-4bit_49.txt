SUMMARY: Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, sharply criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her recent comments expressing fear and disdain about his candidacy. Trump called Ginsburg's remarks "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace to the court," suggesting that she should apologize and step down from her position. Ginsburg, in an interview, had expressed her dread of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand if he were elected. Trump's response to Ginsburg's comments came during an interview with The Times, in which he also discussed his ongoing search for a running mate. He stated that he would be announcing his choice of vice president within the next few days and that his decision would be largely based on instinct. Trump criticized Ginsburg's breach of ethical decorum, arguing that her remarks were unbefitting of a member of the nation's highest court. He suggested that her comments would only serve to energize his base further. Trump's criticism of Ginsburg highlights his disregard for the traditional boundaries between politics and the judiciary, as well as his willingness to attack those who criticize him, even when they hold positions that are meant to be apolitical.
END OF SUMMARY.
