SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has lashed out at Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling her comments about his candidacy "highly inappropriate" and demanding an apology. Justice Ginsburg had expressed her fear about the country's future if Trump were elected, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump deemed her remarks unbefitting a Supreme Court judge, saying they were a "disgrace to the court" and only served to energize his base. This incident highlights the importance of maintaining the impartiality and dignity of the judiciary, which Trump's criticism of Justice Ginsburg undermines. Trump's response also reveals his own lack of respect for the institution and its members. Meanwhile, Trump announced that he would soon be selecting a running mate, with a decision expected by Friday.

END OF SUMMARY.
