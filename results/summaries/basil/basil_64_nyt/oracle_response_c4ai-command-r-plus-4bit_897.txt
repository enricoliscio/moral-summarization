SUMMARY: Donald Trump has criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her involvement in the presidential race, calling her comments about his candidacy "highly inappropriate" and suggesting that they are unbefitting of a member of the Supreme Court. In an interview with The Times, Ginsburg expressed her fear about the prospect of a Trump presidency, stating that she couldn't imagine the country with him as president and joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, suggested that Ginsburg's remarks were a disgrace to the court and that she should apologize and step down from her position. He also provided insight into his vice-presidential selection process, stating that it would largely come down to his gut feeling about the candidates. Trump is considering five known candidates, including Governor Chris Christie, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Senator Joni Ernst, Governor Mike Pence, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. He plans to announce his decision by Friday.
