Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and specified the morally framed words to keep, which are "unbefitting" and "involved." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump criticized Justice Ginsburg for her political comments, calling it inappropriate. She expressed concern about Trump becoming president. Trump also talked about choosing a running mate, mentioning several candidates and his selection process based on instinct.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's criticism, using "unbefitting" and "involved." I'll mention Ginsburg's concerns and Trump's reaction. Then, I'll move on to his running mate selection, noting the candidates and his instinct-based approach.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check that the morally framed words are present and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her political remarks, calling them "unbefitting" and suggesting she owed the court an apology. Ginsburg had expressed concern about Trump's potential presidency, stating she couldn't imagine the country under his leadership. Trump condemned her involvement in the political campaign, deeming it inappropriate and a disgrace to the court. He also hinted at her stepping down soon. Trump discussed his vice-presidential selection process, emphasizing instinct and experience over fundraising, and praised candidates like Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. He remained tight-lipped on the final decision but indicated it would be made soon. END OF SUMMARY.
