SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to comments made by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg about his presidential campaign, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting that she owed the other justices an apology for getting involved in political campaigns. Ginsburg had expressed her fear of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand if he were elected. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, stated that Ginsburg's comments were unbefitting of a member of the high court and brought disgrace to the court. He suggested that Ginsburg should step down from her position as soon as possible. Trump also provided an update on his vice-presidential selection process, stating that he would be making a decision within the next few days and that his choice would be based on his instinct and experience with the candidates. He described the candidates he was considering, including Governor Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Governor Mike Pence, and others, highlighting their strengths and his positive relationships with them.
END OF SUMMARY.
