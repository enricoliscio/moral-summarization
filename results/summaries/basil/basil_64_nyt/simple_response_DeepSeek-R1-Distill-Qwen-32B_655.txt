Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her comments about his candidacy. She expressed fear about the country if he becomes president and even joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggested she should apologize. He also mentioned that her comments energized his base and hoped she would step down from the court.

Additionally, the article talks about Trump's process of selecting a running mate. He has a few candidates, including Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich, and he's basing his decision on instinct rather than fundraising potential. He also mentioned considering polling in states like Connecticut.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words and preserves the moral framing. The original article presents Trump's criticism as inappropriate and possibly setting a bad precedent, so I should highlight that aspect.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments, his reaction, and the implications on the court's neutrality. Then, mention the running mate selection briefly.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, captures the key points, and maintains the moral perspective that Trump's actions might undermine the court's impartiality.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all necessary elements without being too detailed.
