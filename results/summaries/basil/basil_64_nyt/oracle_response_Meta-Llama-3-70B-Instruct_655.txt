SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "unbefitting" comments about his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes an apology to the court. Trump found it "disgraceful" that a Supreme Court judge would get "involved" in a political campaign, saying it "beneath the court" for her to make such statements. He even went so far as to say she should step down from the court as soon as possible. Trump's comments came in response to Justice Ginsburg's statement that she was "frightened" about the prospect of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand if he were elected. Trump also discussed his search for a running mate, saying he would make a decision soon and that it would be based on his "gut" instinct.

END OF SUMMARY.
