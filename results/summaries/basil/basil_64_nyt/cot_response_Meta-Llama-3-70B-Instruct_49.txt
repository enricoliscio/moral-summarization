SUMMARY:
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "disdainful" remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes the other justices an apology. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the nation would look like with Trump as president, saying it would be a "disgrace" to the court. Trump found her comments "unbefitting" a Supreme Court judge and said they only "energize" his base. Meanwhile, Trump discussed his search for a running mate, saying his decision would be based on "gut" and praising potential candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, who was "excellent", and Newt Gingrich, who is a "good guy". Trump also suggested he could put heavily Democratic states like Connecticut in play in November. END OF SUMMARY.
