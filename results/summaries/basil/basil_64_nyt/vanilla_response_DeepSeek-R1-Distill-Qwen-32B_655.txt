Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's response to Justice Ginsburg's comments. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump criticized Justice Ginsburg for her remarks about the presidential race. She was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the country would look like if Trump were elected. She even joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggested she should apologize to the court. He also mentioned that her comments energized his base and hoped she would step down soon.

Then, the article shifts to Trump's plans for choosing a running mate. He said he has five candidates plus two unknown ones and expects to announce his decision by Friday. He mentioned that his choice isn't based on fundraising but on experience and instinct. He specifically praised Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich, and also mentioned Mike Pence, whose support has risen among his advisers. He added that he considers gut feeling a lot in his decision-making.

So, the main points are:
1. Trump criticizes Ginsburg for her political comments, calling it inappropriate and suggesting she should apologize.
2. Trump mentions his running mate selection process, with several candidates and a focus on instinct and experience over fundraising.
3. He praised specific candidates like Christie, Gingrich, and Pence.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, then move to his running mate selection, highlighting the candidates and his criteria. I'll make sure to include that he finds her comments inappropriate and that he's focusing on instinct in choosing his VP.

Wait, I should also mention that Ginsburg was interviewed by The Times and made those remarks. Maybe include that she was frightened about Trump's election. Also, Trump said her comments energized his base, which is an interesting point to include.

I need to keep it concise but cover all the key elements. Let me structure it: start with Trump's criticism, then her comments, his reaction, then his VP selection process, the candidates, and his criteria. Make sure it's all within 200 words.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.
