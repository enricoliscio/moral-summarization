Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Justice Ginsburg. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg for her comments about him being elected president. She said she was frightened about what the country would look like if he became president and even joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggested she should apologize to the court. He also mentioned that her comments only energized his base more and hoped she would step down soon.

Next, the article talks about Trump's plans for choosing a running mate. He mentioned having five known candidates and two unknown ones. He said he would make a decision within three to four days and that his choice was based more on instinct than fundraising potential. He specifically mentioned Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich as strong candidates, and also mentioned Mike Pence, whose standing has risen among his advisers. He briefly commented on other potential candidates like Joni Ernst and Mike Flynn, calling them strong or patriotic.

So, the key points are:
1. Trump criticizes Ginsburg for her political comments, calling it inappropriate and hoping she resigns.
2. Trump is in the process of selecting a running mate, considering several candidates, and his decision is based on instinct.
3. He dismisses the idea of choosing based on fundraising and mentions specific candidates like Christie, Gingrich, Pence, etc.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, his comments on the inappropriateness of a justice making political statements, his hope for her resignation, and his running mate selection process, mentioning the candidates and his criteria.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, then move to his running mate selection, and wrap up with his criteria and candidates. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I think that covers the main points without going into too much detail. I should avoid any unnecessary information and focus on the key actions and statements from Trump.
