Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg for her comments on the election. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing, specifically using the words "unbefitting" and "involved." 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is upset because Ginsburg spoke out against his candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she should apologize. Ginsburg expressed fears about the country under Trump, even joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump thinks it's inappropriate for a Supreme Court justice to get involved in politics and wants her to step down. He also mentions his vice-presidential selection process, considering several candidates and relying on gut instinct.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the morally charged words "unbefitting" and "involved." I need to make sure these words are present. I should condense the article, focusing on Trump's criticism, Ginsburg's comments, his thoughts on her involvement, and his VP selection process. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's criticism, then Ginsburg's remarks, his stance on her involvement, his VP process, and conclude with his reliance on instinct. I'll make sure to use "unbefitting" and "involved" as per the user's request. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she should apologize to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about the nation under Trump, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump argued it was "unbefitting" for a Supreme Court justice to get "involved" in a political campaign, calling her statements a disgrace. He also hinted at wanting her to step down from the court. Meanwhile, Trump discussed his vice-presidential selection process, stating he was narrowing down candidates based on instinct and experience, not fundraising potential. He praised several potential candidates, including Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich, while also considering polling data. Trump emphasized that his decision would be largely gut-driven. END OF SUMMARY.
