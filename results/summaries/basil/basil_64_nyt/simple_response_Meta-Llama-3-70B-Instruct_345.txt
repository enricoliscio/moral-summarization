SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting that she owes an apology to the Supreme Court. Trump believes that a Supreme Court justice should not get involved in a political campaign, and that Ginsburg's comments were unbefitting of the high court. Trump's remarks come after Ginsburg expressed her concerns about what the country would look like if Trump were elected, even joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump's criticism of Ginsburg is seen as an attempt to undermine her credibility and independence. Meanwhile, Trump also discussed his plans to announce his running mate by Friday, saying that his decision would be based on instinct rather than fundraising prowess.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump's criticism of Ginsburg is an attempt to silence and discredit a respected member of the Supreme Court, and that his actions are an affront to the independence and integrity of the judiciary. Trump's behavior is portrayed as inappropriate and disrespectful, and his comments are seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of a respected public figure.

END OF SUMMARY.
