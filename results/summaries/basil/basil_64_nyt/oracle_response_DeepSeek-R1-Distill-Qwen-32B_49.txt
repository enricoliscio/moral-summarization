Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the words "unbefitting" and "involved" as they were used by the author. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg for her comments about him being president. He called her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggested she should apologize. Ginsburg expressed fears about the country and the court if Trump is elected. Trump also talked about choosing a running mate, mentioning several candidates and his decision-making process based on instinct.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. The author used "unbefitting" when describing Trump's view of Ginsburg's involvement in the campaign. So I should include that. Also, the word "involved" is part of the moral framing, so I'll make sure to keep that as well.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's criticism, Ginsburg's fears, the inappropriateness of her involvement, and Trump's comments on the running mate. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral terms are included.

I'll start by stating Trump's criticism, mention Ginsburg's fears, use "unbefitting" and "involved" as per the author's framing, then move on to the running mate selection. I'll make sure the summary flows naturally and includes all key points without exceeding the word limit.

Finally, I'll check that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral perspective by using the specified words.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her remarks about his presidency, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she should apologize to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fears about the nation and the court under Trump's leadership, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump deemed her involvement in the political campaign unbefitting for a Supreme Court justice, stating it was a disgrace and only energized his base. He also hinted at his running mate selection, emphasizing instinct over fundraising potential, and praised candidates like Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. Trump's comments reflect his strong stance against judicial involvement in politics and his focus on gut decisions in his campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
