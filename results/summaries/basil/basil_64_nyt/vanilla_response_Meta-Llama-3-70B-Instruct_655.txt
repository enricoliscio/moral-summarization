SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes an apology to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about the country's future if Trump were elected, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump said a Supreme Court judge should not get involved in a political campaign, and her statements only energize his base. Trump also announced he will choose a running mate by Friday, selecting from a pool of five known and two unknown candidates. He emphasized his decision will be based on instinct, not fundraising prowess. Trump praised several potential running mates, including Gov. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Gov. Mike Pence, saying they are strong, patriotic, and solid. Trump also suggested he may target traditionally Democratic states like Connecticut in the general election.
