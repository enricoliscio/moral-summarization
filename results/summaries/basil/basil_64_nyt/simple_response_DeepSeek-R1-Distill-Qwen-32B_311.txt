Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's response to Justice Ginsburg's comments. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

First, the article talks about Trump criticizing Ginsburg for her remarks about him being elected. She expressed fear about the country and the court if he becomes president. Trump called her comments "highly inappropriate" and suggested she should apologize. He also made some strong statements about her being on the court and implied her comments energized his base.

Then, the article moves on to Trump's plans for his running mate, mentioning he has several candidates and is relying on his gut to decide. He's been with these people for a long time and knows them well, which he believes gives him enough information to choose without needing more tryouts.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments, his reaction, and his process for selecting a running mate. Also, the moral framing is important. The author seems critical of Trump for attacking a Supreme Court justice, so I should reflect that in the summary.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Maybe start by stating Trump's criticism, then Ginsburg's comments, his reaction, and then briefly mention his running mate selection process. I should highlight his view that a justice shouldn't get involved in politics, which is a moral point about appropriate behavior for justices.

Also, the article mentions that Trump's comments energize his base, so that's a point to include. Maybe note that he hopes Ginsburg steps down soon, which is a strong statement. Then, transition to his running mate decision, emphasizing his reliance on gut feeling and experience with the candidates.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the key points without being too detailed. Let me structure it: start with Trump's criticism, Ginsburg's quotes, his reaction, then his running mate process, and end with his focus on gut feeling.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise. Also, ensure that the moral aspect is clear, like Trump's belief that justices shouldn't interfere in politics, and the criticism of Ginsburg's remarks.

Let me check the word count as I write to make sure it's under 200. I think I have all the necessary points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
