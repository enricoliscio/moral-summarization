Okay, I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump's reaction to Justice Ginsburg's comments. Let me read through the article first.

So, Trump criticized Ginsburg for her remarks about him becoming president, calling it inappropriate. Ginsburg said she was frightened about the country if Trump was elected and even joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump thinks it's a disgrace and wants her to apologize. He also mentioned wanting her to leave the court soon.

Then, the article talks about Trump's plans for choosing a running mate. He has five candidates plus two unknowns. He's basing his decision on instinct and experience, not fundraising. He mentions Christie, Gingrich, and Pence as possible choices. He also believes he can win in states like Connecticut.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments, his call for an apology. Then move on to his running mate selection process, the candidates, and his strategy.

I should make sure the summary includes all key points: Ginsburg's comments, Trump's reaction, his running mate process, and his political strategy. Keep it concise and clear.
