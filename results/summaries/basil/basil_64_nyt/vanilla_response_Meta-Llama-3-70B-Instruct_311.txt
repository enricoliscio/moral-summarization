SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes an apology to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the country would be like if Trump were elected. Trump said it's a "disgrace" for a Supreme Court judge to get involved in a political campaign and that her comments only energize his base. Meanwhile, Trump announced that he expects to reveal his running mate by Friday, saying the decision will be based on his gut instinct. He mentioned five candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Gov. Mike Pence, and praised each of them. Trump also suggested that he would consider polling in states like Connecticut, which he believes he could win in November.
