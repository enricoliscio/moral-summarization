Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a specific news article about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg. 

First, I need to follow the two steps they outlined. The first step is to identify all single words that are morally framed in the article. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "disdainful," "inappropriate," "disgrace," "apology," "energizes," "good," "patriot," "terrific," "solid," "good guy." These words express judgment or evaluation, so they fit the moral framing.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be no longer than 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her remarks about him being president, his reaction, and then touch on his vice-presidential selection process. I'll include the moral words where they fit naturally to maintain the original framing.

I should also make sure the summary flows well and covers the main points: Trump's disapproval of Ginsburg's comments, the political implications, his selection of a running mate, and his evaluation of potential candidates. Keeping it under 200 words while preserving the moral elements is key. I'll structure it to first address the conflict between Trump and Ginsburg, then move on to his campaign decisions, ensuring all important details are included without being too lengthy.

Finally, I'll end the summary with the specified tokens, making sure it's clear and meets the user's requirements. I'll double-check that I've included all the morally framed words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining the moral perspective.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owed the court an apology. Ginsburg had expressed fears about the nation under Trump's presidency, joking about relocating to New Zealand. Trump accused her of being beneath the court and implied she should step down. He also discussed his vice-presidential selection, emphasizing instinct and experience over fundraising, with candidates like Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Mike Pence in consideration. Trump praised Christie as "excellent" and Gingrich as "a good guy," while also highlighting Joni Ernst as "terrific" and Pence as "solid." His running mate decision was nearing completion, with polling in key states like Connecticut influencing his strategy. END OF SUMMARY.
