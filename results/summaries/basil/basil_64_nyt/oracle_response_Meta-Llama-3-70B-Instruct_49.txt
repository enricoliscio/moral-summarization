SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her "highly inappropriate" comments about his candidacy, saying she should apologize to the Supreme Court for her "unbefitting" remarks. Trump found it "disgraceful" that a Supreme Court judge would get "involved" in a political campaign, and suggested she should step down from the court as soon as possible. Trump's comments came after Justice Ginsburg expressed her fears about what the country would be like if Trump were elected, jokingly suggesting she might move to New Zealand. Trump claimed that her remarks would only energize his base further. Meanwhile, Trump announced that he would be selecting a running mate by Friday, and that his decision would be based on instinct rather than fundraising prowess or polling.

END OF SUMMARY.
