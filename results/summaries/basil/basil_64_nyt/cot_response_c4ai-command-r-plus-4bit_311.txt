SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has criticized Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Supreme Court justice, for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate". He suggested that her comments were a disgrace to the court and that she should apologize and get off the court as soon as possible. Trump's remarks come in response to Ginsburg's statement that she was frightened by the prospect of a Trump presidency and couldn't imagine the country under his leadership. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Ginsburg's comments unbefitting of a Supreme Court justice and said that they would only energize his base further. In other news, Trump is expected to announce his vice-presidential running mate soon, with a decision likely based on his gut instinct. He praised the candidates under consideration, including Governor Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Governor Pence, as excellent, solid, and good, respectively. Trump also mentioned that he believes he can put heavily Democratic states like Connecticut in play in the upcoming election. END OF SUMMARY.
