Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her comments about his candidacy. She expressed fears about him becoming president, even joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her remarks inappropriate and suggested she should apologize to the court. He also mentioned wanting her to leave the court soon.

Additionally, Trump talked about choosing his running mate, saying he has five main candidates and two others. He emphasized that his decision is based on instinct and experience, not fundraising. He mentioned several potential candidates, including Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Mike Pence. He also discussed his strategy for the election, considering states like Connecticut.

I should condense this into a concise summary, focusing on Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, his comments on the running mate selection, and his election strategy. Keep it under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Make sure to include the key points: Ginsburg's comments, Trump's reaction, the running mate candidates, and his approach to the election. Avoid unnecessary details to keep it brief and clear.
