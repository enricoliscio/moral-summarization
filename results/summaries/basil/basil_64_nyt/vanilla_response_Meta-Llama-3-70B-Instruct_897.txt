SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her comments on his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes an apology to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the country would be like if Trump were elected, even joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump said her remarks were unbefitting a Supreme Court judge and only energized his base. Separately, Trump said he would announce his running mate by Friday, choosing from a pool of five known candidates and two unknown ones. He emphasized that his decision would be based on instinct, rather than fundraising prowess or tryouts on the campaign trail. Trump also mentioned that he would consider polling in states like Connecticut, which he believes he could put in play in November.

END OF SUMMARY.
