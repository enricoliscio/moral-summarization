Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Trump's response to Ginsburg's comments. First, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. Let me read through the article again to spot those.

The article mentions Trump calling Ginsburg's remarks "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace." He also says her comments are "beneath the court" and hopes she would "get off the court." These words carry strong moral judgments. 

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments about him, his thoughts on the vice-presidential candidates, and his campaign strategy.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's criticism, then Ginsburg's quotes, followed by his comments on the running mate, and end with his campaign approach. I'll make sure to include the moral words like "highly inappropriate," "disgrace," "beneath," and "get off the court" to maintain the original framing.

I also need to keep the summary clear and straightforward, avoiding any additional analysis beyond what's in the article. Let me piece it together, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace" to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about the nation under Trump's presidency, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump accused her of making statements "beneath the court" and suggested she should "get off the court as soon as possible." He also discussed his vice-presidential selection process, emphasizing his "gut" instinct and dismissing fundraising as a factor. Trump highlighted potential candidates like Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich, while also considering polling data. His comments reflect his campaign strategy and personal judgment in choosing a running mate.
