SUMMARY: Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president, has criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her recent comments expressing fear and dismay at the prospect of a Trump presidency. Trump called Ginsburg's remarks "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace to the court," suggesting that she should apologize and step down from her position. Ginsburg's comments, made in an interview with The Times, reflected her concern about the potential impact of a Trump presidency on the nation and the court. Trump, in response, asserted that Ginsburg's involvement in the political campaign was unbefitting of a Supreme Court judge. Meanwhile, Trump is nearing a decision on his vice-presidential pick, with a shortlist that includes Governor Chris Christie, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, Senator Joni Ernst, and Governor Mike Pence. Trump indicated that his choice would be largely based on instinct and that he expected to announce his running mate within the next few days.
END OF SUMMARY.
