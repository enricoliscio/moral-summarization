Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Trump is upset because Ginsburg made negative comments about him being president. She said she was frightened and even joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her remarks "highly inappropriate" and thinks she should apologize. He also mentioned wanting her to leave the court as soon as possible. That's a strong statement, showing he feels she overstepped her role.

Then, the article talks about Trump's vice presidential search. He's considering several candidates, like Christie, Gingrich, Pence, etc. He's basing his decision on instinct and experience rather than fundraising. This part shows his approach to selecting a running mate.

I need to make sure the summary includes both parts: Trump's criticism of Ginsburg and his VP selection process. Also, the moral aspect is importantâ€”Trump is criticizing Ginsburg for being too political, which he sees as inappropriate for a Supreme Court justice. I should highlight that tension.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Start with Trump's criticism, mention Ginsburg's comments, his reaction, then move on to the VP selection, noting the candidates and his criteria. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure to include all necessary elements without exceeding the limit. Also, the summary should end with the specified tokens. Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Time to put it all together concisely.
