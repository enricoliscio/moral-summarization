SUMMARY:

Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for speaking out against his presidential candidacy, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owes an apology to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about what the country would look like if Trump were elected. Trump said it's a "disgrace" for a Supreme Court judge to get involved in a political campaign and hopes she will step down soon. Meanwhile, Trump announced he will reveal his running mate by Friday, choosing from a pool of seven candidates. He emphasized that his decision will be based on instinct, rather than fundraising prowess. Trump praised several potential running mates, including Gov. Chris Christie, Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Senator Joni Ernst, Gov. Mike Pence, and Newt Gingrich. He also suggested he may target traditionally Democratic states like Connecticut in the general election.
