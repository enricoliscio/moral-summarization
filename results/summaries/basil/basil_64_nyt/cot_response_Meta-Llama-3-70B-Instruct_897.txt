SUMMARY:
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's "highly inappropriate" comments about his candidacy, calling them a "disgrace" to the Supreme Court. Trump said Ginsburg's remarks, in which she expressed fear about what the country would be like with him as president, were "beneath" the court. He demanded an apology from her and even suggested she should step down. Trump also discussed his search for a running mate, saying he would make a decision based on his "gut" and praising candidates like Gov. Chris Christie, who was "excellent" and "strong", and Newt Gingrich, who is a "good guy". Trump expressed confidence in his ability to win in November, even suggesting he could put heavily Democratic states like Connecticut in play. END OF SUMMARY.
