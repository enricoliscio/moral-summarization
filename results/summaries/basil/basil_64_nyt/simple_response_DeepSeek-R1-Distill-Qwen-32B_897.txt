Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her comments about his candidacy. She expressed fear about the country if he were elected, even joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump called her remarks "highly inappropriate," suggesting she should apologize and even hoping she would step down. He also talked about choosing his running mate, mentioning several candidates and his process based on instinct.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be about the appropriateness of a Supreme Court Justice commenting on a political candidate. The author likely presents this as a conflict between judicial integrity and political partisanship. I need to make sure the summary reflects that tension without adding my own opinions.

I'll start by stating Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, then her comments, his reaction, and his mention of the running mate. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspect is clearâ€”whether it's about the role of judges in politics or the decorum expected from them.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the essence of the moral issue presented.
