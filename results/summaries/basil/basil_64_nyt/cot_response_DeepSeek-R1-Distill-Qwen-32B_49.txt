Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: identifying morally framed words and then summarizing the article using those words.

Starting with the first part, I need to go through the article and pick out single words that carry moral connotations. I'll read through the text carefully. The article is about Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg for her comments about him becoming president. Words like "assailed," "disdainful," "highly inappropriate," "disgrace," "apology," "frightened," "contemplate," "joked," "energizes," "instinct," "gut," "terrific," "exciting," "solid," "patriot," and "good" stand out as having moral implications.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the moral framing from the original text. I'll make sure to include Trump's criticism of Ginsburg, her comments about the presidency, his reaction, and the mention of his vice-presidential candidates. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring that the key moral points are highlighted.

I should also pay attention to the structure: first, list the morally framed words, then provide the summary. The summary needs to be clear and capture the essence of the article while preserving the moral elements. I'll avoid adding any extra information not present in the original text and keep the language straightforward.

Finally, I'll double-check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all the key points are included. Making sure that the summary accurately reflects Trump's criticism, Ginsburg's fears, and the mention of potential running mates with their respective moral descriptors.

Ginsburg had expressed fear about the nation's future under Trump, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump accused her of behaving "beneath the court" and said her comments "energized" his base. He also hinted at selecting a vice-presidential candidate soon, emphasizing his "gut" instinct in the decision. Potential candidates included Gov. Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and others, with Trump describing them as "strong," "patriotic," and "terrific." Trump also discussed his campaign strategy, including targeting states like Connecticut. END OF SUMMARY.
