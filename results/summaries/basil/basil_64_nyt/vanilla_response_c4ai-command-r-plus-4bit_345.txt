SUMMARY: Donald Trump criticized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her comments on his presidential campaign, calling them "highly inappropriate." Ginsburg had expressed fear about the prospect of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump suggested that Ginsburg's remarks were unbefitting of a Supreme Court Justice and that she should apologize and step down from her position. Trump also discussed his vice-presidential selection process, stating that he had narrowed it down to five candidates, including Governor Chris Christie, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Senator Joni Ernst, Governor Mike Pence, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. He described each candidate briefly and positively, indicating that his decision would be largely based on instinct. Trump also mentioned that he believed he could put traditionally Democratic states like Connecticut in play in the November election.
END OF SUMMARY.
