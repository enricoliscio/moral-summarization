SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them inappropriate and a disgrace to the Supreme Court. Trump suggested that Ginsburg should apologize for her comments, which he found to be beneath the court. Ginsburg had expressed her fear of what the country would become if Trump were elected and joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called for Ginsburg to step down from the court as soon as possible. In other news, Trump is expected to announce his vice-presidential pick soon, with a decision likely to be made based on his gut instinct. He praised the contenders, describing Governor Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich as excellent, Governor Mike Pence as solid as a rock, Senator Joni Ernst as terrific and exciting, and Lieutenant General Mike Flynn as a patriot. Trump also believes he can put heavily Democratic states like Connecticut in play during the election. END OF SUMMARY.
