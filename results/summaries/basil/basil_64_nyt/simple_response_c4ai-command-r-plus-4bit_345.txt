SUMMARY: Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United States, lashed out at Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her recent comments criticizing his candidacy and expressing fear about the future of the country should he be elected. Trump deemed Ginsburg's remarks "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace to the court," suggesting that she owed the other justices an apology and should step down from her position. This incident highlights a breach of ethical boundaries, as Ginsburg's outspoken disdain for Trump calls into question her ability to remain impartial and undermines the integrity of the Supreme Court. Trump, known for his controversial statements and divisive campaign, took offense at Ginsburg's remarks, which included her joking about moving to New Zealand if he were elected. As Trump moves closer to announcing his vice-presidential pick, the clash between him and Ginsburg underscores the tense political climate and the importance of maintaining impartiality and respect for democratic institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
