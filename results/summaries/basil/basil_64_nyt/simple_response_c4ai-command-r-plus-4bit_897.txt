SUMMARY: Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, lashed out at Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after she criticized his candidacy in an interview with The Times. Trump called Ginsburg's remarks "highly inappropriate" and a "disgrace to the court," suggesting that she should apologize and step down from her position. Ginsburg had expressed fear about the prospect of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand if he were elected. Trump, known for his impulsive and undiplomatic behavior, responded with characteristic vitriol, impugning Ginsburg's integrity and suggesting that her comments were politically motivated. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to announce his choice for vice president soon, with the decision apparently coming down to his "gut feeling." The candidates under consideration include Governor Chris Christie, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Senator Joni Ernst, Governor Mike Pence, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. Trump praised each candidate, describing them as "strong," "a patriot," "exciting," "solid," and "a good guy," respectively.
END OF SUMMARY.
