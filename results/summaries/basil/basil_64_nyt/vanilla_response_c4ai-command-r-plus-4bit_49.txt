SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's criticism of his presidential campaign, calling her remarks "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she should apologize to the court. Ginsburg had expressed fear about the prospect of a Trump presidency and joked about moving to New Zealand. Trump also discussed his vice-presidential selection process, stating that he would announce his decision within the next few days. He mentioned that his choice would be based on instinct and mentioned several candidates, including Governor Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Mike Flynn, Senator Joni Ernst, and Governor Mike Pence. Trump described each candidate with positive adjectives such as "strong," "patriot," and "solid as a rock." He also indicated that he believed he could put traditionally Democratic states like Connecticut in play during the general election.
