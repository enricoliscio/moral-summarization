SUMMARY: Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his presidential candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting that she owed the other justices an apology for getting involved in a political campaign. Trump's remarks came in response to Ginsburg's statement that she was frightened by the prospect of a Trump presidency and couldn't imagine the country or the court with him as president. Trump found Ginsburg's comments unbefitting of a Supreme Court judge and a disgrace to the court. He suggested that her remarks would only energize his base more and called for her to step down from the court as soon as possible. In other news, Trump discussed his vice-presidential selection process, indicating that his decision would be based largely on instinct and that he had five candidates, plus two unknown contenders, under consideration. He praised the strengths of some of the potential running mates, including Governor Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Governor Mike Pence, and Senator Joni Ernst.
END OF SUMMARY.
