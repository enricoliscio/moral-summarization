Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this user's query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. 

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user provided a news article about Donald Trump criticizing Justice Ginsburg for her comments on the presidential race. They want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Okay, so step one is to go through the article and pick out the words that carry moral connotations. Words like "assailed," "disdainful," "inappropriate," "apology," "frightened," "disgrace," "contemplate," "joked," "energizes," "base," "unknown," "gut," "patriot," "terrific," "exciting," "solid," "good." These words seem to carry some moral judgment or emotion.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should capture the main points: Trump criticizing Ginsburg, her comments about him, his reaction, and his thoughts on his running mate. I should make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll include words like "assailed," "disgrace," "energizes," etc.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it properly, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while highlighting the moral aspects.

I think I've got a good grasp on this. I'll start by identifying the morally framed words, then craft a summary that weaves them in naturally.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her disdainful remarks about his candidacy, calling them "highly inappropriate" and suggesting she owed the court an apology. Ginsburg had expressed fear about the nation's future under Trump, joking about moving to New Zealand. Trump accused her of energizing his base and implied she should leave the court. He also discussed his upcoming vice-presidential pick, emphasizing instinct and experience over fundraising, while praising candidates like Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and Mike Pence. Trump's remarks highlighted his focus on gut instincts and the moral implications of Ginsburg's comments. END OF SUMMARY.
