Okay, I need to summarize this article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. Let me read through the article first. 

The article says Obama is going to use a comprehensive plan involving both legislation and executive orders. He's focusing on expanding background checks and possibly banning assault weapons. Since Congress is divided, he'll also take actions on his own, like limiting imported guns and improving mental health record sharing. He's using a task force led by Biden, and the plan is detailed with 19 executive actions. 

There's opposition from gun rights groups and some lawmakers threatening impeachment. The administration believes in tackling the issue despite political challenges, especially after the Newtown shooting. They're also addressing broader issues like mental health and criminal justice.

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the main points: the plan includes legislation and executive actions, focus on background checks and assault weapons, potential actions like import limits and mental health records, opposition from gun groups and some politicians, and the political challenges ahead.

Let me structure it clearly, making sure each key point is included without going over the word limit. I'll start with the main plan, then the actions, opposition, and the context of the Newtown shooting.

SUMMARY: President Obama is set to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, combining major legislation and 19 executive actions. The plan includes expanding background checks, banning assault weapons, and addressing gaps in mental health and criminal justice systems. Obama may act independently to impose limits on imported guns, improve mental health record sharing, and fund gun violence research. Despite opposition from gun rights groups and potential political backlash, the administration aims to push through the politically challenging issue, following the Newtown shooting. The plan reflects a rare opportunity for tighter gun laws after years of Congressional inaction. END OF SUMMARY.
