SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence and increase gun safety in America. He is embracing a comprehensive plan that includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take independently. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who fear he will restrict their rights, but he is committed to focusing on what makes sense and works to prevent gun violence. The plan includes improving mental health records sharing and directing research on gun violence, as well as ratcheting up enforcement of existing laws. There are clear limits to what the president can do without Congressional authority, and he will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress. However, Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of shying away from the issue. The most viable legislative route may be improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows. Obama and Biden are expected to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events to push for gun safety measures. The effort will require enormous pressure and will face challenges, but it is a step towards preventing gun violence and making communities safe.
END OF SUMMARY.
