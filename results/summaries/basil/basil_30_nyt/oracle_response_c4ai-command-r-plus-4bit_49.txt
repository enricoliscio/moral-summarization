SUMMARY: In the aftermath of the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, President Obama is preparing to take comprehensive steps to reduce gun violence. He is willing to use executive orders to strengthen gun control, including expanding background checks for gun purchases and banning assault weapons and high-capacity clips. While some lawmakers threaten impeachment, Obama is focused on what makes sense and works to keep communities safe. The plan includes 19 independent actions the president can take, such as improving mental health records sharing and directing research on gun violence. White House aides believe tougher enforcement of existing laws is crucial, including prosecuting those who lie on background checks. The strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics and the desire to address broader deficiencies in criminal justice and mental health systems. The legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association, but Obama's allies see an opening for tighter gun rules. The most viable legislative route may be improving background check legislation to close huge holes in the process and ensure safer communities. The administration will need to exert enormous pressure on lawmakers to curb access to guns and ammunition, as many senators, including Democratic leader Harry Reid, are longtime supporters of gun rights.
