SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence and take steps to prevent another massacre like the one in Newtown, Connecticut. He is embracing a comprehensive plan that includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take without Congressional approval. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who fear he will abuse his authority to restrict their rights, but he is committed to focusing on what makes sense and works to keep communities safe. The plan includes improving the background check system, which currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows, as well as addressing broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. White House officials believe Obama can also increase enforcement of existing laws and direct the CDC to research gun violence. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, suggested that the president should "clear the table" and use his independent power to ensure that small issues do not derail the bigger legislative fights over gun access. The plan faces intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress, but Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of shying away from the issue. The effort will require an enormous pressure campaign by the administration to get gun legislation through a bitterly divided Congress. Still, Obama is committed to engaging in this fight, focusing on heightened background checks and efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips.
