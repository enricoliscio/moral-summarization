Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is planning to use executive orders to reduce gun violence, including expanding background checks and other measures. There's opposition from gun rights groups and some lawmakers. The article mentions the Newtown massacre, the task force led by Biden, and the legislative challenges.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Words like "reduce," "violence," "massacre," "steps," "happen," "focus," "shooting," "confronting," "deficiencies," "action," "putting," "difference," "holes," "safe," "close," "effort," "clear," "allow," "spent," "checks," "cracking," "trafficking" are key. I should structure the summary to include these words naturally.

I'll start by mentioning Obama's plan to reduce gun violence using executive orders. Then, I'll note the specific actions like expanding background checks and addressing deficiencies. I'll include the opposition and the challenges, using words like "confronting" and "holes." Finally, I'll touch on the legislative efforts and the focus on universal checks and trafficking.

I need to keep it concise, ensuring each sentence flows well and includes the moral framing without being too wordy. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each part of the plan is covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: President Obama is set to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation to expand background checks and 19 executive actions. The plan aims to address the heightened risk of gun violence, particularly following the Newtown massacre, by focusing on steps to prevent such tragedies from happening again. The administration is confronting the deficiencies in the current system, including gaps in mental health record sharing and gun trafficking. Obamaâ€™s actions will include cracking down on illegal gun imports, improving background checks, and enhancing enforcement of existing laws. Despite political opposition, particularly from gun rights groups like the NRA, the administration sees this as a rare opportunity to make a difference in gun safety. The plan also emphasizes the need to close holes in the current system to ensure communities are safer. While some lawmakers, like Representative Steve Stockman, threaten opposition, others, such as Representative Mike Thompson, believe the effort is the most comprehensive in decades. The focus remains on universal background checks and reducing gun trafficking, with the administration planning to keep up pressure through public events and legislative efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
