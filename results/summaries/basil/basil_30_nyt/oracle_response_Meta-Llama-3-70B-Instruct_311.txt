SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes 19 executive actions to confront the deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. The plan aims to focus on common-sense steps to make sure that the kinds of violence seen in the Newtown massacre don't happen again. The president will use his executive power to impose new limits on guns imported from overseas, improve sharing of mental health records, and direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence. Additionally, the administration will push for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, ban assault weapons, and crack down on gun trafficking. The effort faces intense opposition from gun rights groups, but Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of inaction. The president's goal is to take action to reduce gun violence, close the huge holes in the process, and make a difference in keeping communities safe. END OF SUMMARY.
