SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes 19 executive actions and major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases. The plan aims to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips, and improve sharing of mental health records. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence, including imposing new limits on imported guns and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence. The administration's strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire to address the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. While the plan faces intense opposition from gun rights groups, Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the issue for years.

END OF SUMMARY.
