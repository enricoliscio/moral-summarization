Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence using executive orders and legislation. The key points are his comprehensive approach, the 19 executive actions, the push for background checks, and the opposition from gun rights groups. I should highlight the moral aspect, like the administration's focus on preventing future tragedies and the political challenges they face. Also, include the reactions from both supporters and opponents. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to mention the Newtown shooting as the catalyst. I'll structure it by first stating the plan, then the executive actions, the legislative efforts, the opposition, and the political challenges. That should cover the main points while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Obama is set to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation for expanded background checks and 19 executive actions to address gun control without congressional approval. The plan aims to tackle gun violence, mental health deficiencies, and criminal justice gaps, following the Newtown shooting. Obama emphasizes practical solutions over politics, proposing measures like limiting imported guns, improving mental health record sharing, and funding gun violence research. However, the plan faces strong opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers, with some threatening impeachment. While the administration sees a rare opportunity for stricter gun laws, the legislative path is expected to be challenging, with a focus on universal background checks as the most viable route. The effort reflects the complex political landscape of gun control in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
