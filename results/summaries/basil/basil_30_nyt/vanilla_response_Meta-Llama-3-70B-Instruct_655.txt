SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take using executive orders. The plan aims to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips, improve mental health records sharing, and conduct research on gun violence. The president will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence wherever possible, including imposing new limits on imported guns and tougher prosecution of those who lie on background checks. The move is likely to face intense opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers, but Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of inaction. The legislative effort will focus on improving background checks, with many advocates believing it's the most viable route to pursue.

END OF SUMMARY.
