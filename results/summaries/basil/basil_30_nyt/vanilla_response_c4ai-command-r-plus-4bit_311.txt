SUMMARY: President Obama is preparing to take on gun violence in America by presenting a comprehensive plan that includes both legislative action and executive orders. The plan aims to reduce gun violence by expanding background checks for gun purchases and banning assault weapons and high-capacity clips. Obama is willing to use his executive powers to implement some measures, such as improving mental health records sharing and directing the CDC to research gun violence. He faces opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers, but his allies see an opportunity for change after the Newtown massacre. The administration's strategy reflects the uncertain gun politics in America and aims to address broader issues in the criminal justice and mental health systems. Lawmakers and gun education groups believe that improving the background check system is the most viable legislative route, rather than focusing on banning assault weapons. The gun safety effort is expected to face challenges in Congress, especially in the Republican-controlled House. White House officials and lawmakers anticipate separate pieces of legislation to be introduced over time, with Senator Schumer reintroducing a measure to require universal background checks.
END OF SUMMARY.
