SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take using executive orders. The plan aims to close loopholes in the current system, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity clips, and improving mental health records sharing. The president's strategy is to focus on "what makes sense, what works" rather than worrying about politics. While the plan is expected to face intense opposition from gun rights groups, Obama's allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun rules. The administration's approach is to tackle the issue in separate pieces of legislation, with a focus on universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking. The president is willing to use his executive power to reduce gun violence, but White House officials emphasize that there are clear limits to what he can do without Congressional authority.

END OF SUMMARY.
