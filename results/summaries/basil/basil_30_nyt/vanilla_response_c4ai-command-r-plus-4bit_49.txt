SUMMARY: President Obama is preparing to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence in the United States, which includes both legislative actions and executive orders. The plan aims to expand background checks for gun purchases, ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips, and improve mental health records sharing between federal agencies. The president is also expected to increase enforcement of existing laws and direct the CDC to research gun violence. Facing opposition from gun rights groups and some lawmakers, Obama's allies see an opportunity for tighter gun control measures following the recent school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The strategy reflects the complexities of gun politics in America and the need to address broader issues in the criminal justice and mental health systems. Gun control advocates and education groups believe that improving the background check system is the most viable legislative route, rather than focusing solely on banning assault weapons. The administration will face challenges in pushing gun legislation through Congress, with many senators wary of voting on gun control measures. Still, the effort is expected to begin in the Senate, with separate pieces of legislation introduced over time.
END OF SUMMARY.
