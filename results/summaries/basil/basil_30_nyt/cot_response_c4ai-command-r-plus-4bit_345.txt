END OF SUMMARY:
President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence, embracing a comprehensive plan that includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take independently. This comes one month after the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks from gun owners who fear he will abuse his authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, even threatened impeachment if the president uses executive orders to regulate guns. However, White House officials and Democratic lawmakers emphasize that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he can accomplish with Congressional authority. Mr. Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules, with Representative Mike Thompson of California noting the need to close huge holes in the process to keep communities safe. Improving the background check system is seen as the most viable legislative route, with the assault weapons ban considered a low priority. Any efforts to pass gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous pressure campaign from the administration, as many senators are wary of curbing access to guns and ammunition.
