SUMMARY: President Obama is set to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including 19 executive actions and legislative proposals, such as expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. The plan aims to address gun control while acknowledging the political challenges of passing new laws in a divided Congress. Obama emphasizes a focus on "sensible, common-sense steps" to prevent future tragedies like Newtown, Connecticut. The executive actions include limiting imported guns, improving mental health record sharing, and funding gun violence research. The administration faces opposition from gun rights groups and potential political attacks, with some lawmakers threatening impeachment. While the plan reflects a rare opportunity for tighter gun laws, its success will depend on sustained pressure and navigating political divides. The strategy also seeks to address broader issues in criminal justice and mental health systems. END OF SUMMARY.
