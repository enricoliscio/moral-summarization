Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points without adding my own opinions. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main ideas. Obama is proposing a comprehensive plan that includes both legislation and executive actions. The legislation focuses on expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. Since Congress is divided, he's also using executive orders for things like importing guns and mental health records. 

There's opposition from gun rights groups and some lawmakers, like the threat of impeachment. The White House is aware of the political challenges but sees this as a rare opportunity for change. The article also mentions the importance of background checks over banning assault weapons.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Obama's plan, the legislative and executive actions, opposition, and the focus on background checks. I should make sure to include the moral aspects, like the goal to prevent future tragedies and the political challenges involved.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes all key elements without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama plans to address gun violence through a comprehensive strategy, including major legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons, as well as 19 executive actions. The plan aims to reduce gun violence by improving mental health record sharing, increasing enforcement of existing laws, and conducting research on gun violence. Despite opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers, Obama emphasizes practical solutions over politics. The strategy reflects the challenges of passing gun control in a divided Congress, with a focus on universal background checks as the most viable legislative route. The administration will push for these measures through public events and legislative efforts, though opposition remains strong.  

END OF SUMMARY.
