SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes 19 executive actions and major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases. The plan aims to confront the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems, and to take steps to ensure that the kind of violence seen in the Newtown massacre doesn't happen again. The president is willing to use executive orders to impose new limits on guns imported from overseas, improve sharing of mental health records, and direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence. The administration's strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America, but Mr. Obama is focused on what makes sense and what works, rather than worrying about the politics. The plan is likely to face intense opposition from gun rights groups, but supporters see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the issue for years. The goal is to close the huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe.
