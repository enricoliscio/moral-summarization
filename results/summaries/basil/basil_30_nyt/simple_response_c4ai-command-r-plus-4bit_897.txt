SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence by imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, improving the sharing of mental health records between federal agencies, and directing the CDC to research gun violence. He is also considering tougher prosecution of those who lie on background checks. This strategy reflects the difficulty of pushing new gun control measures through a divided Congress, and invites attacks from gun owners who fear their rights will be restricted. The administration's plan includes major legislation to expand background checks and efforts to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips. Mr. Obama's allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun control measures, and believe that improving the background check system is the most viable route. The White House strategy will likely involve public events and pressure campaigns to keep the issue at the forefront of the political agenda. The gun safety effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress, but the administration is committed to taking "sensible, common-sense steps" to prevent more tragedies like the Newtown massacre.
