SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including 19 executive actions and major legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons. The plan aims to focus on common-sense steps to prevent another massacre like the one in Newtown, Conn. By using executive orders, Obama is taking action to confront the deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. However, this move is likely to invite political attacks from gun owners who fear the president will abuse his authority to restrict their rights. Despite the opposition, Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules, citing huge holes in the current process that need to be closed to keep communities safe. The administration's strategy involves a sustained pressure campaign to push for legislative action, with a focus on universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.
