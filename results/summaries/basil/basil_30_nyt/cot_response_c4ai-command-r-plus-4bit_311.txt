END OF SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence. He will embrace a comprehensive plan, including major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take without Congressional approval. These actions include imposing limits on guns imported from overseas, improving mental health records sharing, and directing research on gun violence. Obama is inviting attacks from gun owners who fear he will abuse his authority to restrict their rights. He faces intense opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers they support. However, Obama's allies see an opening for tighter gun rules. There is an emerging consensus that improving the background check system is the most viable route, as it has huge holes that need to be closed to keep communities safe. Any efforts to pass gun legislation will require a ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration. Obama's legislative effort will likely face opposition in Congress, but gun safety efforts are expected to be debated separately over time.
