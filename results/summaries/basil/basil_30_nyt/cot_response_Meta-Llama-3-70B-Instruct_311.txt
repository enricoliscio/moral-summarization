SUMMARY:
President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including 19 executive actions and major legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons. The plan aims to make sense and focus on what works, rather than worrying about politics. However, the move is likely to face intense opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers who see gun rights as a defining issue. Despite the uncertainty, Obama's allies believe there is a rare opening for tighter gun rules. The plan includes efforts to improve the system of background checks, which is seen as the most viable legislative route to pursue. The administration will need to apply enormous and ceaseless pressure on lawmakers to get gun legislation through Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
