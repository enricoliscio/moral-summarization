SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence, despite the political attacks and impeachment threats from gun rights advocates. Obama is focusing on the biggest legislative fight over guns in nearly two decades, including heightened background checks and restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity clips. While some fear that Obama will abuse his authority to restrict gun rights, the President has promised to act independently to address the deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. Obama is inviting attacks by gun owners who believe he will abuse his power to restrict their rights, yet he has clear limits and no plans to push beyond what he can accomplish independently. The President faces intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters, but allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of Congress shying away from the issue. The emerging consensus on Capitol Hill is that improving the background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable route. Obama has promised to ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of those who lie on background checks, and his strategy reflects a desire to address the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. Obama's willingness to act independently on gun safety is part of the most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation, and he has invited attacks by gun owners who fear the restriction of their rights. Obama has clear limits to his authority and no plans to push beyond what he can accomplish independently, but he faces intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters. However, allies see a rare opportunity to tighten gun rules and improve community safety. Obama is committed to using his power to make a difference, and he is inviting attacks by gun owners while also addressing broader issues.
