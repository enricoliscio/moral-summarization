SUMMARY: President Obama is preparing to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence in the United States, including a push for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases. The plan also includes 19 separate actions that the president can take through executive orders, such as imposing new limits on imported guns and improving mental health record-sharing between federal agencies. White House aides believe that Obama can also increase enforcement of existing laws and direct the CDC to conduct research on gun violence. There is opposition to the plan from gun rights groups and some lawmakers, but Obama's allies see an opportunity for tighter gun control measures following the recent mass shootings. The legislative effort will face challenges in Congress, with many senators wary of voting on gun control measures, but the White House is expected to keep up the pressure with public events and a comprehensive strategy. The gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation introduced over time, with a focus on improving background check legislation.
