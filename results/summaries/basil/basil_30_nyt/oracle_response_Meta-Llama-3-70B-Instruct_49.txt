SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes major legislation to expand background checks and 19 separate actions he can take using executive orders. The plan aims to confront the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. The president's focus is on taking sensible, common-sense steps to ensure that the kind of violence seen in the Newtown massacre doesn't happen again. He will use his executive power to impose new limits on guns imported from overseas, improve sharing of mental health records, and conduct research on gun violence. The administration's strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America, and Obama is willing to take action to make a difference, despite potential political attacks. The plan's legislative effort will face intense opposition, but allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of inaction. The goal is to close the huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe.

END OF SUMMARY.
