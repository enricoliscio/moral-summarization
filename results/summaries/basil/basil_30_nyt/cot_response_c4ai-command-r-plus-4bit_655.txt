END OF SUMMARY:
President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence and improve gun safety. He will embrace a comprehensive plan that includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take independently. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who fear he will abuse his authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman threatened to file articles of impeachment if Obama regulates guns with executive orders. White House officials acknowledge limits to what the president can do without Congressional authority. Obama's legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supported lawmakers. However, Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the issue for years. There is a consensus that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable route. Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require enormous pressure from the administration. Scores of senators will be wary of voting on curbing access to guns or ammunition. Gun legislation is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, which is controlled by Republicans who oppose new restrictions. The White House strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics and the desire to address the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems.
