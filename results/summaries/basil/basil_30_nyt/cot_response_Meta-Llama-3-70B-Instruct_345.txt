SUMMARY:
President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence, focusing on expanded background checks, banning assault weapons, and improving mental health records. Despite potential political attacks, Obama is committed to taking "sensible, common-sense steps" to prevent future tragedies like the Newtown massacre. The administration's strategy acknowledges the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the need to address broader deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems. While some lawmakers and gun rights groups may oppose the measures, Obama's allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun rules. The president's plan includes 19 separate actions he can take by invoking executive power, including imposing new limits on imported guns and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence.
