Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that President Obama is planning a comprehensive approach to gun control. He's going to propose major legislation, like expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. But since getting laws passed in Congress is tough, he'll also use executive orders. These orders include limiting imported guns, improving mental health record sharing, and funding research on gun violence. He's also focusing on enforcing existing laws more strictly.

There's some opposition too. Gun rights groups and some Republicans, like Representative Stockman, are threatening impeachment if Obama uses executive orders. The administration is aware of the political challenges and knows they can't do everything without Congress.

The article also talks about the legislative process. The plan starts in the Senate, and there's a push for universal background checks, which is seen as more achievable than banning assault weapons. The effort will require a lot of pressure from the administration, and it's likely to be a long battle with Congress.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Obama's plan, then mention the legislative and executive actions, opposition, and the legislative challenges. I'll make sure to include key points like the 19 executive actions, background checks, mental health records, and the political pushback. Also, note that the focus is on background checks over assault weapons bans. Keep it concise and cover all main aspects without getting too detailed.
