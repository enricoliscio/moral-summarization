SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence by imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, improving mental health records sharing between federal agencies, and directing the CDC to research gun violence. He is also committed to tougher prosecution of those who lie on background checks. This strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire to address the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. White House officials acknowledge the limits of executive action and do not plan to exceed what requires Congressional authority. The legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supported lawmakers. However, Obama's allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun rules. The most viable legislative route is improving the background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows. Gun control advocates believe this is a ripe moment for new restrictions on guns like those used in Newtown, and there is a consensus that improving the background check system will have the greatest impact on reducing gun violence. The gun safety effort will likely be debated in separate pieces of legislation introduced over time, with the first being a measure by Senator Schumer to require universal background checks and improve the background check system. Obama and Biden are expected to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events.
END OF SUMMARY.
