Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words the author used that carry moral implications. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence using executive orders and legislative efforts. The key moral terms include reducing violence, steps to prevent massacres, confronting deficiencies, closing holes, and the effort to make communities safe.

I should start by identifying the main actions Obama is taking: using executive orders for background checks, banning assault weapons, and administrative measures like importing guns and mental health records. Then, I need to mention the political opposition and the challenges in Congress. The summary should highlight the moral imperative to prevent future violence and the comprehensive approach taken.

I'll structure the summary to include the plan's goals, the specific actions, the political pushback, and the potential impact. I'll make sure to use as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but comprehensive. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: President Obama is proposing a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation for expanded background checks and 19 executive actions to address the issue. The plan aims to prevent future massacres like Newtown by focusing on sensible steps such as banning assault weapons and cracking down on trafficking. However, given the politically charged environment, Obama will also act independently to reduce violence, such as limiting imported guns and improving mental health record sharing. The administration is confronting deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems while facing opposition from gun rights groups and lawmakers. Despite potential political attacks, Obamaâ€™s allies see an opportunity to close gaps in current laws and make communities safer. The effort reflects a rare push for tighter gun rules, with a focus on universal background checks as the most viable legislative route. The plan is part of the most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation, aiming to make a difference by addressing holes in the system and ensuring safety for all. END OF SUMMARY.
