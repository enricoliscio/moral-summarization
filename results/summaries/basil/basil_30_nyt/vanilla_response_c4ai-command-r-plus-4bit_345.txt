SUMMARY: President Obama plans to announce a comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence in America, including major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 executive actions he can take independently. The plan comes one month after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting and faces intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress. White House officials believe Obama can strengthen existing laws and improve mental health and criminal justice systems. Obama's legislative effort will include a focus on heightened background checks and efforts to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips. Executive actions are likely to include imposing limits on imported guns, improving sharing of mental health records, and directing research on gun violence. Lawmakers and gun control advocates see an opportunity for tighter gun restrictions, with improving background check legislation as the most viable route. The strategy reflects the political challenges and the desire to address both gun violence and broader system deficiencies. The White House will face strong resistance from gun rights advocates and lawmakers, with some threatening impeachment if executive orders are used to restrict gun rights. Supporters see a rare opening for change and believe Obama's strategy is comprehensive and necessary to make a difference in gun safety.
END OF SUMMARY.
