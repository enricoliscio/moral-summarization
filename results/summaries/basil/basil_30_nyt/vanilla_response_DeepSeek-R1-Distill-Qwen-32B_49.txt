Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. Let me read through it carefully. The article mentions that Obama is planning to use executive orders and push for legislation, including expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. He's also taking administrative actions like limiting imported guns and improving mental health record sharing. There's opposition from gun rights groups and some lawmakers, like Steve Stockman threatening impeachment. The plan includes 19 executive actions and aims to address gaps in the system. The legislative push might face challenges, especially in the Senate. The summary needs to capture the key points: the plan's components, opposition, and the strategy to tackle gun violence through various means. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.
