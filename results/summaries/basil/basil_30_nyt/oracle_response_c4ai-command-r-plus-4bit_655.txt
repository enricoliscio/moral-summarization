SUMMARY: President Obama plans to address gun violence in America by pursuing a comprehensive plan that includes both legislative action and executive orders. The plan aims to reduce gun violence by expanding background checks for gun purchases and banning assault weapons and high-capacity clips. Obama is willing to use his executive authority to take action on gun control, such as improving mental health records sharing and directing research on gun violence, while also pushing for major legislation. Lawmakers and gun rights groups are expected to strongly oppose Obama's efforts, with some even threatening impeachment. However, Obama's allies see an opportunity for tighter gun rules and believe that focusing on improving the background check system is the most viable route. The White House strategy reflects a desire to address the deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems while also preventing tragic shootings like the one in Newtown, Connecticut. Obama's plan includes steps to ensure that such violence does not happen again and to make a difference in community safety.
