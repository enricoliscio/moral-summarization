SUMMARY: President Obama is set to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons, as well as 19 executive actions. The plan aims to address deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems, while also confronting the political challenges of passing gun control measures in a divided Congress. Obama will use his executive powers to impose new limits on imported guns, improve mental health record sharing, and direct research on gun violence. However, gun rights groups and lawmakers, including Representative Steve Stockman, have threatened opposition, with some even calling for impeachment. Despite these challenges, Obamaâ€™s allies see an opportunity to push for tighter gun rules, focusing on universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking. The administration will continue to press for legislative action, with efforts likely to begin in the Senate. The plan reflects a rare consensus on Capitol Hill that improving background check systems is the most viable route to reducing gun violence. END OF SUMMARY.
