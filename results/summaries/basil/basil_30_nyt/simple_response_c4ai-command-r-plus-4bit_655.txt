SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence by imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, improving the sharing of mental health records between federal agencies, and directing the CDC to research gun violence. He is also committed to tougher prosecution of those who lie on background checks. This strategy reflects the challenge of passing new gun control legislation through a divided Congress and the urgency to address gun violence in the wake of the Newtown, CT, school shooting. White House officials acknowledge the limits of executive action and do not plan to exceed what would require Congressional authority. Obama's legislative efforts will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress. However, some lawmakers and gun control advocates see an opening for tighter gun rules, with a focus on improving the background check system. The White House strategy includes public events and pressure campaigns to keep the issue in the spotlight and build support for gun safety measures. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, advised the president to "clear the table" by using executive action to address smaller issues and keep the focus on the bigger legislative battles over gun access. The gun safety effort is expected to face challenges in both the Senate and the House, with many senators wary of voting on gun control measures and the House controlled by Republicans who oppose new restrictions. The debate over gun legislation is likely to be a prolonged and complex process, with separate pieces of legislation introduced over time.
END OF SUMMARY.
