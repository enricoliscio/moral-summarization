SUMMARY:
President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence, focusing on expanded background checks, banning assault weapons, and improving mental health records. He aims to take 19 separate actions, including imposing limits on imported guns and directing the CDC to research gun violence. Despite potential political attacks, Obama believes it's essential to take "sensible, common-sense steps" to prevent tragedies like the Newtown massacre. His allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun rules, but opponents, including the NRA, will fiercely resist. The administration plans to introduce legislation in separate pieces, starting with a measure requiring universal background checks. With "enormous and ceaseless pressure," Obama hopes to make a difference in reducing gun violence. END OF SUMMARY.
