Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "reduce," "expand," "ban," "abuse," "impeachment," "opposition," "restrict," "crimes," "deficiencies," "improve," "viable," "impact," "pressure," "curb," "dominate," "effort," "flagged." These words are key because they reflect the ethical and political implications of the policies discussed.

Next, I'll create a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the main points: Obama's plan to use executive orders for gun control, the legislative challenges, the opposition from gun rights groups, and the emphasis on background checks and mental health. I'll ensure the summary is under 200 words and maintains the original moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation to expand background checks and 19 executive actions. The plan aims to address gun control, mental health deficiencies, and criminal justice gaps. Obama will use his executive authority to impose new limits on imported guns, improve mental health record sharing, and fund gun violence research. However, this move invites political opposition, with some gun owners fearing abuse of power and a Republican congressman threatening impeachment. While the administration acknowledges legislative limits, it sees a rare opportunity to push for tighter gun rules. The focus is on universal background checks and curbing gun trafficking, with less emphasis on banning assault weapons. The effort will require sustained pressure, starting with public events and legislative debates in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
