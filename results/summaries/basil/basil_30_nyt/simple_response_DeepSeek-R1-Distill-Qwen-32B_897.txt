Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Obama's comprehensive plan, which includes major legislation for expanding background checks and 19 executive actions. He's using his executive power because Congress is divided, making it hard to pass laws. The plan includes things like limiting imported guns, improving mental health records sharing, and more research on gun violence.

There's a moral angle here. The author presents Obama as taking responsible action to prevent future tragedies like Newtown, focusing on what works rather than politics. However, there's also opposition from gun rights groups and some politicians who fear executive overreach. The summary should highlight Obama's proactive approach and the challenges he faces.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements: the plan's components, the use of executive orders, the opposition, and the broader context of gun politics. I'll make sure to include that Obama is prioritizing sensible measures and that there are political and legislative hurdles.

Let me structure it: start with Obama's plan, mention the 19 executive actions, the legislative push, opposition from gun rights groups, the focus on background checks, and the challenges ahead. I'll also note the political attacks and the administration's strategy to address gun violence comprehensively.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear, making sure the moral framing is evidentâ€”Obama acting responsibly despite political obstacles. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama is unveiling a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation for expanded background checks and 19 executive actions to address gun control without congressional approval. The plan aims to tackle gun trafficking, improve mental health record sharing, and fund gun violence research. Obama emphasizes a focus on "sensible, common-sense steps" to prevent future tragedies like Newtown, prioritizing what works over politics. However, his use of executive power has sparked opposition, with gun rights advocates and some lawmakers threatening legal challenges. While the administration sees a rare opportunity to push for tighter gun laws, significant hurdles remain, including congressional gridlock and resistance from gun rights groups. The strategy reflects a broader effort to address deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems, with a focus on universal background checks as the most viable legislative route. Obama and Biden are expected to maintain pressure on lawmakers through public events, but the path to legislation remains fraught with political challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
