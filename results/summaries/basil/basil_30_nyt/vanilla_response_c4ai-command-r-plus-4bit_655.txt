SUMMARY: President Obama is set to announce a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence in the United States, which includes both legislative and executive actions. The plan calls for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions that the president can take through executive orders. The legislative efforts will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress. However, Obama's allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun control measures in the wake of recent mass shootings. The plan also includes improving the system of background check legislation, which currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows. White House officials believe Obama can also increase enforcement of existing laws and improve information sharing between federal agencies on mental health records. There are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do through executive action, and he will need Congressional authority to accomplish some of his goals. The gun safety effort is expected to face challenges in Congress, with many senators wary of voting on gun control measures, but it is likely to begin in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
