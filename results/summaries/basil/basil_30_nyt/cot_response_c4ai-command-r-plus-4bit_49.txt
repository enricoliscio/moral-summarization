SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence by invoking his executive powers, despite the threat of impeachment from opponents who claim he is seeking to restrict gun ownership rights. There are limits to what the president can do without Congressional authority, but he is still willing to take independent steps to reduce gun violence, including improving background checks and mental health records sharing, directing the CDC to research gun violence, and ratcheting up enforcement of existing laws. Obama invites attacks from gun owners who fear he will abuse his powers to restrict their rights, but he is inviting political attacks in order to prioritize sensible, common-sense gun safety measures. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, supports the president's efforts, urging him to "clear the table" of small issues to focus on the bigger legislative fights over gun access. Improving the background check system is seen as a viable route to improving gun safety, with an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill that universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking are the most morally important issues. Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules, but they acknowledge that gun legislation will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress. Obama's strategy reflects a willingness to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, with a comprehensive approach that addresses both gun violence and the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems.
