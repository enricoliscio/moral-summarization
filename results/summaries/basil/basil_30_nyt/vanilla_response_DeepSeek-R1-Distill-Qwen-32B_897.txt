Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. Let me read through the article first.

The article says Obama is introducing a comprehensive plan that includes major legislation for expanded background checks. He's also considering 19 executive actions. These actions might involve limiting imported guns, sharing mental health records, and researching gun violence. He wants to enforce existing laws more strictly.

There's opposition from gun rights groups and some Republicans. They're worried he'll abuse executive powers. The plan faces tough opposition in Congress, especially the House, which is Republican-controlled. The focus is on background checks and closing loopholes, rather than just banning assault weapons. The effort is seen as a rare chance to pass tighter gun laws.

I should include the main points: Obama's plan, the 19 executive actions, the focus on background checks, opposition, and the legislative challenges. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to mention the key elements without getting too detailed.
