SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, focusing on common-sense steps to make a difference in the wake of the Newtown massacre. The plan includes major legislation to expand background checks and 19 separate actions the president can take using executive orders. These actions aim to confront the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. The president will focus on what works, rather than worrying about politics, to ensure that such violence doesn't happen again. The plan includes imposing new limits on imported guns, improving mental health record sharing, and directing the CDC to research gun violence. The administration's strategy acknowledges the uncertainty of gun politics, but seeks to close the huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe. By taking action, the president aims to reduce gun violence and make a positive difference.
