SUMMARY: President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence by invoking his authority to take action on 19 separate steps without needing Congressional authority. This comes one month after the Newtown school massacre, where 20 children and six adults were killed. The president will also push for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as efforts to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips. The White House believes that Mr. Obama can ratchet up enforcement of existing laws and improve sharing of mental health records to prevent gun violence. He is inviting political attacks by gun owners who fear that their rights will be restricted, but White House officials assert that he will not push beyond what he can accomplish without Congressional approval. Lawmakers and gun rights groups will fiercely oppose any new restrictions on guns, but Mr. Obama's allies see an opening for tighter gun rules after years of inaction. The most viable legislative route is improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows. The administration will need to keep up pressure on lawmakers to pass any gun safety legislation, as many senators will be wary of voting to curb access to guns. Mr. Obama's willingness to use executive orders sends a clear message that he is committed to taking steps to prevent future gun violence and make communities safer.
