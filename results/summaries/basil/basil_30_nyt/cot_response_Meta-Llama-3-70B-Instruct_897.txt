SUMMARY:
President Obama is willing to use executive orders to reduce gun violence, focusing on expanded background checks, banning assault weapons, and improving mental health records. He aims to take 19 separate actions, including imposing limits on imported guns and directing the CDC to research gun violence. While lawmakers and gun rights groups are expected to oppose the plan, Obama believes it's a "sensible" and "common-sense" approach to prevent tragedies like the Newtown massacre. The administration's strategy acknowledges the "uncertainty" of gun politics and the need to address broader deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems. Despite expected opposition, Obama's allies see a "ripe" moment to push for tighter gun rules. The plan is part of the "most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation." END OF SUMMARY.
