Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article says that Obama is going to announce a comprehensive plan using both legislation and executive actions. He wants to expand background checks and introduce 19 executive actions. These actions include things like limiting imported guns, improving mental health record sharing, and more enforcement of existing laws. 

He's doing this after the Newtown shooting, and his focus is on common-sense steps, not worrying about politics. The plan also addresses broader issues like criminal justice and mental health. However, there's opposition from gun rights groups and some lawmakers, like Representative Stockman threatening impeachment. 

The legislative efforts might face tough opposition, but there's hope for some progress, especially on universal background checks. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key elements: the plan's components, the context of Newtown, the use of executive orders, the opposition, and the legislative challenges. 

Let me structure this: start with Obama's plan, mention the components, the context, the executive actions, the opposition, and the legislative efforts. Keep it clear and within the word limit. I think that's a solid approach.
