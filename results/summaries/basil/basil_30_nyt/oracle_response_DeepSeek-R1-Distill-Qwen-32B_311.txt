Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points. 

The article is about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. He's going to use executive orders because pushing legislation through Congress is difficult. There are 19 actions he can take on his own, like expanding background checks, banning assault weapons, and improving mental health records sharing. 

The author uses words like "reduce," "violence," "massacre," "steps," "focus," "deficiencies," "action," "close," "safe," etc. I need to include these in the summary. 

I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's comprehensive approach, the challenges in Congress, and the moral imperative to prevent future violence. Also, mention the opposition and the focus on background checks as the most viable route.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me make sure to include all the key points without getting too detailed. Maybe start with Obama's plan, mention the executive actions, the legislative challenges, and the focus on background checks. 

Also, include that Obama is focusing on sensible steps to prevent violence, and the opposition from gun rights groups. Make sure to use the morally framed words as much as possible.

SUMMARY: President Obama is unveiling a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including 19 executive actions and legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons. The plan aims to address deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems, focusing on steps to prevent future massacres like Newtown. Obama will use his executive authority to impose new limits on imported guns, improve mental health record sharing, and direct research on gun violence. Despite opposition from gun rights groups and potential political attacks, the administration sees this as a rare opportunity to close "holes" in gun safety measures. The effort emphasizes universal background checks and cracking down on trafficking as the most impactful steps. While legislative progress may be slow, Obama is determined to act wherever possible to ensure communities are safer. END OF SUMMARY.
