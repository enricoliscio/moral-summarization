SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes 19 executive actions he can take without Congressional approval. The plan aims to expand background checks for gun purchases, ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips, and improve sharing of mental health records. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence, including imposing new limits on imported guns and directing the CDC to conduct research on gun violence. The administration's strategy acknowledges the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the need to address broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. The plan faces intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the NRA, but Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of Congressional inaction.

END OF SUMMARY.
