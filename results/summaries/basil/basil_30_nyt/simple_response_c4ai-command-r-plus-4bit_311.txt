SUMMARY: President Obama plans to tackle gun violence in America by proposing a comprehensive plan that includes both legislative action and executive orders. The plan aims to reduce gun violence by expanding background checks for gun purchases, banning assault weapons and high-capacity clips, and improving mental health records sharing. Obama's willingness to use executive orders has sparked controversy, with some lawmakers threatening impeachment if he overreaches his authority. However, White House officials assert that Obama will respect the limits of his power and focus on areas where he can make a meaningful difference within the boundaries of his office. The legislative effort will face strong opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress, but Obama's allies see an opportunity for tighter gun rules in the wake of recent tragic events. The administration's strategy reflects a desire to address gun violence while also tackling broader issues in the criminal justice and mental health systems. The plan is expected to be announced as early as Wednesday, marking the start of a significant Congressional fight over guns.
