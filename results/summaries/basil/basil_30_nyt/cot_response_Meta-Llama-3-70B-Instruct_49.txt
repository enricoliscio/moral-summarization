SUMMARY:
President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation to expand background checks and 19 separate executive actions. The plan aims to make sense and work, focusing on common-sense steps to prevent gun violence. However, the proposal has sparked fear among gun owners who believe the president will abuse his authority to restrict their rights. Despite intense opposition from gun rights groups, Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules. The plan includes efforts to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips, as well as improving mental health records and conducting research on gun violence. The administration's strategy reflects a desire to address the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems. END OF SUMMARY.
