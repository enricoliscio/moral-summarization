SUMMARY: President Obama has announced his willingness to use executive orders to reduce gun violence by imposing new limits on guns, improving mental health record sharing, and directing research on gun violence. He intends to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. While gun rights groups and lawmakers oppose new restrictions, Obama's allies see a rare opportunity for tighter gun rules. The administration's strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics and the desire to address broader deficiencies in the criminal justice and mental health systems. White House officials acknowledge limits to what the president can do without Congressional authority, but they plan to use executive action wherever possible to reduce gun violence. The legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups and their supporters in Congress. However, improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is seen as the most viable route. The administration will need to exert enormous pressure on lawmakers to get gun legislation through Congress, and the effort is likely to face resistance even from some Democrats. Still, gun safety advocates believe that the tragedy in Newtown has created a unique opportunity to reduce gun violence and save lives.
END OF SUMMARY.
