Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points and the ethical considerations presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is introducing a comprehensive plan with major legislation and 19 executive actions. The plan includes expanding background checks, banning assault weapons, and using executive orders for things like limiting gun imports and improving mental health records sharing. There's also mention of political opposition, especially from Republicans and the NRA, and the challenges of getting legislation through a divided Congress.

I should highlight Obama's approach of focusing on effectiveness over politics, the administration's strategy to address both legislative and executive actions, and the potential political backlash. It's important to include that while there's support for some measures like universal background checks, others like the assault weapons ban are seen as less urgent.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all the essential elements. I'll structure it to first outline Obama's plan, then the executive actions, followed by the political opposition, and conclude with the legislative challenges and priorities.

Let me make sure I capture the moral framing by emphasizing the desire to prevent future tragedies versus the political pushback on rights and authority. Also, note the administration's strategy to use executive power while facing impeachment threats, which adds a layer of ethical concern about overreach.

I should avoid jargon and keep the summary clear and straightforward, ensuring it reflects the balance between proactive measures and the political realities they face.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama is preparing a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, including major legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons, alongside 19 executive actions to address gun control without congressional approval. The plan aims to improve mental health record sharing, limit imported guns, and increase enforcement of existing laws. Obama emphasized focusing on effective measures rather than political considerations, following the Newtown tragedy. However, his use of executive power has drawn opposition, with some Republicans threatening impeachment and gun rights groups vowing resistance. While universal background checks are seen as a viable legislative route, other measures like banning assault weapons face political challenges. The administration faces a tough battle in Congress, with fiscal issues and partisan divides complicating the push for gun safety reforms. END OF SUMMARY.
