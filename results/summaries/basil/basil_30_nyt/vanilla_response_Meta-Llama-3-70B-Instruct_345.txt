SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to unveil a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, which includes major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and 19 separate actions he can take using executive orders. The plan aims to ban assault weapons and high-capacity clips, improve sharing of mental health records, and conduct research on gun violence. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence, including imposing new limits on imported guns and tougher prosecution of those who lie on background checks. The move is likely to face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association. Despite the challenges, Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after years of inaction. The plan will be debated in separate pieces of legislation, with Senator Charles Schumer set to reintroduce a measure requiring universal background checks.

END OF SUMMARY.
