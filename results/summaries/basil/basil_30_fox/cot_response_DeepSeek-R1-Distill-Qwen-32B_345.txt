Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan, but I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about Obama urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of his gun control plan. He mentions a 10-round limit on magazines and other measures. There are mentions of opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers. He calls for legislation on armor-piercing bullets and background checks. He uses phrases like "protecting the most vulnerable" and "do the right thing." He involves children in the event, which drew some criticism. The plan also includes measures for mental health and school safety. There are executive actions he's taking, which some lawmakers oppose. The most controversial parts are the proposals for Congress, like universal background checks and restrictions on assault weapons. Critics argue that these measures wouldn't have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre and that the focus should be on criminals and the mentally ill, not law-abiding citizens. Some officials and the NRA are against the plan, with the NRA planning an ad campaign. The plan also includes funding for police and schools, and improving mental health services. Boehner's response is neutral, waiting for Senate action.

Now, for the morally framed words. These are words that carry a moral judgment or value. Let me go through the article again and pick them out.

- "urges" – implies a moral call to action.
- "restrictions" – implies limiting something for a moral reason.
- "ban" – a prohibition, often with moral backing.
- "curb" – to control or reduce, suggesting a moral issue.
- "opposition" – indicates conflict over moral stances.
- "protection" – safeguarding, a moral duty.
- "obligation" – a moral responsibility.
- "vulnerable" – refers to those in need of protection, a moral concern.
- "act" – implies taking moral action.
- "right" – moral correctness.
- "involving" – in the context of children, a moral decision.
- "criticism" – moral judgment on the action.
- "pervasive" – widespread negative impact, moral concern.
- "address" – tackling moral issues.
- "improve" – enhancing something for the better, moral improvement.
- "safeguard" – protecting, a moral duty.
- "save" – preventing harm, a moral goal.
- "massacre" – a morally condemnable event.
- "undermine" – attacking a right, a moral issue.
- "constitutional" – related to rights, a moral foundation.
- "focus" – directing efforts towards moral goals.
- "commit" – dedicating resources, a moral commitment.
- "prohibit" – banning something, moral restriction.
- "address" – dealing with moral issues.
- "elitist hypocrite" – moral accusation.
- "haunt" – moral failing.
- "terror" – moral condemnation.
- "misguided" – morally wrong approach.
- "handguns" – morally neutral but contextually framed.
- "resist" – opposing morally.
- "ad campaign" – promoting a moral stance.
- "school security" – moral protection.
- "emergency plans" – moral preparedness.
- "resource officers" – moral support.
- "mental health professionals" – moral care.
- "train" – moral development.
- "coverage" – moral support through policy.
- "neutral" – morally unbiased stance.

Wait, some of these might not be the best examples. Maybe I should focus on words that are more clearly morally charged. Let me go through again.

"urges" – yes, a moral call.
"restrictions" – limiting for a reason.
"ban" – prohibition.
"curb" – control.
"opposition" – against something moral.
"protection" – safeguarding.
"obligation" – duty.
"vulnerable" – needing help.
"act" – taking moral steps.
"right" – correct action.
"criticism" – moral judgment.
"pervasive" – widespread negative impact.
"address" – tackling issues.
"improve" – enhancing morally.
"safeguard" – protecting.
"save" – preventing harm.
"massacre" – morally wrong event.
"undermine" – attacking rights.
"constitutional" – rights-based.
"focus" – on moral issues.
"commit" – dedicating morally.
"prohibit" – banning.
"address" – dealing with moral issues.
"elitist hypocrite" – moral accusation.
"haunt" – moral failing.
"terror" – moral horror.
"misguided" – wrong approach.
"resist" – opposing morally.
"ad campaign" – promoting a stance.
"school security" – moral protection.
"emergency plans" – preparedness.
"resource officers" – support.
"mental health professionals" – care.
"train" – developing morally.
"coverage" – support.
"neutral" – unbiased stance.

I think that's a good list. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these as possible while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Obama's plan, opposition, key measures, executive actions, funding, and criticisms.

I'll make sure to include words like "urges," "restrictions," "ban," "curb," "opposition," "protection," "obligation," "vulnerable," "act," "right," "criticism," "pervasive," "address," "improve," "safeguard," "save," "massacre," "undermine," "constitutional," "focus," "commit," "prohibit," "address," "elitist hypocrite," "haunt," "terror," "misguided," "resist," "ad campaign," "school security," "emergency plans," "resource officers," "mental health professionals," "train," "coverage," "neutral."

Putting it all together, I need to craft a concise summary that flows well and includes these words without making it sound forced. I'll start with Obama's call for restrictions, mention the opposition, outline the measures, touch on the executive actions, funding, and the criticisms, including the NRA's response and the focus on mental health and schools. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**

President Obama has called for stricter gun control measures, urging new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as part of a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence. His proposal faces opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republicans, who argue it undermines constitutional rights. Obama emphasized the obligation to protect the vulnerable, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, we've got an obligation to try." The plan includes universal background checks, banning armor-piercing bullets, and improving school security. Critics, like Sen. Marco Rubio, contend the measures wouldn't have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre and should focus on criminals and the mentally ill. The NRA opposes the plan, calling it misguided, while Obama plans to enhance mental health services and school safety. Despite these efforts, some lawmakers remain neutral, awaiting further action from Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
