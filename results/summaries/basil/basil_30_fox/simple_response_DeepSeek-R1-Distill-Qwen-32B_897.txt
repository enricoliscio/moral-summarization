Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Obama's gun control plan, which includes several measures like banning assault weapons, limiting magazine capacity, and expanding background checks. He's facing opposition from Republicans and gun rights groups. 

I should highlight the moral aspects, such as Obama's emphasis on protecting vulnerable people and the criticism from opponents who argue his approach infringes on rights. I'll also note the mixed reactions from lawmakers and the NRA's campaign against the plan. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating the main proposal, then mention the opposition, followed by the details of the plan and the criticisms. I'll make sure to include key elements like the executive actions and the focus on mental health and school safety. 

I'll also check for any nuances, like the criticism that the plan doesn't address entertainment violence or that most gun crimes involve handguns. Making sure the summary is concise but covers all critical points without losing the moral perspective is important. 

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the proposal, moving to opposition, and then the details and criticisms. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama proposed a comprehensive gun control plan, including a ban on assault weapons, a 10-round magazine limit, and universal background checks for all gun sales. He emphasized protecting vulnerable communities and urged Congress to act, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan also includes measures to improve school safety, mental health services, and federal information sharing. Obama signed 23 executive actions, sparking criticism from Republicans and gun-rights advocates, who accused him of overstepping and targeting lawful citizens rather than addressing root causes of violence. Critics, including Sen. Marco Rubio and the NRA, argue the proposals infringe on Second Amendment rights and fail to focus on criminals and the mentally ill. The plan also faces opposition from lawmakers and local officials, with the NRA launching an ad campaign against it. Despite criticism, Obama stressed the importance of taking action to prevent future tragedies.
