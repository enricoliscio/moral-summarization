SUMMARY: President Obama urged new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of a gun control plan. Facing opposition from gun rights advocates and lawmakers, he called for addressing the pervasive violence in entertainment and video games, though his plan did not address these issues in depth. The President proposed a range of measures to improve access to mental health services and enhance safety in America's schools. Speaking at the White House, Obama vowed to use the weight of his office to pass the proposals, stating that there is an obligation to try and save lives. He was joined by children who wrote to the White House after the Connecticut mass shooting that left 20 dead. 

Obama's plan includes steps to improve background checks, share information with federal agencies, and improve gun tracing. He also committed to hiring more police officers and addressing gun trafficking. The proposals have received mixed responses from lawmakers, with some accusing Obama of undermining Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, has criticized the plan and called the President an elitist hypocrite. The White House plan also addresses school security, urging Congress to help schools improve emergency plans and hire more resource officers and mental health professionals. 

END OF SUMMARY.
