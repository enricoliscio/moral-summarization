SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, urging Congress to pass legislation to restrict assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He emphasized the moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan includes 23 executive actions, such as improving access to mental health services, enhancing school safety, and requiring criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales. Obama also called for legislation to prohibit armor-piercing bullets and straw purchasing. Critics, including Sen. Marco Rubio, accused the president of trying to undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. However, Obama emphasized the need to act, saying "when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now.... Let's do the right thing." The plan aims to improve safety, prevent massacres, and help law-abiding citizens, while also addressing the real underlying causes of violence.
