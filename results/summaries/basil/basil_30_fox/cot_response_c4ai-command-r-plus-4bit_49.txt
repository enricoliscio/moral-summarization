SUMMARY: President Obama urged new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of his gun control plan. He faced stiff opposition from gun rights advocates and Republican lawmakers. The president's plan did not address the pervasive violence in the entertainment and video game industries in depth, but it did propose measures to improve access to mental health services and safety in America's schools. Obama immediately signed nearly two dozen executive actions unilaterally, including directives for federal agencies to share information with the background check system and for the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes of gun violence. The most controversial elements of the president's proposals are the ones that require congressional action, such as universal background checks for gun shows and private sales, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The administration is committing to these actions despite resistance from local officials and the National Rifle Association, who have criticized the president's stance on gun control. Obama's plan also addresses school security and mental health training for teachers. The response to the president's plan has been mixed, with some lawmakers accusing him of undermining Americans' constitutional right to bear arms, while others support the need to address the underlying causes of gun violence and improve school safety.
