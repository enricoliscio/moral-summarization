SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, including 23 executive actions and several proposals for Congress. The plan includes new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks, improved access to mental health services, and enhanced school safety measures. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence after the Connecticut shooting. The plan has received mixed reactions from lawmakers and gun rights groups, with some criticizing it for not focusing enough on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. The NRA has called the president an "elitist hypocrite" and plans to launch an ad campaign against his proposals. Obama has pledged to use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed, saying that if even one life can be saved, "we've got an obligation to try."
