Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan, but I also have to identify all the morally framed words first. Let me read through the article again to understand the context and pick out the words that carry moral connotations.

The article starts by talking about Obama urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines. "Urging" is a moral term because it's about compelling action for a good cause. Then it mentions a "comprehensive plan to curb gun violence." "Curb" and "violence" are both moral terms, with "curb" implying control for the better and "violence" being a negative action.

Next, the president is facing "stiff opposition" from gun-rights advocates and Republicans. "Opposition" here is a neutral term, but "stiff" adds intensity, which might carry a moral weight depending on context. The article says he called on Congress to pass "major changes to the country's current gun laws." "Major changes" is more about significance than morality, but "gun laws" relate to safety and rights.

Obama also called for legislation to bar armor-piercing bullets and require background checks. "Bar" and "require" are action verbs, but "armor-piercing bullets" are inherently dangerous, so that's a moral issue. "Background checks" are about preventing crime, so that's a moral step.

The president spoke about using "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed. "Weight" here is about influence, which is a moral action in the context of leadership. He said, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." "Obligation" is a strong moral term, showing responsibility.

He mentioned protecting the "most vulnerable among us," which is a clear moral framing. The children involved were "vulnerable" and the president's action is about their protection. The plan includes measures to improve mental health services and school safety, which are both moral goals.

The president signed executive actions, which some lawmakers oppose, saying he's overstepping. "Overstep" is a moral judgment on his actions. The plan includes universal background checks, which is a moral stance against gun proliferation.

Critics like Sen. Rubio accused Obama of undermining the 2nd Amendment rights, which is a moral argument against the plan. Others, like Gov. Perry, argue that the issue is mental health, not gun laws, which is another moral perspective.

Gun-rights groups say the effort is misguided, focusing on assault weapons while most killings are with handguns. This is a moral critique of the plan's effectiveness. The NRA plans an ad campaign calling Obama an "elitist hypocrite," which is a strong moral statement.

The summary needs to include these morally framed words while being concise. I'll make sure to highlight the key moral points: urging, restrictions, comprehensive plan, curb, violence, opposition, legislation, obligation, vulnerable, executive actions, universal background checks, undermine, overstep, misguided, elitist hypocrite, school security, mental health.

Now, putting it all together into a summary that's under 200 words, I'll ensure to include these terms and the main points of the article, focusing on the moral framing as presented.
