SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks to protect the most vulnerable among us. He urged Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the possession and importation of armor-piercing bullets and to require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." He also took 23 executive actions, including measures to improve access to mental health services, improve safety at America's schools, and help law enforcement trace guns from criminal investigations. However, the plan faces stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who accuse Obama of trying to undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. Critics argue that the proposals would not have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook and instead target law-abiding citizens.
