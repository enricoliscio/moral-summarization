SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, including executive actions and legislative proposals. The plan includes new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, background checks for all gun sales, and improved access to mental health services. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence, and he pledged to use his office's influence to pass the proposals. The plan has received mixed responses, with some criticizing it for not focusing enough on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, and others vowing to resist federal action. The National Rifle Association has called the president an "elitist hypocrite" and plans to launch an ad campaign against his proposals. Obama's plan also addresses school security and mental health coverage. Speaker John Boehner has said that House committees will review the recommendations.
