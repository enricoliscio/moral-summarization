SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence in America, including 23 executive actions and several proposals for Congress. The plan includes new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks for gun purchases, and increased access to mental health services. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence after the Connecticut shooting. The plan has received mixed responses, with some lawmakers criticizing it for not focusing on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, while others support the call for universal background checks and increased school security. Obama pledged to use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed, saying that if even one life can be saved, "we've got an obligation to try."
