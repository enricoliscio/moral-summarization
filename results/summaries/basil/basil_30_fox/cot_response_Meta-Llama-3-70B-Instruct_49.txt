SUMMARY:
President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new and tougher assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. He emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan also includes measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. Despite facing opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, Obama vowed to use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed. Critics argue that the plan undermines Americans' constitutional right to bear arms and fails to address the real underlying causes of violence. The president's plan has sparked a heated debate, with some lawmakers and gun-rights groups accusing him of being an "elitist hypocrite." END OF SUMMARY.
