SUMMARY: President Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control plan to curb violence, proposing a ban on assault weapons, a 10-round magazine limit, and universal background checks. He emphasized the need to protect vulnerable communities, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan also includes measures to improve school safety, mental health access, and trace gun trafficking. However, it faces stiff opposition, with critics like Sen. Marco Rubio accusing Obama of undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. Gun-rights groups argue the focus on assault weapons is misguided, as most killings involve handguns. The president's initiative also sparked criticism for involving children in the campaign and for not addressing entertainment violence. Despite these challenges, Obama remains committed to taking action, urging Congress to act now to save lives and do the right thing. END OF SUMMARY.
