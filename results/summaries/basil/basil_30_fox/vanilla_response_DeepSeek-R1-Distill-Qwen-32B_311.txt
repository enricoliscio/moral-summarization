Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying Obama is urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines. He wants a ban on assault weapons and a limit of 10 rounds per magazine. This is part of a 23-step plan without needing Congress. He's pushing for legislation on armor-piercing bullets and background checks for nearly all gun sales. He's using his office's influence to pass these proposals, emphasizing saving lives and protecting vulnerable people. He was with four kids who wrote to him after the Connecticut shooting, which killed 20 children.

The plan doesn't address entertainment or video game violence much but focuses on mental health and school safety. Obama signed several executive actions, like sharing info with background checks, new rules for gun returns, CDC research, and tracing guns. He's also nominating someone to lead ATF. The most controversial parts are the universal background checks, which would include gun shows and private sales, with some exemptions. He wants $4 billion for police and new laws against straw purchasing.

Lawmakers are mixed. Rubio says Obama is targeting 2nd Amendment rights and not focusing enough on criminals and the mentally ill. Reid says all options are on the table. Perry says the issue is mental illness, not guns. Gun rights groups argue the measures are misguided since most killings are with handguns. The NRA is against it and plans an ad campaign. The White House plan includes school security measures and mental health training. Boehner won't comment yet.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting the key points: the restrictions, background checks, executive actions, opposition, and the plan's components. I'll make sure to include the main elements without getting too detailed.
