SUMMARY: President Obama has proposed a range of measures to curb gun violence and protect Americans, particularly the most vulnerable among us. He has called for a tougher assault-weapons ban and restrictions on high-capacity magazines, with a limit of 10 rounds. He also seeks to bar armor-piercing bullets and expand background checks for gun purchases. The president has vowed to use his influence to get these proposals passed, emphasizing the importance of trying to save lives and do the right thing. He was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence after the Connecticut shooting that took the lives of 20 children. The plan also addresses mental health services and school safety, with initiatives to hire resource officers and improve access to mental health professionals. Obama has taken executive action on several measures, including improving the federal background check system and research into gun violence. The most controversial elements, such as universal background checks and restrictions on gun trafficking, will require congressional action. Critics argue that the proposals undermine law-abiding citizens' rights and do not address the underlying causes of violence. Supporters argue that the measures will help keep guns out of the wrong hands and improve safety in schools and communities.
