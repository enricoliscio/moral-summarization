Alright, so the user has provided a detailed query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They've given a news article about Obama's gun control plan and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to understand the two main tasks. The first is to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user has specified that this should be labeled as "STEP 1:" and each word listed with an asterisk. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations, like "urges," "restrictions," "opposition," etc.

Next, the second task is to write a summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I have to ensure that the moral framing from the original text is preserved in the summary.

I should also consider the user's deeper needs. They might be looking for a clear, concise summary that highlights the moral aspects of the issue, possibly for an audience interested in the ethical implications of policy decisions. By preserving the moral framing, the summary will convey the nuances of the debate, showing support and opposition, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader societal issues.

I need to make sure that the summary accurately reflects Obama's plan, the opposition from Republicans and gun rights groups, and the underlying moral arguments on both sides. It's important to balance the summary so it's not biased but rather presents the key points with the moral language intact.

I'll start by reading through the article carefully, noting the morally charged words. Then, I'll craft a summary that weaves these words into a coherent overview, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the essence of the original text.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama proposed a comprehensive gun control plan, urging new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as universal background checks. He faced opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republicans, who criticized his approach as targeting law-abiding citizens and overstepping constitutional rights. Obama emphasized the obligation to act to protect vulnerable communities, particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy. His plan included executive actions to improve background checks, trace guns, and enhance school security, while also proposing funding for police and mental health services. Critics argued that his measures would not prevent mass shootings and that the focus should instead be on addressing mental illness and criminal access to firearms. The plan sparked controversy, with gun-rights groups calling it misguided and the NRA launching an ad campaign against it. Obama remained steadfast, urging Congress to pass legislation to save lives and do the right thing. END OF SUMMARY.
