SUMMARY:

President Obama has unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks for nearly all gun sales. The plan includes 23 steps, with Obama using executive actions to implement some measures without congressional approval. The president urged Congress to pass legislation to restrict armor-piercing bullets, require background checks, and increase funding for police officers and mental health services. The plan also aims to improve school safety and access to mental health services. Obama's proposals have faced opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that the measures infringe on Second Amendment rights and fail to address the root causes of gun violence. The National Rifle Association has launched an ad campaign criticizing Obama's plan, while some lawmakers have expressed mixed reactions to the proposals.
