SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks to help protect the most vulnerable among us. The plan aims to improve access to mental health services, improve safety at America's schools, and prohibit straw purchasing. Obama emphasized that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try" and urged Congress to pass the necessary legislation. The president also took 23 executive actions, including directing federal agencies to share information with the federal background check system and proposing new rules to let law enforcement run full background checks. While some lawmakers and gun-rights advocates have expressed opposition, Obama remains committed to doing the right thing and using "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed.

END OF SUMMARY.
