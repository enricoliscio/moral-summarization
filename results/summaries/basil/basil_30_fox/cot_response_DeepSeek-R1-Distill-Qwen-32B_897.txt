Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Words like "urges," "restrictions," "ban," "limit," "curb," "opposition," "advocates," "proposals," "obligation," "protect," "vulnerable," "act," "right," "constitutional," "undermine," "focus," "massacre," "underlying," "misguided," "killings," "target," "resist," "hypocrite," "critics," "school security," "initiative," "cover," "commit," "prohibit," "straw purchasing," "massacre," "haunt," "terror," "elitist," "hypocrite," "critics," "school security," "initiative," "cover," "commit," "prohibit," "straw purchasing," "massacre," "haunt," "terror," "elitist," "hypocrite," "critics," "school security," "initiative," "cover," "commit," "prohibit," "straw purchasing," "massacre," "haunt," "terror," "elitist," "hypocrite."

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to include these terms where appropriate. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the key points: Obama's call for stricter gun laws, opposition from gun rights groups and Republicans, the focus on background checks, school safety, mental health, and the criticism that the plan doesn't address underlying issues like mental health or entertainment violence. I'll also mention the executive actions taken and the mixed reactions from lawmakers.

**SUMMARY:**

President Obama has proposed a comprehensive gun control plan, urging stricter restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, aiming to curb gun violence. The plan includes 23 executive actions and legislative proposals, such as universal background checks and bans on armor-piercing bullets. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to protect vulnerable populations, particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy. However, the plan has faced criticism from gun-rights advocates and Republicans, who argue it undermines the Second Amendment and fails to address root causes like mental health and entertainment violence. Obama also plans to enhance school security and mental health services, while critics, including the NRA, claim the measures are misguided and ineffective. END OF SUMMARY.
