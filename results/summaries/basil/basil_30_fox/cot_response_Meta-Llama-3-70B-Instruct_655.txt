SUMMARY:
President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. He urged Congress to pass these measures, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The president emphasized the need to protect the "most vulnerable among us" and do the "right thing." However, the plan faces stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that it undermines Americans' constitutional right to bear arms and targets law-abiding citizens instead of addressing the real causes of violence. The president also took 23 executive actions, including measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. The plan's controversial elements will likely spark a heated debate in Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
