SUMMARY: President Obama urged tougher restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of a gun control plan, facing stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers. He called on Congress to pass major changes to current gun laws, including restrictions on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as background checks for gun sales. Obama vowed to use "whatever weight" he has to get these proposals passed, citing an obligation to protect the vulnerable. The president was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence after the Connecticut mass shooting that killed 20 young students. 

The plan includes executive actions, such as improving access to mental health services and school safety, and controversial proposals for Congress, including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines. Lawmakers have given mixed responses, with some criticizing Obama for undermining constitutional rights and not addressing the root causes of violence. The National Rifle Association and local officials have also resisted, claiming the proposals are misguided and an overstep of federal power. 

Obama defended his plan, stating an obligation to protect the vulnerable and do the right thing. He is determined to pass these proposals, despite the challenges ahead.
END OF SUMMARY.
