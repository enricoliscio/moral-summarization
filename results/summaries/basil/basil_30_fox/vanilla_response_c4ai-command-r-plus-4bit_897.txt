SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence in America, including executive actions and proposals for Congress. The plan includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks, and improved access to mental health services. Obama also signed nearly two dozen executive actions, such as improving information sharing for background checks and researching gun violence. The plan has received mixed responses from lawmakers, with some supporting it and others criticizing it for undermining the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association has also criticized the plan and plans to launch an ad campaign against it. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence and urged Congress to act to protect America's children. The plan also addresses school security and mental health training for teachers.
