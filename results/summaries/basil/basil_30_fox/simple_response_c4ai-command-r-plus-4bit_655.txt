SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, including executive actions and proposed legislation. The plan includes a tougher assault-weapons ban, a limit on high-capacity magazines, and background checks for all gun sales. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence after the Connecticut shooting, and he emphasized the moral obligation to protect the vulnerable. The plan also addresses mental health services and school safety. Obama's proposals face mixed responses, with some lawmakers criticizing the focus on gun control rather than addressing underlying issues such as violence in entertainment. Gun-rights groups argue that most killings are committed with handguns, not assault weapons. The National Rifle Association plans to launch an ad campaign against Obama's proposals. The White House plan also addresses school security and mental health coverage. Some lawmakers have warned Obama against overstepping his bounds with executive actions. Obama pledges to use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed, emphasizing the moral imperative to save lives and do the right thing.
END OF SUMMARY.
