SUMMARY:
President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. He urged Congress to pass legislation to bar armor-piercing bullets and require background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." He also took 23 executive actions, including measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. Critics, including Sen. Marco Rubio, accused Obama of trying to "undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms" without focusing on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. The president's plan has sparked controversy, with some calling it a necessary step to protect the vulnerable, while others see it as an attack on the right to bear arms. END OF SUMMARY.
