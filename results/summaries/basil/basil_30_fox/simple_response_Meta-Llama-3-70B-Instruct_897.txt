SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. He also proposed legislation to bar armor-piercing bullets and require background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." He was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting. The plan also includes measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. While some lawmakers and gun-rights advocates have expressed opposition, Obama remains committed to using his executive power to push for change. As he said, "Let's do the right thing."
