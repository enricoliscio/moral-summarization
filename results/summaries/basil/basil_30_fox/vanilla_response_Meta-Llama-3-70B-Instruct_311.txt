SUMMARY:

President Obama has unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, including a new ban on assault weapons and a 10-round limit on magazines. The plan includes 23 steps, with 17 requiring congressional action. Obama called on Congress to pass legislation to ban armor-piercing bullets, require background checks for nearly all gun sales, and impose stricter penalties for gun trafficking. He also signed 23 executive actions, including measures to improve mental health services, enhance school safety, and trace guns from criminal investigations. The plan has sparked opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that it infringes on Second Amendment rights and fails to address the root causes of gun violence. The National Rifle Association has launched an ad campaign criticizing the plan, while some lawmakers have vowed to resist federal action.
