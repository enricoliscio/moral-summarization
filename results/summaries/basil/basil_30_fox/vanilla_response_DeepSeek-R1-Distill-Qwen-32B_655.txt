Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Obama urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of his gun control plan. He took 23 steps without congressional action. Key points include a ban on assault weapons, a 10-round limit on magazines, and a call for background checks on nearly all gun sales. He also wants to prohibit armor-piercing bullets. 

Obama addressed this at the White House, emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable people and save lives. He was joined by children affected by the Connecticut shooting, which might have been a bit controversial but shows his focus on the issue. 

The plan includes improving mental health services and school safety, which are important aspects. He signed several executive actions, like sharing information for background checks and researching gun violence causes. However, some lawmakers criticized him for overstepping and not addressing the real causes of violence, like mental illness. 

The NRA is against the plan, calling it misguided, especially since most gun crimes involve handguns, not assault weapons. Some local officials and the NRA are resisting the measures. 

Overall, the summary should cover the main proposals, the opposition, and the context of the plan. I need to condense this into 200 words, making sure to include key elements like the ban, background checks, mental health initiatives, and criticisms. I'll structure it to first outline the plan, then mention the opposition, and conclude with the broader context.
