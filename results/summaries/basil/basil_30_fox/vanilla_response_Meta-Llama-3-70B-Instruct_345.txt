SUMMARY:

President Obama has unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence in the US, including a ban on assault weapons and a 10-round limit on magazines. The plan consists of 23 steps, with 17 requiring Congressional approval. Obama called on Congress to pass legislation to restrict semi-automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines, and armor-piercing bullets, and to require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales. He also signed 23 executive actions, including measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. The plan has been met with opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that it infringes on Second Amendment rights and fails to address the root causes of gun violence. The National Rifle Association has launched an ad campaign criticizing the plan, while some lawmakers have vowed to resist federal action.
