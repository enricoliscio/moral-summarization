Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts with Obama urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines. He wants a 10-round limit and a comprehensive plan with 23 steps. He's facing opposition from gun-rights groups and Republicans. The plan includes background checks, banning armor-piercing bullets, and improving mental health services and school safety.

He signed executive actions, which some lawmakers oppose. The most controversial parts are the universal background checks and the assault weapons ban. Critics like Rubio say it doesn't target criminals or the mentally ill and blames the 2nd Amendment rights. Others, like Reid, are more open. The NRA is against it, and some local officials are resisting.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main points: Obama's plan, opposition, key elements, and the moral aspects like saving lives and protecting vulnerable people. I should keep it under 200 words and use the SUMMARY and END tokens.

Let me structure it: Start with Obama's call, mention the opposition, list the main elements of the plan, note the executive actions and criticism, and end with the moral obligation.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it concise. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like "protecting the most vulnerable" and "doing the right thing."

Now, putting it all together in a summary that's clear and within the word limit.
