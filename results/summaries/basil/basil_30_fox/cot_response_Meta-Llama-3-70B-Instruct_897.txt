SUMMARY:
President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, urging Congress to pass new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The president's plan includes 23 steps, with 10-round limits on magazines and universal background checks. He also called for increased funding for mental health services and school safety measures. Despite opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, Obama vowed to use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed. Critics, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, accused Obama of trying to "undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms" without addressing the root causes of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
