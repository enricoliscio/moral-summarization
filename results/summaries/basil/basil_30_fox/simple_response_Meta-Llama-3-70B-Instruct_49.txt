SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. He also proposed legislation to bar armor-piercing bullets and require background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." He was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence after the Connecticut mass shooting. The plan also includes measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. Despite criticism from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, Obama vowed to use his executive powers to push the proposals forward. The plan's most controversial elements are the proposals requiring congressional approval, including universal background checks and new gun trafficking laws.
