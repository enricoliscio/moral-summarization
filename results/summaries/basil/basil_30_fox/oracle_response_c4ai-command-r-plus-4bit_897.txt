SUMMARY: President Obama has proposed a range of measures to curb gun violence and improve access to mental health services and school safety. Obama has called for new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as background checks for all gun sales. He has also signed executive actions to improve information sharing and tracing of guns used in criminal investigations. The most controversial element of his plan is the proposal for universal background checks, which has faced opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers. Obama argues that if even one life can be saved, then there is an obligation to try and protect the most vulnerable. The plan also includes measures to help schools hire resource officers and mental health professionals and to improve mental health coverage. However, critics argue that Obama is undermining the constitutional right to bear arms and not focusing enough on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. The National Rifle Association has called Obama an "elitist hypocrite" and plans to launch an ad campaign against his proposals.
