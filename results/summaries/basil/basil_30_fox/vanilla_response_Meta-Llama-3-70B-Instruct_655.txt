SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks for nearly all gun sales. The plan includes 23 executive actions, including measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. Obama urged Congress to pass legislation to ban armor-piercing bullets, require background checks, and commit $4 billion to hiring more police officers. The plan has faced opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that it infringes on the Second Amendment and doesn't address the root causes of gun violence. Some lawmakers have vowed to resist federal action, and the National Rifle Association plans to launch an ad campaign against the proposals. Despite the opposition, Obama vowed to use his executive power to push the proposals forward, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try."
