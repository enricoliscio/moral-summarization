SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. The plan includes 23 executive actions, including measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. Obama urged Congress to pass legislation to bar the possession and importation of armor-piercing bullets and to require background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president also nominated Todd Jones to lead the ATF. The plan has faced opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that it infringes on the Second Amendment and fails to address the root causes of gun violence. The NRA plans to launch a major ad campaign against the proposal. House Speaker John Boehner said that House committees will review the recommendations.
