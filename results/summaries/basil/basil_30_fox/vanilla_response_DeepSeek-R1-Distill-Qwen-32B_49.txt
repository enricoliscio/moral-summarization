Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. 

The article mentions that Obama is urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines. He's proposing a ban on assault weapons and a 10-round limit on magazines. These are part of a 23-step plan he's taking without waiting for Congress. 

He also wants Congress to pass laws on armor-piercing bullets and background checks for all gun sales. He's emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable people and is using his influence to push these proposals. 

There are mentions of four children who wrote to the White House after the Connecticut shooting, and they were present during his speech. The plan doesn't address entertainment and video game violence much but focuses on mental health and school safety. 

Obama signed several executive actions, like sharing info with background checks and researching gun violence causes. The most controversial parts are the background checks and the assault weapons ban. 

Lawmakers have mixed reactions. Rubio accuses Obama of targeting lawful citizens' rights, while Reid says all options should be considered. Others, like Perry, argue that the problem is mental illness, not guns. Gun-rights groups oppose the measures, saying they target the wrong weapons. 

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements: the proposals, the opposition, and the mixed reactions. I'll structure it to cover the main initiatives, the opposition from different groups, and the varied responses from lawmakers. 

I should make sure to include that the plan includes executive actions and legislative proposals, the focus on mental health and school safety, and the criticism from both political and gun-rights sides. 

Let me draft this, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the main proposals, then move to the opposition and reactions, and conclude with the mixed responses. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.
