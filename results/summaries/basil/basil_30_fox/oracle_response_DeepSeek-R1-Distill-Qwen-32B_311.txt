Okay, so I'm trying to help the user with this query. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Obama's gun control plan. The user provided the text and a list of morally framed words that the author used. My task is to create a summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is proposing new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines, along with other measures like background checks and mental health services. He's facing opposition from gun rights groups and Republicans. The article mentions the opposition's arguments, like the NRA's ad campaign and criticism from lawmakers.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: curb, violence, use, saved, protecting, shooting, killed, improve, investigations, prohibit, purchasing, undermine, out, massacre, lawabiding, misguided, killings, help, beef. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary.

I should structure the summary to include the key elements: Obama's proposals, the opposition, and the moral implications. I'll start by mentioning the call to curb gun violence, then list the specific measures he's proposing. I'll note the opposition and their criticisms, using words like undermine and misguided. I'll also highlight the moral obligation to protect vulnerable people and the aim to save lives.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid including too much detail on each point to keep it concise. Also, I should make sure to use the morally framed words in context, so the summary reflects the original article's tone and emphasis.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence includes one or more of the required words without forcing them in awkwardly. I'll check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words. 

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll make sure the summary accurately reflects Obama's plan, the opposition, and the underlying moral arguments presented in the article.

SUMMARY: President Obama has called for new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, urging Congress to pass legislation to curb gun violence. His plan includes a 10-round limit on magazines, bans on armor-piercing bullets, and universal background checks for nearly all gun sales. Obama emphasized the need to protect vulnerable communities and save lives, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan also aims to improve mental health services and school safety, while proposing $4 billion for hiring more police officers and passing new gun trafficking laws to prohibit straw purchasing. Despite these efforts, critics argue the measures are misguided and could undermine the constitutional right to bear arms. Gun-rights groups, including the NRA, oppose the restrictions, claiming most killings involve handguns, not assault weapons. The plan has sparked controversy, with some lawmakers accusing Obama of overstepping his authority. Meanwhile, the administration vows to use its influence to push the proposals forward, calling for action to address the massacre in Newtown and other tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
