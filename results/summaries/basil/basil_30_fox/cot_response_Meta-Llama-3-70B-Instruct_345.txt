SUMMARY:
President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and universal background checks. He emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The president's plan also includes measures to improve access to mental health services and school safety. Despite facing opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, Obama vowed to use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed. Critics, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, accused Obama of trying to "undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms" and targeting law-abiding citizens instead of addressing the root causes of violence. The president's plan has sparked a heated debate, with some calling it a necessary step to protect the vulnerable, while others see it as an elitist and hypocritical move. END OF SUMMARY.
