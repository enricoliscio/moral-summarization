SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, including executive actions and proposed legislation. He called for new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks, and increased access to mental health services. Obama also signed nearly two dozen executive actions, such as improving information sharing and research on gun violence. The plan has received mixed reactions from lawmakers, with some criticizing it for undermining the right to bear arms and not addressing underlying causes of violence. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence, and he pledged to use his influence to pass the proposals. The plan also addresses school security and mental health coverage. The most controversial elements are the proposals for Congress, including background checks and gun trafficking laws. The NRA has criticized the plan, and local officials have vowed to resist federal action.
