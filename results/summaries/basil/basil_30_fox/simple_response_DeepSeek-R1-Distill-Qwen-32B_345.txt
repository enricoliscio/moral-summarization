Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Obama is proposing new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He's also pushing for universal background checks, which includes gun shows and private sales. He's taking some actions without Congress, like executive orders, which is causing some pushback.

The moral angle here is about saving lives, especially children, and preventing future tragedies like Sandy Hook. Obama emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable people and act now. There's also criticism from Republicans and gun-rights groups, who argue that his measures infringe on the Second Amendment and don't address the real issues like mental health or criminals getting guns.

I should highlight Obama's main proposals, the opposition, and the moral imperative he's presenting. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements without getting too detailed.

Let me structure the summary: start with Obama's plan, mention the specific restrictions, the opposition, and the moral arguments on both sides. Make sure to include the quotes that show the emotional weight, like saving lives and the criticism about targeting law-abiding citizens.

I should also note the executive actions he took and the mixed reactions from lawmakers. Maybe mention the $4 billion for police and new trafficking laws. Also, touch on the NRA's response and the focus on school security and mental health.

Okay, putting it all together concisely, ensuring the moral framing is clear. I need to balance the details without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control plan, urging new restrictions on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and armor-piercing bullets, while advocating for universal background checks and stricter gun trafficking laws. Despite facing opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republicans, Obama emphasized the moral obligation to act to prevent gun violence, particularly to protect vulnerable populations like children. He signed 23 executive actions, including measures to improve federal data sharing and mental health research, while also proposing $4 billion for police and school safety initiatives. Critics, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, argue the plan oversteps constitutional rights and fails to address criminal access to firearms. The NRA and other groups have condemned the measures as ineffective, focusing on assault weapons rather than handguns, which account for most gun deaths. Obama's plan also includes school security improvements and mental health support, though it does not address entertainment violence. The president's moral appeal for action to save lives has sparked mixed reactions, with some supporting the effort while others accuse him of targeting law-abiding citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
