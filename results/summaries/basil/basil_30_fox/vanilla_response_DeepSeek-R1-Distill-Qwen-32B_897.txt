Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

Okay, the article starts by saying Obama is urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines. He wants a 10-round limit on magazines. This is part of a comprehensive plan with 23 steps he's taking without waiting for Congress. He's pushing for legislation on several fronts: banning semi-automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines, armor-piercing bullets, and universal background checks. He's also using his executive power to implement some measures, like sharing info with background check systems and researching gun violence causes. Plus, he's nominating someone to lead the ATF.

There's a lot of opposition from gun rights groups and Republicans. They argue that his plan doesn't focus enough on keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. Some lawmakers, like Rubio, say the plan targets lawful citizens instead of real issues. The NRA is against it too, pointing out that most homicides are with handguns, not assault weapons. Local officials might resist federal actions, and the NRA is planning an ad campaign against Obama.

Obama's plan also includes improving school security and mental health services. He's proposing to hire more police and mental health professionals in schools, and to train teachers to recognize mental issues. He's using executive actions to strengthen mental health coverage.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the main elements: the call for restrictions, the 23-step plan, key legislative asks, executive actions, opposition from NRA and Republicans, and the focus on schools and mental health.

I should structure it to first state what Obama is doing, then the opposition, and the other aspects like school security. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.
