SUMMARY:

President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, calling for a new assault-weapons ban, a 10-round limit on magazines, and 23 executive actions to strengthen gun control laws. He urged Congress to pass legislation to bar armor-piercing bullets, require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales, and commit $4 billion to hiring more police officers. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." He was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting. While some lawmakers and gun-rights advocates oppose the plan, Obama vowed to use his office's "whatever weight" to get it passed, arguing that it's a moral imperative to protect the most vulnerable among us. The plan also addresses mental health services, school safety, and research on gun violence causes.
