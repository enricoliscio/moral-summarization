SUMMARY: President Obama has proposed a range of measures to curb gun violence in America, including new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Obama's plan includes steps he can take without congressional approval, such as improving mental health services and school safety, as well as proposals for Congress to pass, such as universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on armor-piercing bullets. The president is facing strong opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue that his proposals infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms and will not effectively address gun violence. Obama, however, believes that any action that can save lives is worth taking and has vowed to use his influence to get the proposals passed. The plan also includes measures to improve mental health services and school safety, as well as a commitment to hiring more police officers. The NRA has criticized the plan and plans to launch an ad campaign against it, while local officials have also vowed to resist federal action. The White House's proposal addresses school security and mental health issues, but it has faced criticism for not addressing violence in entertainment and video games. Overall, Obama's plan aims to reduce gun violence and improve safety in America, but it faces significant opposition and debate over the best approach to achieve these goals. END OF SUMMARY.
