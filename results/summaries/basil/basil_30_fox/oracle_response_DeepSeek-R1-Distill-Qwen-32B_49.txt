Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. My goal is to create a concise summary under 200 words that captures the essence of Obama's gun control plan and the moral language used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is proposing several measures, including a ban on assault weapons, limiting magazine capacity, background checks, and funding for police. He's also addressing mental health and school safety. There's opposition from Republicans and gun-rights groups, who argue the measures don't target criminals and might infringe on rights.

Next, I'll identify the key morally framed words: curb, violence, saved, protecting, killed, improve, prohibit, undermine, massacre, misguided, help, beef. I need to ensure these words are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting Obama's calls for restrictions, the opposition, and the focus on vulnerable groups. I'll mention the executive actions and the mixed reactions from lawmakers and gun-rights groups. It's important to convey the moral obligation to act and the criticism that the measures might not address the root causes.

I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, covering the main points without exceeding the word limit. I'll also check that the summary includes all the required moral terms and reflects the author's framing accurately.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's clear, concise, and meets the user's requirements. Making sure it's under 200 words and includes all necessary elements while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama has proposed a comprehensive gun control plan to curb violence, including a ban on assault weapons and a 10-round magazine limit. He urged Congress to pass legislation to prohibit armor-piercing bullets, expand background checks, and restrict straw purchasing. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to protect vulnerable communities, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan also includes funding for police, mental health services, and school safety improvements. However, it has faced criticism, with opponents arguing it undermines the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens and does not address the real causes of violence, such as mental illness. Gun-rights groups claim the measures are misguided, as most killings involve handguns, not assault weapons. Despite opposition, Obama vowed to use his office's weight to push the proposals forward, calling for action to help prevent massacres like Sandy Hook. END OF SUMMARY.
