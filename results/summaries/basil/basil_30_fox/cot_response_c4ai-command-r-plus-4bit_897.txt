END OF STEP 1

SUMMARY: President Obama urged new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of his gun control plan. He faced stiff opposition from gun rights advocates and Republican lawmakers. The plan included steps to address the pervasive violence in entertainment and video games, improve access to mental health services, and enhance school safety. Obama directed federal agencies to share information with the background check system and proposed new rules for law enforcement. He also ordered research into gun violence causes and took steps to commit to official leadership. The most controversial elements are the proposals for Congress, including universal background checks and restrictions on assault weapons and magazines. Obama's plan received a mixed response from lawmakers, with some accusing him of undermining Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. The White House plan addresses school security and mental health issues, urging Congress to take action. Obama also plans to improve mental health coverage through executive action.
