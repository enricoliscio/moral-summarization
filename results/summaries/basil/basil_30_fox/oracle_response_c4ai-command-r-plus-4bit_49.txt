SUMMARY: President Obama has proposed a range of measures to curb gun violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. He has called for stricter restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as universal background checks for gun purchases. Obama also wants to improve access to mental health services and school safety, and has already taken 23 executive actions without congressional approval. The plan includes steps to help schools hire resource officers and mental health professionals and improve training for teachers. The most controversial elements of the plan are the proposed restrictions on law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms, with many gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers criticizing the plan as an attempt to undermine the 2nd Amendment. However, Obama has vowed to use his influence to get the proposals passed, saying that if even one life can be saved, then we have an obligation to try.
END OF SUMMARY.
