Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Obama urging new restrictions on assault weapons and magazines as part of a comprehensive plan. He wants a ban on assault weapons and a 10-round limit on magazines. He also mentioned legislation for armor-piercing bullets and background checks for nearly all gun sales. He used strong language, emphasizing the need to act now to protect vulnerable people.

The president was with four children who wrote to him after the Connecticut shooting, which killed 20 kids. Some criticized involving kids, but they were just there as part of the event. The plan doesn't address entertainment or video game violence much, but focuses on mental health and school safety. He signed several executive actions, which some lawmakers oppose, saying he's overstepping. The most controversial parts are the background checks and the assault weapons ban. Critics like Rubio say it doesn't target criminals or the mentally ill and that it's unconstitutional. Others, like Reid, are open to all options. Local officials and the NRA are against it, planning ads. The plan also includes more police, gun trafficking laws, and mental health support. Boehner says the House will review the plan.

So, the summary needs to cover the main points: Obama's plan includes assault weapons ban, 10-round limit, background checks, executive actions, school safety, mental health, and the opposition. Keep it under 200 words, concise, and include the key elements without too much detail.
