SUMMARY: In an effort to curb gun violence, President Obama has proposed a range of measures, including new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Despite facing opposition, Obama has urged Congress to pass these measures, emphasizing the importance of saving lives and protecting the vulnerable. The plan includes 23 steps that the president can take without congressional action, such as improving access to mental health services and school safety, as well as proposals that require congressional approval, such as universal background checks and a ban on armor-piercing bullets. Obama has pledged to use his influence to get these proposals passed, stating that it is the right thing to do. The plan has received mixed responses, with some criticizing it for not focusing enough on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, while others have vowed to resist federal action. The National Rifle Association has also criticized the plan and plans to launch an ad campaign against it. Obama's plan addresses school security and proposes initiatives to help schools hire resource officers and mental health professionals. He also plans to improve mental health coverage via executive action. The most controversial elements of the plan are the proposals to Congress, including background checks and restrictions on certain weapons and magazines.
