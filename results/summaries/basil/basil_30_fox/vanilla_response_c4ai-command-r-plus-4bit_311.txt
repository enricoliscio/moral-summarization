SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, including executive actions and legislative proposals. He called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks, and increased access to mental health services. Obama also signed 23 executive actions, including improving information sharing and research on gun violence. The plan has received mixed responses from lawmakers, with some supporting it and others criticizing it for undermining the right to bear arms. The National Rifle Association has called the plan misguided and plans to launch an ad campaign against it. Obama was joined by children who wrote to the White House about gun violence, and he emphasized the need to protect the vulnerable. He pledged to use his influence to get the proposals passed, saying, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try."
