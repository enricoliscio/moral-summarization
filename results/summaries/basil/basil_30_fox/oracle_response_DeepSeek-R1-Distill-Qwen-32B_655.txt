Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control plan while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author uses words like "curb," "violence," "saved," "protecting," etc., so I need to include those in the summary.

Obama is proposing new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He wants Congress to pass legislation on background checks, armor-piercing bullets, and other measures. He's also taking executive actions, like sharing info for background checks and researching gun violence. There's opposition from Republicans and gun-rights groups, who argue his plan doesn't target criminals or the mentally ill and might infringe on the Second Amendment.

I should structure the summary to include these points, using the moral terms. I'll start with Obama's call for restrictions, mention the opposition, and touch on the executive actions. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Obama has called for new restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence, urging Congress to pass legislation to protect the vulnerable. He emphasized the need to save lives and act now, proposing universal background checks, bans on armor-piercing bullets, and improved school safety measures. Despite opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, who argue the plan undermines the Second Amendment and does not address underlying causes of violence, Obama has taken executive actions to strengthen background checks and research gun violence. Critics, including Sen. Marco Rubio and the NRA, claim the measures are misguided, as most killings involve handguns, not assault weapons. The plan also includes funding for police, mental health services, and school safety. Obama's efforts to protect and save lives have sparked debate over balancing public safety with constitutional rights. END OF SUMMARY.
