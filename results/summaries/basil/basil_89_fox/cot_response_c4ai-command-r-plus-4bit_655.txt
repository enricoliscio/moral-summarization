SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his post on January 1, 2019, moving up his departure date by several weeks. This decision comes just days after Mattis' *resignation* letter, which highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. The early departure of Mattis, a respected figure in Washington, signals the escalating *tensions* within the Defense Department and the administration. Sources indicate that Mattis' *resignation* was "in *protest*" of Trump's national security policies, particularly the decision to withdraw all 2,000 troops from Syria. This move has drawn criticism, with concerns about abandoning Kurdish allies and the potential re-emergence of ISIS. The *resignation* of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, further underscores the discord within the administration. Trump, however, has downplayed these developments, stating that withdrawing troops from Syria was a campaign promise. He has also framed the decision as bringing troops home "*happy* and *healthy*," despite critics viewing it as a "*hit*" by the media. The White House's plan to reduce troop presence in Afghanistan by half has also faced similar opposition. These developments highlight the ethical dilemmas and *sacrifices* faced by the Trump administration in foreign policy decision-making.
