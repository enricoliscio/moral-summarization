SUMMARY: President Trump announced on Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, 2019, earlier than the previously planned departure date of February 28, 2019. Trump appointed Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan to serve as Acting Secretary of Defense. Mattis' resignation came as a surprise, with his letter citing policy disagreements with the White House. Tensions have risen in the Defense Department and Washington following the resignation. The Trump administration is also planning to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria, a decision that has faced criticism. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned over the Syria decision. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, stating that he did not know him and that the media was exaggerating the significance of the event. The White House's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also faced criticism.
END OF SUMMARY.
