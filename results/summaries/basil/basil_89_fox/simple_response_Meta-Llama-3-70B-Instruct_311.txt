SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned, following Mattis' resignation letter citing policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis had said he would remain in his role until February, but the departure date was apparently moved up. The move comes amid tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources saying Mattis quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies. The news follows Trump's decision to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, despite warnings from military leaders that ISIS could re-emerge. The moral implications of Trump's actions are clear: abandoning allies, ignoring expert advice, and prioritizing personal interests over national security.

END OF SUMMARY.
