SUMMARY: In a shocking move, President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving his post early, just days after Mattis' scathing resignation letter exposed deep policy disagreements. Mattis' departure comes amid escalating tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources indicating that Mattis' resignation was "in protest" of Trump's national security policies. The decision to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria and half of the troops from Afghanistan has sparked fierce criticism, with many arguing that it risks the resurgence of ISIS and undermines America's Kurdish allies. Trump, however, remains steadfast, citing his campaign promises and questioning the value of America's role as the "Policeman of the Middle East." The sudden departure of Mattis and the US envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, Brett McGurk, underscores the chaotic nature of Trump's foreign policy decision-making and raises concerns about the future of US national security strategy.
