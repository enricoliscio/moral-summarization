Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary Mattis is leaving earlier than planned. Mattis had initially said he'd stay until February, but now it's January 1. Trump is replacing him with Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing exec. The article mentions that Mattis resigned over policy disagreements, specifically regarding national security policies. There's tension in the Defense Department, and more resignations might be coming.

Then, there's the issue of Trump pulling troops out of Syria, which Mattis and others opposed. Trump believes ISIS is defeated, but critics worry about ISIS resurgence and abandoning allies. Brett McGurk, another envoy, also resigned, citing that the job wasn't done. Trump downplayed this, calling it a "nothing event" and criticized the media.

The summary needs to capture these points: Mattis's early departure, his policy disagreements, the impact on troop withdrawals, McGurk's resignation, and Trump's dismissal of the resignations. I should highlight the moral implications, like the potential consequences of troop withdrawals and the administration's handling of criticism.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements. Let me structure it step by step: start with Mattis's departure, mention the policy disagreements, then the troop withdrawals, McGurk's resignation, and Trump's response. Keep the tone neutral but reflect the moral framing by showing the concerns and criticisms.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, earlier than the previously stated February 28 departure. Mattis, who resigned over policy disagreements, had planned to stay until February to ensure a smooth transition. Trump appointed Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, as Acting Secretary. Tensions in the Defense Department have risen since Mattis's resignation, with sources indicating he quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies. Trump plans to withdraw troops from Syria, despite concerns about ISIS resurgence and abandoning Kurdish allies. Mattis and Brett McGurk, another departing official, opposed the withdrawal, with McGurk citing unfinished work in Syria. Trump dismissed McGurk's resignation as a "nothing event," criticizing the media for exaggerating the situation. The administration's decision to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan has drawn criticism, with concerns over regional stability and the potential consequences of withdrawing support. END OF SUMMARY.
