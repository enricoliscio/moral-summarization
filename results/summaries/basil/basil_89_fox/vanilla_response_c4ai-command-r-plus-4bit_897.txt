SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his administration earlier than planned, with his last day now set for January 1, 2019. This announcement comes just days after Mattis' resignation letter, which highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Patrick Shanahan, the former Boeing executive and current Deputy Secretary of Defense, will be taking Mattis' place. Tensions have been high since Mattis' sudden resignation, with sources indicating that more resignations may follow. The Trump administration's plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan have drawn criticism, with concerns about the resurgence of ISIS and the abandonment of Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing the need for continued work in Syria. President Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, stating that he had neither met nor appointed him.

END OF SUMMARY.
