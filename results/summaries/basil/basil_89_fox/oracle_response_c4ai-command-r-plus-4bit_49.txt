SUMMARY: President Trump announced on Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving his post on January 1, 2019, moving up the original departure date by several weeks. This decision comes just days after Mattis' resignation letter, which highlighted his policy disagreements with the White House. The early departure signals the skyrocketing tension within the Defense Department and Washington. In his resignation, Mattis emphasized his accomplishments in serving the nation and protecting its interests. His departure is one of several recent resignations, with Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigning in protest of Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, but faced fierce criticism for his decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, a move that could sacrifice the gains made in combating ISIS and leave Kurdish allies abandoned. Trump's decision has been criticized for potentially allowing ISIS to reemerge and for escalating an already devastating war. The President, however, maintains that bringing troops home was a campaign promise and that America should not be the "Policeman of the Middle East." The early departure of Mattis and the ongoing tensions highlight a challenging time for the Defense Department and the nation's foreign policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
