SUMMARY: President Trump announced on Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving his administration earlier than planned, with tensions running high following Mattis' resignation letter citing policy disagreements. Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, will be taking his place as Acting Secretary of Defense. Mattis' resignation, the first by a Cabinet official in 40 years due to policy differences, came amidst Trump's controversial decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Trump defended his decision, citing his campaign promises and questioning America's role as the "Policeman of the Middle East." The resignation of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition to defeat ISIS, further highlighted the backlash to Trump's foreign policy decisions. Despite criticism, Trump stood firm, arguing that the media was blowing the issue out of proportion and that withdrawing troops was in the best interest of America.
END OF SUMMARY.
