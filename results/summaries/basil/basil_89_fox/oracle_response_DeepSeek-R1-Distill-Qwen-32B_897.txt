Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Defense Secretary Mattis resigning earlier than planned, just days after his resignation letter revealed policy disagreements with Trump. Trump appointed Patrick Shanahan as acting secretary. There's tension in the Defense Department, and more resignations might follow. Mattis quit over national security policies, including plans to pull troops out of Syria, which military leaders warned could let ISIS reemerge and abandon Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk also resigned, criticizing the decision. Trump downplayed the resignations, calling them a "nothing event" and criticized the media. The article also mentions plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, which has been controversial.

Now, I need to create a summary using as many of the provided moral words as possible. I should make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes the key points with the moral framing.

I'll start by mentioning Mattis' early resignation and the tension it caused. Then, note Trump's appointment of Shanahan. Highlight Mattis' reasons for resigning, using words like "defeated," "sacrifice," and "abandoning." Mention McGurk's resignation and Trump's dismissal of it. Include the plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, emphasizing the moral implications like "escalating war" and "troop deaths." Make sure to include words like "articulated," "protected," "resignations," "downplayed," and "decimating."

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Mattis' resignation, the reasons behind it, the impact on the administration, and the broader implications of the troop withdrawals. I'll ensure each sentence includes the moral framing words where appropriate without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to hit all the key points and include the necessary moral terms.
