SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his position earlier than expected, on January 1, 2019, replacing him with Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan. Mattis' resignation came as a result of policy disagreements with the White House, specifically regarding the decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Mattis, in his resignation letter, cited his commitment to ensuring the Department's interests are protected and articulated. The early departure of Mattis comes amidst skyrocketing tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources indicating that more resignations may follow. U.S. officials have stated that the Trump administration plans to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria, a decision that Trump defends, arguing that ISIS has been defeated. This decision has faced criticism, with concerns raised about the reemergence of ISIS and the abandonment of Kurdish allies. The White House's plan to halve troops in Afghanistan has also been met with similar concerns. Trump, however, stands by his decisions, emphasizing the sacrifices made and his commitment to bringing troops home. The article concludes by noting the deaths of American soldiers in these conflicts and Trump's consideration of troop deaths in his decision-making process.
END OF SUMMARY.
