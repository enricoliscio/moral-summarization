SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his position earlier than planned, on January 1, 2019, with Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan taking his place. Mattis' resignation letter revealed policy *disagreements* with the White House, particularly regarding Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Sources indicate that Mattis *quit in protest* over Trump's national security policies. The decision to leave Syria has sparked *fierce blowback*, with critics arguing that it will lead to the re-emergence of ISIS and the abandonment of Kurdish allies. Meanwhile, the White House's plan to reduce troops in Afghanistan by half has also faced criticism. Trump has defended his decisions, stating that America should not be the "Policeman of the Middle East", and that bringing troops home healthy is a sacrifice worth making. The sudden departure of Mattis has caused *tensions to skyrocket* in the Defense Department and Washington. This was further exacerbated by the resignation of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, who also left earlier than planned. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, calling him a "grandstander". The withdrawals and resignations highlight the *crazy* moral *disagreements* within the administration and the potential consequences for U.S. foreign policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
