Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about James Mattis resigning from his position as Defense Secretary earlier than expected. Trump announced that Patrick Shanahan would take over as Acting Secretary. Mattis had planned to stay until February, but his departure is now set for January 1. There's tension in the Defense Department, and sources say Mattis resigned in protest over Trump's national security policies. More resignations might follow.

Trump is planning to pull troops out of Syria, which he says is because ISIS has been defeated. However, military leaders warned that ISIS could reemerge, and there are concerns about abandoning Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy, also resigned, citing that the work in Syria isn't done. Trump downplayed this, calling it a "nothing event" and blamed the media for making a big deal out of it.

Additionally, Trump's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has drawn criticism. The U.S. has had troops there since 2001, and over 2,400 soldiers have died. Trump mentioned that troop deaths were on his mind when making the decision.

Now, I need to create a summary using the morally framed words provided. The words include: accomplishments, serving, articulated, protected, tension, skyrocketed, resignations, defeated, sacrifice, combat, escalating, war, reemerging, abandoning, defeat, downplayed, making, decimating, bring, hit, died, deaths.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Let me outline the key points:

1. Mattis resigns earlier than planned, causing tension and potential more resignations.
2. Trump replaces him with Shanahan, highlighting his accomplishments.
3. Mattis' departure due to policy disagreements, specifically over national security.
4. Trump's decision to pull troops from Syria, claiming ISIS defeated, but concerns about reemergence and abandoning allies.
5. McGurk's resignation, emphasizing that the work isn't done.
6. Trump downplaying the resignations, calling them a "nothing event."
7. Plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, despite the cost in lives.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without forcing them. Let me start drafting:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave earlier than planned, weeks before the expected date. This comes after Mattis' resignation letter highlighted his policy disagreements with the administration. Patrick Shanahan, with a long list of accomplishments, will take over as Acting Secretary. Tension in the Defense Department has skyrocketed following Mattis' decision, with sources suggesting he resigned in protest over Trump's national security policies. This has led to speculation about more resignations.

Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, claiming ISIS has been defeated, has sparked concerns about the reemergence of the group and abandoning Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy, also resigned, emphasizing that the work in Syria isn't yet done. Trump downplayed the resignations, calling them a "nothing event" and criticized the media for exaggerating the situation.

Furthermore, Trump's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, where over 2,400 American soldiers have died since 2001, has drawn criticism. The decision, which aims to bring troops home, has been hit by concerns over the impact on the region's stability and the sacrifices made by U.S. forces.

I think this covers all the key points and incorporates the moral words effectively. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.
