Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the ethical and policy implications discussed in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Defense Secretary Mattis's early resignation, the replacement by Patrick Shanahan, the planned troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, and the reactions to these decisions.

I notice that the article highlights policy disagreements, particularly over national security. Mattis's resignation is framed as a protest against Trump's policies, which adds a moral dimension. The user wants the summary to maintain this framing, so I should emphasize the tension and the implications of these decisions.

Next, the planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan are significant. The article mentions concerns about ISIS resurgence and abandoning allies, which are moral issues. Trump's justification for these actions is based on campaign promises and reducing America's role as a global policeman, but critics argue this could lead to instability.

I need to include the reactions from Trump, like his dismissal of the resignations and criticism of the media. This shows a clash between Trump's priorities and traditional foreign policy views, which is a key moral point.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Mattis's early departure and Shanahan's replacement, then move on to the troop withdrawals and the associated criticisms. I'll conclude with Trump's defense of his decisions, highlighting the ethical debate.

I must keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but ensure all critical points are covered. I'll avoid technical jargon to maintain clarity.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the moral aspects like policy disagreements, national security concerns, and Trump's rationale. I'll end with the ethical debate over the administration's approach.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary James Mattis announced his resignation on December 20, 2018, effective January 1, 2019, weeks earlier than his previously stated February departure. This decision came after Mattis expressed policy disagreements with the Trump administration. President Trump appointed Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, as Acting Secretary of Defense. Mattis's abrupt resignation and Shanahan's appointment have raised concerns about growing tension within the Defense Department. The administration's plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan has faced criticism, with concerns over ISIS resurgence, abandoning Kurdish allies, and the impact on regional stability. Trump has defended his decisions, citing campaign promises and questioning the value of maintaining a long-term military presence. The resignations of Mattis and Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition against ISIS, have been framed as protests against Trump's national security policies. Trump dismissed the significance of these departures, attributing them to political grandstanding and media sensationalism. The situation highlights a broader ethical debate over the administration's approach to foreign policy and national security. END OF SUMMARY.
