SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his position on January 1, 2019, earlier than the previously planned departure date of February 28, 2019. Patrick Shanahan, the current Deputy Secretary of Defense and former Boeing executive, will assume the role of Acting Secretary of Defense. Mattis' resignation comes amidst tension in the Defense Department and follows his bombshell resignation letter, which highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Sources indicate that Mattis' resignation was "in protest" of Trump's national security policies. The announcement also comes after news that the Trump administration plans to withdraw all 2,000 troops from Syria and half of the troops from Afghanistan, drawing criticism and concerns about abandoning allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing that the work in Syria was not yet done. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, stating that he had neither met nor appointed him.
END OF SUMMARY.
