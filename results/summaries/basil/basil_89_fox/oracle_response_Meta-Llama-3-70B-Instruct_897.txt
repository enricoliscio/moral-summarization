SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, following Mattis' resignation letter that highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, amid skyrocketing tension in the Defense Department and Washington. Sources suggest that Mattis quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies, which could lead to more resignations. Trump has stood by his decision to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, despite fierce blowback, arguing that America's role as "Policeman of the Middle East‚Äù is not worth the sacrifice. The move has sparked concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies and the potential for ISIS to re-emerge. Meanwhile, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, also resigned, citing that ISIS was on the run but not yet defeated. Trump downplayed the news, tweeting that McGurk was a "Grandstander" and that the media was making a big deal out of a "nothing event."

END OF SUMMARY.
