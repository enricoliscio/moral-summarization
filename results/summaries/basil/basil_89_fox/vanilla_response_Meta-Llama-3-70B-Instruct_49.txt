SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned. Mattis had submitted a resignation letter on Thursday, citing policy disagreements with the White House. Trump named Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan as the Acting Secretary of Defense, effective January 1. The sudden departure of Mattis has sparked tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting that more resignations may follow. The news comes as the Trump administration plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, a decision that has drawn criticism from military leaders and politicians. Additionally, Brett McGurk, the US envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, has resigned, citing concerns that ISIS is not yet defeated and US work in Syria is not yet done.
