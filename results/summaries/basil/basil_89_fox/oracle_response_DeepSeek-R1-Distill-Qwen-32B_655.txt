Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is announcing Defense Secretary Mattis's early departure, which was unexpected. Mattis had planned to stay until February but is leaving earlier. Trump is replacing him with Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing exec. Mattis's resignation letter mentioned policy disagreements, and there's tension in the Defense Department. Trump is also pulling troops out of Syria, which has caused criticism. Other officials like Brett McGurk are resigning, and Trump is downplaying the significance. The article uses words like "accomplishments," "serving," "tension," "resignations," etc., which are morally charged.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these words as possible without making it too long. I'll structure the summary to cover Mattis's early departure, the reasons behind it, Trump's response, the impact on troop withdrawals, and the reactions from other officials. I'll also highlight the moral implications like tension, sacrifice, and criticism. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure each key point is covered succinctly while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, earlier than the previously stated February 28 departure date. Mattis, who had planned to remain until February, cited policy disagreements with the White House in his resignation letter. Trump praised Deputy Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, to serve as Acting Secretary, highlighting his "long list of accomplishments." Tension in the Defense Department has skyrocketed since Mattis's unexpected resignation, with sources indicating he quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies. Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, despite concerns about ISIS reemerging and abandoning Kurdish allies, has drawn criticism. Mattis's early departure follows the resignation of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for defeating ISIS, who argued the mission was not yet complete. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, calling it a "nothing event," while emphasizing the "decimation" of ISIS and the need to "bring" troops home. The administration's troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan have sparked debate over sacrifice, security, and U.S. global responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
