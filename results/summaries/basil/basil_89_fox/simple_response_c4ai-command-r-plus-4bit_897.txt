SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration earlier than planned, with tensions running high following Mattis' resignation over policy disagreements. Trump praised Patrick Shanahan, the former Boeing executive and current Deputy Secretary of Defense, as his replacement. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted his commitment to staying on until the end of February to ensure a smooth transition and protect the interests of the Defense Department. However, his departure date was moved up, amid speculation of rising tensions and possible additional resignations. The decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan has sparked criticism, with concerns about the resurgence of ISIS and the abandonment of Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing the ongoing work in Syria. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, but emphasized the popularity of bringing troops home. The early departure of Mattis underscores the chaotic nature of the administration's recent decisions and the potential consequences for national security. 

END OF SUMMARY.
