SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned, after Mattis' resignation letter highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis, who resigned in protest over Trump's national security policies, will be replaced by Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan. The sudden departure comes amid tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting more resignations may follow. The move is seen as a result of Trump's controversial decisions, including the planned withdrawal of 2,000 troops from Syria and 7,000 from Afghanistan, despite warnings from military leaders and concerns about abandoning Kurdish allies. Trump has downplayed the criticism, claiming he has fulfilled his campaign promises and that the US should not be the "Policeman of the Middle East". The moral framing of this event is one of accountability and responsible leadership, with Mattis and others standing up against Trump's impulsive and potentially harmful decisions.
