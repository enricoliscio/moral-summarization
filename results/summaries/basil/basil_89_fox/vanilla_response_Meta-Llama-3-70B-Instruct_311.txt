SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned. Mattis had submitted a resignation letter citing policy disagreements with the White House. Trump tweeted that Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan will assume the role of Acting Secretary of Defense. Shanahan is a former Boeing executive who joined the Pentagon in 2017. The sudden departure of Mattis comes amid tension in the Defense Department and Washington over Trump's national security policies, including the planned pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria. Mattis had quit "in protest" over the president's policies, and more resignations may be coming. Trump has defended his decision to withdraw troops from Syria, despite criticism from military leaders and others.

END OF SUMMARY.
