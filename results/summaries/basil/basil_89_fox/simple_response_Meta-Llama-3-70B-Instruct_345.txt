SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned, following Mattis' resignation letter that highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis' departure is seen as a protest against Trump's national security policies, particularly the decision to pull out 2,000 troops from Syria. Trump has defended his decision, claiming that ISIS has been defeated in Syria, but critics argue that the move will allow ISIS to re-emerge and abandon the US's Kurdish allies. The news comes amid growing tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting that more resignations may follow. The president's decision has been met with fierce criticism, with many seeing it as a reckless and irresponsible move that will have far-reaching consequences.
