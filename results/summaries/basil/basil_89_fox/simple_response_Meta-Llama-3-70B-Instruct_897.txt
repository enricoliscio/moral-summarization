SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned, after Mattis' resignation letter highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis had said he would remain in his role until February 28, but his departure date was apparently moved up. This comes amidst tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting Mattis quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies. The Trump administration is planning to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, despite criticism, and is also planning to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer. The move has sparked concern about abandoning Kurdish allies and allowing ISIS to re-emerge. Trump has downplayed the news, tweeting that he had defeated ISIS in Syria and that the US role as "Policeman of the Middle East" is not worth the sacrifice.

END OF SUMMARY.
