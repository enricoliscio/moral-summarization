Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump announcing that Defense Secretary Mattis is leaving earlier than planned. Mattis was supposed to stay until February, but now he's leaving on January 1. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary, will take over as Acting Secretary. Mattis had some disagreements with Trump's policies, which led to his resignation. 

There's also mention of Brett McGurk resigning as the U.S. envoy against ISIS. He thought the job wasn't done yet. Trump isn't happy about the media attention on this, calling it a "nothing event." The article talks about Trump's plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, which has caused some criticism. Mattis and McGurk's resignations might be due to disagreements over these withdrawals. 

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: Mattis's early departure, Shanahan taking over, Mattis's policy disagreements, McGurk's resignation, Trump's reaction, and the context of troop withdrawals. Also, mention the concerns about ISIS resurgence and abandoning allies. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, earlier than the previously stated February 28 departure. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, will assume the role of Acting Secretary starting January 1. Mattis' resignation, which revealed policy disagreements with the White House, was initially expected to occur in February. The abrupt change in departure date has raised questions about tensions within the administration. Additionally, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition against ISIS, also resigned, citing that the fight against ISIS was not yet complete. Trump dismissed the resignations, calling them overblown by the media. The administration plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, decisions that have sparked criticism due to concerns about ISIS resurgence and abandoning allies. Mattis and McGurk's exits highlight growing dissent over Trump's national security policies. END OF SUMMARY.
