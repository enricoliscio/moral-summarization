SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his position on January 1, 2019, earlier than the previously planned departure date of February 28, 2019. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and former Boeing executive, will assume the role of Acting Secretary of Defense. Mattis' resignation comes amid tension in the Defense Department and the White House, with sources indicating that Mattis disagreed with Trump's national security policies, particularly the decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing the need to continue the work in Syria. Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops, stating that defeating ISIS was his only reason for being in Syria. The White House's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also faced criticism, with concerns about the ongoing threat of the Taliban and ISIS affiliates. The sudden departures of Mattis and McGurk highlight the growing tension within the administration over foreign policy and national security decisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
