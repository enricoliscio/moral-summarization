SUMMARY:
President Trump announced on Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, 2019, moving up his original departure date by several weeks. Mattis' resignation letter, which cited policy disagreements with the White House, sent shockwaves through Washington and the Defense Department. Sources suggest that Mattis' decision was a protest against Trump's national security policies, including the decision to withdraw all 2,000 troops from Syria. This decision has drawn criticism, with concerns raised about the potential re-emergence of ISIS and the abandonment of Kurdish allies. Trump defended his decision, stating that America should not be the "Policeman of the Middle East," and that the troop withdrawal was a campaign promise. The White House's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also faced similar criticism. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned in protest, citing the need to continue the work in Syria. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, calling him a "grandstander." The sudden departure of Mattis and the acceleration of McGurk's resignation highlight the escalating tension and moral dilemmas within the Trump administration's national security policies.
