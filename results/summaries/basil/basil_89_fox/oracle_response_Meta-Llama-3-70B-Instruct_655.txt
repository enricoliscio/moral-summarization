SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, amidst tension and skyrocketing disagreements over policy. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted his differences with the White House, particularly on national security policies. Trump has stood by his decision to pull out of Syria, despite fierce blowback, arguing that America's role as "Policeman of the Middle East" is not worth the sacrifice. However, military leaders have warned that ISIS could re-emerge if the US pulls out, and there is concern about abandoning the US's Kurdish allies. The news comes as Brett McGurk, the US envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing that ISIS was not yet defeated and US work in Syria wasn't yet done. Trump downplayed the news, saying McGurk was appointed by Obama and was supposed to leave in February. The White House's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also drawn criticism, with concerns about the escalating war and the sacrifice of American soldiers.

END OF SUMMARY.
