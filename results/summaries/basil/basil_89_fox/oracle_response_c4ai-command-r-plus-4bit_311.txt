SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his position on January 1, 2019, moving up Mattis' original planned departure date of February 28, 2019. This announcement comes just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter, in which he cited policy disagreements with the White House. Patrick Shanahan, the former Boeing executive and current Deputy Secretary of Defense, will be taking Mattis' place. Tensions have escalated in the Defense Department and Washington following Mattis' resignation, with sources indicating that more resignations may be imminent. The Trump administration's plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan has drawn criticism, with concerns about ISIS re-emerging and abandoning Kurdish allies. Meanwhile, Trump has downplayed the resignation of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, who also cited policy disagreements in his resignation letter. Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops, stating that he had campaigned on this promise and that America's role as "Policeman of the Middle East" was not worth the sacrifice. More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, a fact that Trump cited in his decision to bring troops home.
END OF SUMMARY.
