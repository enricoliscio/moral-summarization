SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving his post earlier than planned, with Patrick Shanahan, former Boeing executive, taking his place as Acting Secretary of Defense. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted policy disagreements with the White House, specifically regarding the decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Mattis' early departure comes amid skyrocketing tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources indicating that more resignations may follow. The Trump administration's decision to withdraw troops has been criticized, with military leaders warning of ISIS re-emerging and concerns about sacrificing the US' Kurdish allies. In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the importance of articulating and protecting the Department's interests. Trump, however, downplayed the significance of the resignations, stating that defeating ISIS was his only reason for being in Syria. The article also mentions the sacrifice of American soldiers who have died in Afghanistan, with troop deaths weighing on Trump's mind in announcing the pullouts.
END OF SUMMARY.
