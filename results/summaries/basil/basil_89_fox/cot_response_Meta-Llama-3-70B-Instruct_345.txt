SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis had said he would remain in his role until February 28, but the departure date was apparently moved up. Tension in the Defense Department and Washington has skyrocketed since Mattis' sudden resignation in "protest" over Trump's national security policies. Trump has stood by his decision to pull out of Syria, despite "fierce blowback" and warnings from military leaders that ISIS could re-emerge. The news comes as the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, with Trump tweeting that "we have defeated ISIS in Syria." Trump downplayed the news of Mattis' resignation and that of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, calling McGurk a "grandstander" and the media "fake."
