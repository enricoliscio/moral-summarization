Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

So, President Trump announced that Defense Secretary Mattis is leaving on January 1, which is earlier than planned. Mattis had said he'd stay until February, but now it's January. Trump is replacing him with Patrick Shanahan, who's been the Deputy Secretary. Mattis resigned because of policy disagreements with Trump, especially regarding national security. There's tension in the Defense Department because of this.

Also, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy against ISIS, resigned earlier than expected. He thought ISIS wasn't defeated yet and the work in Syria wasn't done. Trump downplayed this, saying it's no big deal and that the media is exaggerating.

Trump wants to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. He says ISIS is defeated in Syria, but military leaders warned that ISIS might come back if they leave. There's also concern about abandoning Kurdish allies. In Afghanistan, he plans to withdraw half the troops, which has drawn criticism. U.S. forces there are mainly training and advising, and they rely on U.S. air support. Over 2,400 soldiers have died since 2001.

So, the key points are Mattis's early resignation, Shanahan taking over, policy disagreements, McGurk's resignation, Trump's troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, and the criticism and concerns surrounding these decisions.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should mention Mattis leaving earlier, his reasons, Shanahan as acting secretary, McGurk's resignation, Trump's stance on troop withdrawals, and the criticism.

Let me structure it: Mattis's resignation, reasons, Shanahan's appointment. Then McGurk's resignation and Trump's reaction. Then the troop withdrawals in Syria and Afghanistan, including criticism and concerns.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure all main points are covered without going over the word limit.
