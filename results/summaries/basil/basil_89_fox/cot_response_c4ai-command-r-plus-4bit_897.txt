SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his position earlier than planned, amid moral disagreements and protests over the President's national security policies. Tensions have escalated since Mattis' bombshell resignation letter, which highlighted his moral differences with the White House. Mattis' departure comes after Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, a move that has drawn fierce blowback. The President has downplayed resignations, including that of Brett McGurk, the US envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, as a "nothing event." Trump stands firm, arguing that the sacrifice of American lives as the "Policeman of the Middle East" is unjustifiable. The White House's similar plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also faced criticism. While Trump presents himself as a hero for bringing troops home, the media continues to hit him hard, with Mattis' early departure highlighting the moral tensions within the administration.
