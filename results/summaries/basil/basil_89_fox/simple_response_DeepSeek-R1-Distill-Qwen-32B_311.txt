Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Trump announcing that Defense Secretary Mattis is leaving earlier than planned. Mattis was supposed to stay until February, but now he's leaving on January 1. Trump is promoting Patrick Shanahan to Acting Secretary. There's some tension in the Defense Department because Mattis resigned in protest over Trump's national security policies. Also, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy, resigned as well, citing that ISIS isn't yet defeated and the work in Syria isn't done. Trump downplayed this, saying it's a "nothing event" and criticized the media.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key points: Mattis's early departure, his reasons, the promotion of Shanahan, McGurk's resignation, Trump's reaction, and the context of U.S. troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan. The moral framing is about the administration's decisions on troop withdrawals and the potential consequences, as well as the criticism from the media and Mattis's protest.

I should structure the summary to first mention Mattis's resignation and the change in departure date, then Shanahan's promotion. Then, touch on McGurk's resignation and Trump's dismissal of it. Finally, mention the troop withdrawals and the criticism surrounding these decisions. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspects are clear, like Mattis's protest and the implications of the withdrawals on national security and allies.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, earlier than the previously stated February 28 departure. Mattis, who had planned to stay until February, resigned in protest over Trump's national security policies. Trump appointed Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, as Acting Secretary. The announcement came after Mattis criticized Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, a move Trump defended as fulfilling his campaign promise, despite concerns about ISIS resurgence and abandoning Kurdish allies. Additionally, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition against ISIS, resigned, citing that the fight against ISIS was not yet won. Trump dismissed McGurk's resignation as a "nothing event," criticizing the media for exaggerating the situation. The administration's plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan has faced criticism for potentially weakening U.S. influence and security in the region. END OF SUMMARY.
