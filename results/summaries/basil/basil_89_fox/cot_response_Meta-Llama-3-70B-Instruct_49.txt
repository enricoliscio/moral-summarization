SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter highlighted their policy disagreements. Mattis, who quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies, will be replaced by Patrick Shanahan, a "talented" former Boeing executive. Trump stood by his decision to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, despite "fierce blowback" and concerns about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies. The news comes amid reports of plans to withdraw half the troops in Afghanistan, drawing similar criticism. Trump downplayed the news, calling Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, a "grandstander" and the media "fake". Trump argued that his decisions would make America "happy & healthy" and that he would be a "popular hero" if anyone else had made them. END OF SUMMARY.
