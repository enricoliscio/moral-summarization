SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, following a "bombshell" resignation letter that made clear their policy disagreements. Mattis had quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies, which have drawn "fierce" criticism. Trump has stood by his decision to pull troops out of Syria, despite warnings from military leaders that ISIS could re-emerge. The news comes amid a flurry of resignations, including that of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, who said that ISIS was not yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn't yet done. Trump downplayed the news, calling McGurk a "grandstander" and saying that the media was making a big deal out of a "nothing event!" END OF SUMMARY.
