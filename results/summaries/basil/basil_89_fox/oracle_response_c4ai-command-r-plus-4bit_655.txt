SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his post on January 1, 2019, moving up the previously planned departure date of February 28. This announcement comes days after Mattis' resignation letter, which highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Patrick Shanahan, the former Boeing executive and current Deputy Secretary of Defense, will take over as Acting Secretary. Sources indicate that Mattis' resignation was "in protest" of Trump's national security policies, particularly the decision to withdraw all 2,000 troops from Syria, a move that has faced fierce criticism. Trump defended his Syria decision, arguing that ISIS has been defeated and that America's sacrifice as the "Policeman of the Middle East" is not worth it. This decision comes amid escalating tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with concerns about ISIS re-emerging and abandoning Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing that the work in Syria was not yet done. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, stating that he had neither met nor appointed him. The White House's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also faced similar criticism. Trump's decisions have sparked concern and debate, with many questioning the potential consequences of these moves.
END OF SUMMARY.
