Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about Mattis resigning earlier than planned, which was a surprise because he had announced a later departure date. Trump is replacing him with Patrick Shanahan. There's tension in the Defense Department, and it's mentioned that Mattis quit over policy disagreements, specifically regarding national security policies. Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan is causing concern among military leaders and allies.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key points: Mattis's early resignation, Trump's replacement with Shanahan, the reasons behind Mattis's departure, the troop withdrawals, and the criticism from military leaders. Also, the moral framing involves criticism of Trump's decisions, so I should highlight that.

I should keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly, starting with Mattis's resignation, then Trump's response, the reasons, and the consequences. I need to maintain the critical tone towards Trump's policies and decisions.

Let me start drafting. First sentence: Mattis resigning early, originally planned for February. Trump appoints Shanahan. Mattis's reasons: policy disagreements. Then, Trump's decisions on Syria and Afghanistan, the concerns about ISIS resurgence and abandoning allies. Mention McGurk's resignation and Trump's dismissal of it. Conclude with the criticism of Trump's decisions.

I should make sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go. Okay, that should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral critique.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary James Mattis announced his resignation on December 19, 2018, effective January 1, 2019, weeks earlier than his previously stated departure date of February 28. President Trump replaced Mattis with Deputy Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, who will serve as Acting Secretary. Mattis's resignation came amid tensions over policy disagreements, particularly regarding Trump's national security decisions, including plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Mattis had initially stated he would stay until February to ensure a smooth transition, but his departure was accelerated. Trump defended his decisions, arguing that ISIS had been defeated in Syria and that the U.S. should not remain as the "Policeman of the Middle East." However, military leaders and allies expressed concerns about the potential resurgence of ISIS and the impact on U.S. Kurdish allies. Additionally, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition against ISIS, also resigned, citing that the fight against ISIS was not yet complete. Trump dismissed McGurk's resignation as insignificant, downplaying its importance. The administration's troop withdrawal plans have drawn criticism for prioritizing short-term political gains over long-term security interests. END OF SUMMARY.
