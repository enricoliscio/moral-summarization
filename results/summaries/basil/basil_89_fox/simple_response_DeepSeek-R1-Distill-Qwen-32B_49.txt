Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. 

First, the article talks about Mattis's resignation, which was earlier than expected. The key points are Mattis's policy disagreements with Trump and the implications of his departure. I should highlight that Mattis quit over policy differences, which is significant because it's rare for a Cabinet member to do that.

Next, Trump's response is important. He's downplaying the resignations, calling it a "nothing event" and blaming the media. This shows his dismissive attitude towards criticism, which is part of the moral framing. I should include that to show the tension between Trump and his administration.

Then, the article mentions the withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. Mattis and McGurk's resignations are tied to these decisions. I need to explain that they believe the mission isn't complete, which adds to the moral debate about leaving allies and potential resurgence of ISIS.

Also, Trump's reasoning about not wanting to be the "Policeman of the Middle East" is a key point. It's his justification, but it's controversial. I should note the criticism he's facing for this stance.

Lastly, the broader context of troop deaths and the impact on national security is important. It ties into the moral implications of these decisions beyond just policy.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without losing the moral aspects. I'll structure it by first mentioning Mattis's resignation, then Trump's response, followed by the policy decisions and the criticism they've received. I'll end with the broader implications to wrap it up neatly.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than previously planned. Mattis had initially stated he would remain until February 28, but his departure was moved up amid reports of disagreements over national security policies. Trump praised Deputy Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, to take over as Acting Secretary. Mattis's resignation, described as a protest, has heightened tensions in Washington, with more potential resignations rumored. Meanwhile, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition against ISIS, also resigned, citing that the mission in Syria was not yet complete. Trump downplayed the resignations, dismissing them as a "nothing event" and criticizing the media. The administration's plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan has drawn criticism, with concerns over ISIS resurgence and abandoning allies. Trump justified the withdrawals, emphasizing his campaign promises and questioning the role of the U.S. as the "Policeman of the Middle East." The decisions have sparked debate over national security and U.S. global responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
