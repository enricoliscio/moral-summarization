SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his post on January 1, 2019, weeks earlier than the previously planned departure date of February 28, 2019. The announcement comes days after Mattis' resignation letter, which highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and former Boeing executive, will take over as Acting Secretary of Defense. The early departure of Mattis has heightened tensions in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources indicating that Mattis' resignation was "in protest" of Trump's national security policies. The news follows other recent resignations, including Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, who also resigned earlier than planned. Trump has defended his decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, citing the defeat of ISIS and his campaign promises. Critics argue that the withdrawal may lead to the re-emergence of ISIS and could abandon U.S. allies.
