SUMMARY:
President Trump announced on Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his post on January 1, 2019, moving up the initial departure date by several weeks. This decision comes just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter, in which he cited policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis' early departure underscores the fierce blowback and escalating tension within the Defense Department and Washington. Sources indicate that Mattis' resignation was a protest against the president's national security policies, particularly the decision to withdraw all 2,000 troops from Syria, which Mattis and others believe sacrifices America's Kurdish allies. Trump, however, has downplayed these concerns, stating that defeating ISIS was his only reason for remaining in Syria during his presidency. The White House's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also drawn criticism, with many arguing that it will leave Afghanistan's security forces vulnerable. Meanwhile, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, with his departure accelerated to December 31. Trump dismissed the significance of these resignations, tweeting that if anyone but him made the decision to bring troops home, they would be hailed as a hero. The early departure of Mattis and the resignation of McGurk highlight the moral dilemmas and fierce disagreements within the administration over national security and foreign policy.
