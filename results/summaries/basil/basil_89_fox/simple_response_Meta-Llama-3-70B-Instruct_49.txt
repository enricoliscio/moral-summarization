SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted policy disagreements with the White House, particularly on national security issues. Trump has appointed Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan as Acting Secretary of Defense. The sudden departure of Mattis and US envoy Brett McGurk, who also resigned, has raised concerns about the administration's hasty decisions on Syria and Afghanistan. Trump's decision to pull out troops from Syria and Afghanistan has been met with criticism, with many warning of the risks of ISIS re-emergence and abandoning US allies. The president has downplayed the concerns, touting his campaign promises and claiming that the US has defeated ISIS in Syria. However, his actions have sparked tension within the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting that more resignations may follow.
