SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned. Mattis had submitted a resignation letter citing policy disagreements with the White House. Trump named Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan as the new Acting Secretary of Defense. The sudden departure of Mattis has sparked tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting that Mattis quit in protest over Trump's national security policies. The news comes as the Trump administration plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria and withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer. Trump has defended his decisions, citing his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that America's role as "Policeman of the Middle East" is not worth the sacrifice. The departures of Mattis and Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, have raised concerns about the administration's national security policies.
