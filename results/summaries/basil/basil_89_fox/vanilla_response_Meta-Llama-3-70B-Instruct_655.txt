SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned. Mattis had submitted a resignation letter on Thursday, citing policy disagreements with the White House. Trump named Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan as the Acting Secretary of Defense, effective January 1. The sudden departure of Mattis, who had planned to stay on until February, has raised tensions in the Defense Department and Washington. The move comes amid controversy over Trump's decision to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, which Mattis had opposed. Trump has defended his decision, saying that ISIS has been defeated in Syria and that the US should not be the "Policeman of the Middle East". The news also follows the resignation of Brett McGurk, the US envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, who had criticized Trump's Syria decision.
