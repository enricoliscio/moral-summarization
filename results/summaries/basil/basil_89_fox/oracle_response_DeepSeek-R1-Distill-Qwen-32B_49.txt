Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about President Trump's defense secretary, Mattis, leaving earlier than planned, along with other resignations and policy changes. The user also listed specific morally framed words that the author used, and they want the summary to include as many of these words as possible.

I should start by reading the article thoroughly to grasp the main points. The key events are Mattis's early resignation, the replacement by Shanahan, the context of policy disagreements, the planned troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, and the reactions from Trump and others.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "accomplishments," "serving," "articulated," "protected," "tension," "skyrocketed," "resignations," "defeated," "sacrifice," "combat," "escalating," "war," "reemerging," "abandoning," "defeat," "downplayed," "making," "decimating," "bring," "hit," "died," "deaths." I should make sure to incorporate these words into the summary without forcing them unnaturally.

Now, I'll outline the summary. It should start with Mattis's departure, mention Shanahan's appointment, the reasons for the early resignation, the policy disagreements, and the impact on the Defense Department. Then, it should touch on Trump's Syria and Afghanistan decisions, the concerns about ISIS reemerging and abandoning allies, and the reactions from Trump and others, including the downplaying of the resignations.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including as many of the specified words as possible. I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's content with the moral framing intact.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring that each key point is covered and that the morally framed words are appropriately included. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that the summary accurately reflects the original article's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, amid policy disagreements. Mattis, who had planned to stay until February, reportedly resigned "in protest" over Trump's national security policies. Trump appointed Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, as Acting Secretary, praising his "accomplishments." Tension in the Defense Department has skyrocketed since Mattis' bombshell resignation. Trump plans to withdraw troops from Syria, claiming ISIS has been "defeated," despite concerns about ISIS reemerging and abandoning Kurdish allies. Mattis' early departure follows Brett McGurk's resignation as U.S. envoy to defeat ISIS, who warned the mission wasn't yet complete. Trump downplayed the resignations, calling them "nothing events." The administration also plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, with Trump emphasizing troop deaths and the cost of sacrifice. The article highlights the moral implications of these decisions, including the risk of abandoning allies and the potential resurgence of ISIS. END OF SUMMARY.
