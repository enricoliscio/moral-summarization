SUMMARY:

President Trump announced on Twitter that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned. Mattis had submitted a resignation letter on Thursday, citing policy disagreements with the White House. Trump named Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan as the Acting Secretary of Defense, effective January 1. The sudden departure of Mattis has sparked tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources suggesting that more resignations may follow. The move comes amid controversy over Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, with critics arguing that the moves could lead to the resurgence of ISIS and abandonment of Kurdish allies. Trump has defended his decisions, citing his campaign promises and arguing that the US should not be the "Policeman of the Middle East".
