Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump announcing that Defense Secretary Mattis is leaving earlier than planned. Mattis was supposed to stay until February but now is leaving on January 1. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary, will take over as Acting Secretary. 

Mattis had a resignation letter where he mentioned policy disagreements with the White House. Trump mentioned pulling troops out of Syria, which Mattis might have disagreed with. There's also Brett McGurk, another envoy, who resigned, citing that ISIS isn't fully defeated yet. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, saying he wasn't involved in his appointment.

Additionally, Trump's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan is causing criticism. The U.S. has been there since 2001, and the withdrawal might affect the local security situation. Trump mentioned troop deaths as a factor in his decision.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all the key points: Mattis's early departure, Shanahan taking over, the reasons for Mattis's resignation, McGurk's resignation, Trump's reactions, and the troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan.

I should structure it in a logical flow, starting with Mattis's departure, then Shanahan, the reasons, McGurk's resignation, Trump's response, and the broader implications of troop withdrawals. Make sure to include the main actors and their roles, the policy disagreements, and the consequences of these decisions.

I need to avoid going into too much detail but ensure all key elements are covered. Let me draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and making sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, earlier than the previously stated February 28. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, will act as the new Secretary. Mattis's resignation letter revealed policy disagreements with the White House, particularly over Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which Mattis had initially planned to stay until February. Trump has defended the troop withdrawals, emphasizing the defeat of ISIS and the need to reduce U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Additionally, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition against ISIS, resigned, citing that the mission in Syria was not yet complete. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, attributing it to "Fake News." The administration's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has also faced criticism, with concerns about the impact on local security and the high number of U.S. troop deaths since the 2001 invasion. END OF SUMMARY.
