SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned, after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis had said he would remain in his role until February, but Trump accelerated his departure date. Mattis quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies, which have sparked fierce blowback. Trump stood by his decision to pull troops out of Syria, despite criticism, saying it should come as "no surprise" given his 2016 campaign promises. The news comes as Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, also resigned, saying ISIS wasn't yet defeated. Trump downplayed the news, calling McGurk a "grandstander" and the media "fake". END OF SUMMARY.
