Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary Mattis is leaving earlier than planned, on January 1 instead of February 28. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary, will take over as Acting Secretary. Mattis had disagreements with Trump's policies, especially regarding Syria. Trump wants to pull troops out, but Mattis and others, like Brett McGurk, who also resigned, think it's too soon. The article mentions the impact on U.S. allies and the potential resurgence of ISIS. Trump defends his decisions, saying the media is exaggerating, and that the U.S. has defeated ISIS. There's also mention of troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, which is causing criticism. 

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: Mattis's early resignation, Shanahan taking over, policy disagreements, Syria troop withdrawal, McGurk's resignation, Trump's response, and the Afghanistan plan. Keep it under 200 words, clear and concise. I'll structure it to flow from Mattis's departure, reasons, Trump's stance, and the broader implications.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, earlier than the previously stated February 28 departure. Patrick Shanahan, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, will serve as Acting Secretary starting January 1. Mattis' resignation came amid policy disagreements, particularly over Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which he believes is premature. Trump defended the decision, stating the U.S. has defeated ISIS and the withdrawal was promised during his campaign. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition against ISIS, also resigned, citing that the mission in Syria was not yet complete. Trump downplayed the resignations, calling them "nothing events" and criticized the media for exaggerating the situation. The administration's plans to withdraw troops from both Syria and Afghanistan have drawn criticism, with concerns about the resurgence of ISIS and the impact on U.S. allies. END OF SUMMARY.
