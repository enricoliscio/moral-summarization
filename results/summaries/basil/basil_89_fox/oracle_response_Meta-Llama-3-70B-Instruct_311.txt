SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned, following Mattis' resignation letter highlighting policy disagreements with the White House. Mattis, who resigned "in protest" over Trump's national security policies, had initially planned to stay on until February. The sudden departure has sparked tension in the Defense Department and Washington, with sources hinting at more resignations to come.

Trump has stood by his decision to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, despite fierce criticism, arguing that America's role as "Policeman of the Middle East" is not worth the sacrifice. However, military leaders have warned that ISIS could re-emerge if the US withdraws. The news comes as Brett McGurk, the US envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing concerns that ISIS was not yet defeated and US work in Syria wasn't yet done.

Trump downplayed the news, tweeting that McGurk was a "grandstander" and that he would be a "hero" if anyone else had announced the troop withdrawal. The White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan has also drawn criticism, with concerns about abandoning Kurdish allies and the ongoing war.

END OF SUMMARY.
