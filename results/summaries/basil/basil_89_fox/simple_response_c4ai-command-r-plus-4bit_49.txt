SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave his post on January 1, 2019, earlier than the previously planned departure date of February 28, 2019. This announcement comes just days after Mattis' resignation letter, which highlighted policy disagreements with the White House. The early departure of Mattis, a respected figure in Washington, signals a deepening divide between the White House and those who value longstanding U.S. alliances and a traditional foreign policy approach.

The resignation of Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, has been characterized as a "protest" against Trump's national security policies, including the abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. The Syria decision, in particular, has been criticized as a betrayal of U.S. Kurdish allies and a potential boon to ISIS. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned in protest, citing the premature declaration of victory over ISIS and the unfinished work in Syria. Trump downplayed McGurk's resignation, but his departure, along with Mattis', underscores the concern over the abrupt foreign policy shifts and the potential damage to U.S. interests and alliances. These resignations highlight the moral dilemma faced by those in the administration: to uphold their oath to serve the country and its interests, or to remain loyal to a president whose decisions they believe are detrimental to the nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
