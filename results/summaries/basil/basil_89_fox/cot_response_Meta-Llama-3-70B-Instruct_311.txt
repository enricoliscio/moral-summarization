SUMMARY:
President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, earlier than planned, after Mattis' resignation letter highlighted their policy disagreements. Mattis, who quit "in protest" over Trump's national security policies, will be replaced by Patrick Shanahan, a "talented" former Boeing executive. Trump downplayed the news, saying Mattis' departure was "no surprise" given his 2016 campaign promises. The president also stood by his decision to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, despite "fierce blowback" and concerns about abandoning Kurdish allies. Meanwhile, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned, saying ISIS was on the run but not yet defeated. Trump called McGurk a "grandstander" and the news a "fake" event. END OF SUMMARY.
