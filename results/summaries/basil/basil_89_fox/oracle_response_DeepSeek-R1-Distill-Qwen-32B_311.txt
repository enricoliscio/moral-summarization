Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading the article to understand the main points. 

President Trump announced that Mattis is leaving earlier than planned, which was a surprise because Mattis had planned to stay until February. Mattis resigned due to policy disagreements, especially regarding Syria. Trump is pulling troops out of Syria, which has caused tension and more resignations, like Brett McGurk's. Trump downplayed the resignations, calling it a "nothing event." There's also criticism about the withdrawal from Afghanistan, with concerns about the consequences.

I need to include words like "accomplishments," "serving," "articulated," "protected," "tension," "skyrocketed," "resignations," "defeated," "sacrifice," "combat," "escalating," "war," "reemerging," "abandoning," "defeat," "downplayed," "making," "decimating," "bring," "hit," "died," "deaths."

I'll structure the summary to mention Mattis's early departure, his reasons, Trump's troop withdrawal, the impact on morale, other resignations, and the criticism. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words appropriately without making the summary too long. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than the previously stated February 28 departure date. Mattis, who had planned to stay until February, resigned over policy disagreements, particularly regarding Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Trump praised Deputy Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, as the new Acting Secretary, highlighting his "accomplishments" in his role. Tension in the Defense Department has skyrocketed since Mattis' resignation, with sources indicating he quit "in protest" over national security policies. Trump's plan to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan has drawn criticism, with concerns about ISIS reemerging and abandoning Kurdish allies. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to defeat ISIS, also resigned, citing that the mission wasn't yet complete. Trump downplayed the resignations, calling them a "nothing event." The withdrawals, Trump argued, would bring troops home "happy & healthy," though critics worry about the sacrifices and deaths of soldiers in these conflicts. END OF SUMMARY.
