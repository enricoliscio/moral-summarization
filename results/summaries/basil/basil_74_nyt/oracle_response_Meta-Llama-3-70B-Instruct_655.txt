SUMMARY:

President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a TV comedian, and Democrats on Twitter, sparking a storm of protests. Griffin posed for a video holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump, which was widely deemed "disturbing" and "wrong". She apologized, saying she "crossed the line" and "went too far", and CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve program. The First Lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's sanity, saying the photo was "very disturbing" and made her wonder about Griffin's "mental health". Trump also accused Democrats of trying to "squelch" testimony involving the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, wrote to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to "investigate" the "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. Trump tweeted that Page's testimony would "blow away" the case against him.
