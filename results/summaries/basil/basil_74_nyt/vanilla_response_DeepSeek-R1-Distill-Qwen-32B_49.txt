Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump lashing out at Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump criticized Democrats and Kathy Griffin on Twitter after returning from an overseas trip. He had been quiet on social media during the trip, which is unusual for him. Then, it talks about Kathy Griffin's video where she's holding a fake severed head of Trump, which caused a lot of backlash. She apologized, and CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve show. Melania Trump also criticized her, questioning her mental health. Griffin apologized and said she crossed a line, but didn't address Trump directly. CNN dropped her, and Anderson Cooper distanced himself too.

Then, Trump also criticized Democrats for trying to stop Carter Page from testifying in the Russia investigation. Trump called it a witch hunt. Page wanted to clear his name by testifying about false testimony by Comey and Brennan. The article mentions that Page didn't specify what was false, but urged the committee to investigate collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama officials.

So, the main points are: Trump tweets against Griffin and Democrats, Griffin's offensive video leads to her apologizing and losing her job, Melania Trump condemns her, and Trump accuses Democrats of blocking Page's testimony, calling it a witch hunt.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll make sure to include Trump's actions, Griffin's situation, the apologies, and the political implications with the Democrats and the Russia investigation.

Wait, did I miss anything? The article also mentions that the Trumps had support from others, including the daughter of the woman Trump beat in the election. That's Melania's support, but maybe it's not necessary for the summary since it's more detail.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's tweets, then Griffin's incident, her apology, CNN's decision, Melania's statement, and then shift to Trump's criticism of Democrats and the Carter Page situation, calling it a witch hunt. Also, note that Page wants to testify about false testimony by Comey and Brennan.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll write the summary, keeping it concise and under 200 words.
