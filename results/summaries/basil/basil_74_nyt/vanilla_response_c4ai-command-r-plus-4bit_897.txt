SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to criticize comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats in Congress. Griffin faced backlash for a video in which she held what appeared to be the severed, bloodied head of Trump, leading to her apology and dismissal from CNN's New Year's Eve program. Melania Trump also questioned Griffin's sanity and the appropriateness of the photo. Separately, Trump accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony related to the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, calling it a "witch hunt." He referenced a letter from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, who claimed that Democrats did not want him to testify and provide "accurate information." Page also urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and former Obama administration officials. 

END OF SUMMARY.
