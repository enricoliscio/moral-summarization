Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about President Trump reacting on Twitter after returning from an overseas trip. He's lashing out at Kathy Griffin and the Democrats.

So, the main points are:
1. Trump criticized Kathy Griffin for a video where she held a prop of his severed head. The video caused a lot of backlash, leading her to apologize and CNN firing her.
2. Melania Trump also commented, questioning Griffin's sanity.
3. Griffin apologized, saying she crossed a line and the image was too disturbing.
4. Trump also attacked Democrats for trying to block testimony in the Russia investigation. He accused them of a witch hunt, mentioning Carter Page, who wanted to testify against Comey and Brennan.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's Twitter blasts, the Griffin incident, her apology, CNN's action, Melania's comment. Then move to the Democrats and the Russia investigation part, including Trump's witch hunt accusation and Carter Page's involvement.

I should make sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step.

First, introduce Trump's actions on Twitter. Then detail the Griffin situation, her apology, and the consequences. Next, address the Democrats and the Russia investigation, mentioning the witch hunt claim and Carter Page.

I should keep sentences concise and ensure the flow is logical. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
