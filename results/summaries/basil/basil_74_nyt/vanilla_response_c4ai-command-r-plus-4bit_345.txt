SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to criticize comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats in Congress. Griffin faced backlash for posing with what appeared to be the severed head of Trump, leading to widespread condemnation and her removal from CNN's New Year's Eve program. Melania Trump questioned Griffin's sanity, sparking an apology from Griffin. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to silence Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Page alleged that Comey and Brennan gave false testimony and called for an investigation into Clinton campaign associates. The president labeled the investigation a "witch hunt."
