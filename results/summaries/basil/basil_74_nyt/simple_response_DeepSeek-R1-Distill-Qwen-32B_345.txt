Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. The user mentioned that I should focus on the moral aspects as presented by the author, so I have to be careful not to add my own opinions but just reflect the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump criticizing Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. Griffin made a controversial video where she appeared to hold a bloodied Trump head, which caused a lot of backlash. Trump and his wife criticized her, and CNN fired her. She apologized, saying she crossed a line. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to block testimony in the Russia investigation, calling it a witch hunt.

Now, I need to identify the moral framing here. The article seems to present Trump's perspective as justified in criticizing Griffin for her offensive behavior and the Democrats for obstruction. It also shows Griffin's apology and the consequences she faced, which adds a moral dimension about crossing lines and accountability. The Democrats are portrayed as part of a witch hunt, which is a moral accusation against them.

I should make sure the summary includes these elements: Trump's criticism of Griffin, her apology, the consequences (like CNN firing her), Trump's accusations against Democrats, and the context of the Russia investigation. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and focus on the moral aspects without adding my own judgments.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Trump condemns Griffin, her video causes outrage, she apologizes, CNN fires her, Melania Trump comments on her sanity, Trump also criticizes Democrats for blocking testimony, calling it a witch hunt, and Carter Page's involvement in the investigation.

Now, I'll structure this into a coherent summary, making sure to highlight the moral elements as presented. I'll keep each sentence focused and ensure the flow is logical.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. The summary should start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure it's within the word limit by being concise but comprehensive.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Kathy Griffin for a controversial video depicting her holding a bloodied Trump head, sparking widespread outrage. Griffin apologized, admitting she crossed a line and regretted the offensive imagery. CNN fired her from its New Yearâ€™s Eve show, and Melania Trump questioned her sanity. Trump also accused Democrats of obstructing testimony in the Russia investigation, calling it a "witch hunt." He highlighted Carter Page's claims of false testimony by Comey and Brennan, urging the committee to investigate alleged collusion between Clinton associates and Obama officials. The article frames Griffin's actions as morally wrong and Trump's criticism as justified, while casting Democrats' actions as politically motivated. END OF SUMMARY.
