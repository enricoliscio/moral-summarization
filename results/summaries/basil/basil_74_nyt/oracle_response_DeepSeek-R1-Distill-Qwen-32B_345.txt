Okay, so the user has provided a news article about Trump's recent Twitter outbursts, specifically targeting Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. They want a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. The user has already listed the morally charged words from the article, so I need to make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Trump is upset with Kathy Griffin for a video where she's holding a prop of his severed head. This caused a lot of backlash, leading her to apologize and CNN firing her. The First Lady also criticized her, questioning her sanity. Griffin apologized, saying she crossed the line and it was wrong. Then, Trump also criticized Democrats for trying to squelch testimony related to the Russian investigation, calling it a witch hunt. Carter Page, a former Trump advisor, wants to testify to clear his name and address false testimony by Comey and Brennan.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the morally framed words: disturbing, wrong, crossed, squelch, witch hunt, excoriated, testify, clear, testimony, providing, proceed, investigate, collusion.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's Twitter blasts, targeting Griffin and Democrats. Highlight the video as disturbing and wrong. Mention her crossing the line and apologizing. Then, note Trump's criticism of Democrats trying to squelch testimony, calling it a witch hunt. Include Carter Page wanting to clear his name and investigate collusion.

I should ensure the summary flows well, using the moral terms appropriately without making it too choppy. Also, keep it concise to stay within the word limit. Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all key points and the moral framing words.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump has lashed out on Twitter, criticizing Democrats and comedian Kathy Griffin. Griffin sparked controversy with a video showing her holding a prop of Trump’s severed and bloodied head, which many found disturbing and wrong. Griffin apologized, admitting she crossed the line and the image was too far, acknowledging it offended people and was not funny. CNN fired her from its New Year’s Eve show, and the First Lady Melania Trump questioned her sanity. Trump also criticized Democrats for allegedly trying to squelch testimony in the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a witch hunt. He accused Democrats of excoriating Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, while blocking his testimony to clear his name. Page wants to address false testimony by James Comey and John Brennan, urging the committee to investigate collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. Trump and his supporters view these actions as an attempt to provide accurate information and proceed with a fair investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
