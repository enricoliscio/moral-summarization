SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to condemn a tasteless video by Kathy Griffin, in which she held what looked like his severed head. The video sparked outrage across the political spectrum, leading to Griffin's apology and her dismissal from CNN's New Year's Eve show. The first lady, Melania Trump, also questioned Griffin's sanity, highlighting the disturbing nature of the image. Griffin's apology acknowledged that she had crossed a line and recognized the offense caused by her actions. Separately, Trump criticized Democrats for attempting to suppress testimony related to the Russia investigation, characterizing it as a "witch hunt." Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor, was reportedly blocked from testifying by Democrats, despite his desire to clear his name and expose alleged false testimony by James Comey and John Brennan. Page also urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
