SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to lash out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats. Griffin had posed for a video holding a mock severed head of Trump, sparking widespread outrage and an apology from her. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also condemned the photo, questioning Griffin's sanity. CNN fired Griffin from their New Year's Eve program as a result. Trump also targeted Democrats in Congress, accusing them of trying to suppress testimony from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian election meddling. Trump called it a "witch hunt" and claimed Page's testimony would clear his name and expose false testimony from former FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan.

END OF SUMMARY.
