SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to lash out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats. Griffin had posted a video showing her holding a fake, bloodied head of Trump, sparking widespread outrage and an apology from her. Trump and the First Lady, Melania Trump, condemned the photo, with Melania questioning Griffin's sanity. CNN subsequently fired Griffin from their New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to suppress testimony from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump claimed it was a "witch hunt" against him and that Page's testimony would clear his name by showing "false or misleading testimony" by James Comey and John Brennan. Page had written to the House Intelligence Committee expressing his desire to address the "false or misleading testimony" and urging an investigation into collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.

END OF SUMMARY.
