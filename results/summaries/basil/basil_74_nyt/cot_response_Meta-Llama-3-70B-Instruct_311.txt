SUMMARY:
President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a television comedian, for posing with a severed and bloodied head resembling his, calling it a "disturbing" and "wrong" photo opportunity. Griffin apologized, saying she "crossed the line" and "went too far," and begged for forgiveness. Melania Trump also condemned the photo, questioning Griffin's sanity. CNN fired Griffin from their New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony involving the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" and claiming they don't want to hear from Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign adviser. Page wrote to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate "false or misleading testimony" and "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
