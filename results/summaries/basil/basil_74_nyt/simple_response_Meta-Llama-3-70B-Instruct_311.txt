SUMMARY:

President Trump lashed out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats on Twitter, criticizing Griffin for a disturbing video showing her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump's. Griffin apologized, acknowledging she crossed a line and made a mistake. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also condemned the video, questioning Griffin's sanity. CNN fired Griffin from their New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to suppress testimony in the Russian election meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. He cited a letter from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, who wants to testify and clear his name.

The moral framing of this article emphasizes the disturbing nature of Griffin's video and the importance of respecting human dignity. It also highlights the importance of fairness and transparency in political investigations, with Trump and Page accusing Democrats of trying to suppress the truth. Overall, the article presents a critical view of Griffin's actions and a skeptical view of Democratic motives in the Russian investigation.
