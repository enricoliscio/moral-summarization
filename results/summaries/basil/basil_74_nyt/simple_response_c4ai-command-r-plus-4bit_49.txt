SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to condemn a tasteless video by Kathy Griffin in which she brandishes a fake, bloodied head resembling that of the president. The video sparked outrage across the political spectrum, leading to a rare moment of bipartisan unity in its condemnation. The first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's sanity and the mental health of anyone who would create such a disturbing image. Griffin eventually apologized, but the damage was done, as she was fired from her role at CNN's New Year's Eve program. 

In other news, Trump also took aim at Democrats in Congress, accusing them of attempting to silence Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, from testifying in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Page himself has expressed a desire to clear his name and expose what he believes to be false testimony by James Comey and John Brennan. 

END OF SUMMARY.
