Trump also accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony in the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, wrote to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate the growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. The moral tone of the article emphasizes the importance of respecting boundaries, telling the truth, and seeking accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
