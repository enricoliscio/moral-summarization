SUMMARY:

President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a TV comedian, and Democrats on Twitter, sparking a storm of protests from people across the political spectrum. Griffin had posed for a video holding a severed and bloodied head of Trump, which was widely deemed "disturbing" and "wrong". She later apologized, saying she had "crossed the line" and went "too far". The first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's sanity, calling the photo opportunity "simply wrong" and wondering about her mental health.

Trump also accused Democrats of trying to "squelch" testimony involving the Russian election meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. He claimed they didn't want to hear from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, who wanted to "clear his name" and provide "accurate information". Page urged the committee to "investigate" evidence of "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
