SUMMARY:
President Trump castigated Kathy Griffin for posing in a video with what appeared to be the severed and bloodied head of the president. The video sparked outrage across the political spectrum, leading Griffin to issue apologies and CNN to fire her from their New Year's Eve program. In the midst of this controversy, Trump also lashed out at Democrats, accusing them of trying to squelch testimony in the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. He labeled it a "witch hunt," claiming that Democrats were trying to hide "false or misleading" testimony. Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, was set to testify but was reportedly blocked by Democrats. Page wanted to clear his name and expose what he believed to be growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates and former Obama administration officials. The First Lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's sanity, calling the photo "disturbing" and "wrong," especially considering the atrocious acts happening in the world. Griffin begged for forgiveness, admitting she went too far. END OF SUMMARY.
