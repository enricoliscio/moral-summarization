SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to condemn Kathy Griffin, a television comedian, for a disturbing video in which she held what appeared to be his severed, bloodied head. The video sparked widespread outrage, leading Griffin to apologize and CNN to dismiss her from their New Year's Eve program. Melania Trump questioned Griffin's sanity, calling the photo "wrong" and "disturbing." In a separate tweet, Trump accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony related to the Russia investigation, calling it a "witch hunt." Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, was referenced in a "Fox and Friends" segment as being blocked by Democrats from testifying. Trump agreed, saying Page wanted to clear his name by exposing "false or misleading testimony." Page also urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. Griffin's actions crossed the line, and her apology and removal from the CNN program were appropriate consequences. Meanwhile, Trump's accusation of a "witch hunt" seems to be an attempt to distract from the serious investigation into potential collusion with Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
