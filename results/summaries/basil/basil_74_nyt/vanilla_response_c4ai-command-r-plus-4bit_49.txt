SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to criticize comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats in Congress. Griffin faced backlash for a video showing her holding what appeared to be the severed, bloodied head of Trump, leading to her firing from CNN's New Year's Eve program. Melania Trump questioned Griffin's sanity and called the photo disturbing. Griffin apologized, acknowledging that she crossed the line. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to squelch Carter Page's testimony in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, calling it a "witch hunt." Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, claimed that there was collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Comey, Brennan, and other Obama administration officials. Democrats reportedly no longer want Page to testify, which Trump sees as an attempt to suppress evidence. 

END OF SUMMARY.
