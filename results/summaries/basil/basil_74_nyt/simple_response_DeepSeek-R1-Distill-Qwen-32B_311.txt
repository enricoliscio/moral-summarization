Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Trump's recent Twitter activity. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

So, Trump is back from an overseas trip and has been active on Twitter again. He's attacking Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. The main points are: Griffin's video with a fake severed head of Trump, the public reaction, her apology, CNN firing her, Melania Trump's comment on her sanity, and Trump's criticism of Democrats over the Russia investigation.

I should make sure the summary includes all these elements. Also, the moral framing is important. The article shows Trump as upset over the offensive image and criticizing Democrats for what he sees as a witch hunt. Melania's comment adds a personal touch, questioning Griffin's mental health. Griffin's apology is sincere but doesn't mention Trump directly. The Democrats are accused of trying to stop testimony, which Trump sees as part of the investigation against him.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's return from the trip and his Twitter activity. Then, detail Griffin's incident, her apology, and the fallout. Next, touch on the Democrats and the Russia investigation part. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the disturbance caused by the image and Trump's witch hunt accusation.

Let me structure it: Trump returns from trip, starts tweeting again. Assails Griffin for the video, which caused a stir. Griffin apologizes, CNN fires her. Melania comments on her sanity. Trump also criticizes Democrats for trying to block testimony in the Russia probe, calling it a witch hunt. Page's letter about false testimony by Comey and Brennan. 

I should make sure each point is clear but brief. Avoid getting too deep into each part; just the essentials. Also, maintain the moral perspective: the video was offensive, Trump's reaction is strong, Democrats are accused of obstruction. 

I think that's a solid outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all necessary points with the moral framing intact.
