SUMMARY:

President Trump has lashed out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats on Twitter, criticizing Griffin for a video that showed her holding a fake severed head of Trump. Griffin apologized for the video, saying she "went too far" and "was wrong." CNN has fired Griffin from its New Year's Eve program as a result. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also condemned the video, questioning Griffin's sanity. Trump also attacked Democrats, accusing them of trying to suppress testimony from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump called it a "witch hunt" against him. Page has written to the House Intelligence Committee, asking to testify and clear his name, and accusing former Obama administration officials of colluding with the Clinton campaign.
