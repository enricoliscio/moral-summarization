Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump lashing out at Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral aspects involved.

First, Trump is criticizing Kathy Griffin for a video where she's holding a fake severed head that looks like his. The article mentions that this caused a lot of backlash, leading Griffin to apologize and CNN firing her. The first lady Melania Trump also commented, questioning Griffin's sanity and calling the photo disturbing. That's a strong moral statement, implying that Griffin's actions were not just wrong but mentally unstable.

Then, Trump also attacks Democrats for trying to prevent testimony in the Russian meddling investigation. He accuses them of a witch hunt, which is a moral accusation against their intentions. The article also mentions Carter Page's letter, where he claims there's collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama officials, which is another layer of moral framing about betrayal and corruption.

I need to make sure the summary captures these moral elements: the outrage over the photo, the questioning of Griffin's mental state, Trump's witch hunt accusation, and the implication of Democratic collusion. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's criticism of Griffin, her apology, CNN's decision, Melania's comment. Then move to Trump's attack on Democrats, the witch hunt claim, and Carter Page's allegations. Make sure each part is brief but covers the moral aspects.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, since the user provided an example response, I can use that as a reference to ensure I'm on the right track. The example includes all these elements, so I can follow a similar structure but make sure it's my own wording and captures the moral framing accurately.

Alright, I think I have a good plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure each sentence conveys the moral stance without being too wordy. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words.
