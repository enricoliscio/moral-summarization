Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Trump lashing out on Twitter after a hiatus. He's upset with Kathy Griffin for a video where she holds a fake severed head of him. The video caused a lot of backlash, leading Griffin to apologize and CNN firing her. Melania Trump called the photo disturbing and questioned Griffin's mental health. Griffin apologized, saying she crossed the line and the image was wrong.

Additionally, Trump criticized Democrats for trying to stop testimony related to the Russian investigation. He accused them of a witch hunt, mentioning Carter Page and others. Page wants to clear his name by testifying against Comey and Brennan, suggesting collusion between Clinton associates and Obama officials.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the morally charged words like disturbing, wrong, crossed, witch hunt, etc. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include those terms.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's tweets upon returning from his trip, the Griffin incident, her apology, and the fallout. Then, I'll move to his criticism of Democrats, using terms like witch hunt and squelch. I'll make sure to include the key moral words without making it too lengthy.

Let me structure it: Trump tweets about Griffin, her apology, CNN's decision, Melania's statement. Then, Trump accuses Democrats of squelching testimony, witch hunt, and Carter Page's desire to clear his name. I'll ensure each part is brief but covers the essential moral points.

I should also check that I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the facts with the moral framing intact. Okay, I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump criticized Kathy Griffin and Democrats on Twitter after returning from an overseas trip. Griffin apologized for a video showing her holding a fake, bloodied Trump head, which she called "disturbing" and admitted crossed the line. CNN fired her from its New Year’s Eve show. First Lady Melania Trump condemned the image, questioning Griffin’s sanity. Griffin expressed regret, stating the image was "too disturbing" and "not funny." Trump also accused Democrats of trying to "squelch" testimony in the Russian election meddling investigation. He called it a "witch hunt," referencing Carter Page, a former Trump adviser, who wants to testify to "clear" his name and address "false or misleading testimony" by James Comey and John Brennan. Page urged the House Intelligence Committee to "investigate" alleged "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.  
END OF SUMMARY.
