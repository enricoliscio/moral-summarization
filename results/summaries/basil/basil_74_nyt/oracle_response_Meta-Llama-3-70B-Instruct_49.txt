SUMMARY:

President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a television comedian, and Democrats on Twitter, sparking a wave of protests and outrage. Griffin had posed for a video holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump, which was widely deemed "disturbing" and "wrong". The comedian apologized, saying she had "crossed the line" and went "too far", and begged for forgiveness. CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve program. Melania Trump questioned Griffin's sanity, saying the photo opportunity was "simply wrong" and made her wonder about Griffin's "mental health". Trump also accused Democrats of trying to "squelch" testimony involving the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. He claimed Democrats didn't want to hear from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, who wanted to "clear his name" and provide "accurate information". Trump urged the House Intelligence Committee to "investigate" evidence of "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
