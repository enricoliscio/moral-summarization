Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump reacting to Kathy Griffin's controversial video where she's holding a fake severed head resembling Trump. He criticizes her on Twitter, and the first lady Melania Trump also condemns the act, questioning her sanity. Griffin apologizes, saying she crossed the line and the image was too disturbing. CNN fires her from their New Year's Eve show. Trump also attacks Democrats, accusing them of trying to block testimony in the Russian meddling investigation. He calls it a witch hunt and mentions Carter Page's claims about false testimony from Comey and Brennan.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. I need to make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like Trump's criticism of Griffin's action as wrong, Melania's concern about her mental health, Griffin's apology, and the broader implications of the political conflict.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's Twitter attacks, the reaction from Melania, Griffin's apology, the consequences for her career, and Trump's accusations against Democrats. I also need to mention the witch hunt narrative and Carter Page's claims.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Trump's actions, then move to Griffin's video and the reactions, followed by the political conflict with Democrats. I'll make sure to include the moral elements like the appropriateness of the joke, the impact on public perception, and the accusations of a witch hunt.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
