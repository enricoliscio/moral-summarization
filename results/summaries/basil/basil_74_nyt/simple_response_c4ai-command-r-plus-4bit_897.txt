SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to condemn Democrats and comedian Kathy Griffin for their recent actions. Griffin posted a disturbing video of herself holding what appeared to be the severed, bloodied head of the president, sparking outrage across the political spectrum. The Trumps received support from many, including the daughter of Trump's 2016 election opponent. Griffin has since apologized and been fired from her role at CNN. Melania Trump questioned Griffin's sanity and the mental health of someone who would do such a thing. In other news, Trump also criticized Democrats in Congress for their handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the election, accusing them of trying to squelch testimony from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. Page has urged the committee to investigate evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. 

END OF SUMMARY.
