SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to condemn a tasteless video by Kathy Griffin, in which she held what looked like his severed, bloodied head. The video sparked outrage across the political spectrum, leading to Ms. Griffin's apology and her firing from CNN's New Year's Eve program. The First Lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffin's sanity, calling the video disturbing and insensitive given global atrocities. Ms. Griffin issued a remorseful apology, acknowledging her mistake. The incident reflects a concerning trend of disrespect and insensitivity in political discourse. 

Separately, Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for their handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. He accused them of suppressing testimony from Carter Page, calling it a "witch hunt." Mr. Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, alleged false testimony by James Comey and John Brennan but did not provide specifics. The incident adds to the ongoing political drama surrounding the Russia investigation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
