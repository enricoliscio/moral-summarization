Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about President Trump reacting to Kathy Griffin's controversial video and his criticism of Democrats. 

First, I should identify the key points. Trump is upset about the video where Griffin holds a fake severed head of him. This caused a lot of backlash, leading her to apologize and lose her job at CNN. The First Lady also commented on Griffin's sanity. Then, Trump also criticized Democrats for trying to block testimony in the Russia investigation, calling it a witch hunt.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements. I should mention Trump's tweets, Griffin's apology, the fallout from the video, Melania's statement, and Trump's criticism of Democrats. I also need to note the context, like the overseas trip where he wasn't active on social media before.

I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective, highlighting how Trump and others reacted to the video and the political implications. I'll structure it by first talking about Griffin's incident, then the political criticism. Make sure to include that Griffin apologized and CNN fired her, and that Trump accused Democrats of a witch hunt regarding the Russia probe.

I need to be concise but cover all main points without going into too much detail. Also, ensure the moral framing is preserved, like the criticism of Griffin's sanity and the political witch hunt accusation.
