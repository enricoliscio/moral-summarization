SUMMARY:
President Trump blasted Kathy Griffin and Democrats in a series of tweets on Wednesday, continuing his combative social media presence. He assailed Griffin for posing with what looked like his severed, bloodied head, an image that touched off a storm of protests. The president's wife, Melania Trump, joined in castigating Griffin, questioning her sanity and calling the image disturbing. Griffin apologized, admitting she crossed the line and went too far. She begged for forgiveness. Trump also lashed out at Democrats, accusing them of trying to squelch testimony in the Russia investigation. He claimed it was part of a witch hunt against him and that Democrats were excoriating Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, without cause. Page himself stated that there is growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Comey and other Obama administration officials.
