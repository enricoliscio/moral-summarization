SUMMARY:
President Trump castigated Kathy Griffin, a television comedian, for posing with what looked like his severed and bloodied head. The video touched off a storm of protests and forced Ms. Griffin to apologize. The first lady, Melania Trump, called the image disturbing and questioned Ms. Griffin’s sanity. Ms. Griffin admitted she crossed the line and begged for forgiveness. Mr. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony involving the investigation into Russian meddling in the election, calling it a “witch hunt.” He claimed that Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, wanted to clear his name by exposing false or misleading testimony given by James Comey and John Brennan. Mr. Page urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. END OF SUMMARY.
