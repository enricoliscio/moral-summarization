SUMMARY:

President Trump lashed out on Twitter, criticizing comedian Kathy Griffin for a disturbing video depicting her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump's. The video sparked widespread outrage, prompting Griffin to apologize and CNN to fire her from their New Year's Eve program. Melania Trump also condemned the photo, questioning Griffin's sanity. Griffin acknowledged crossing a line and begged for forgiveness. Trump also attacked Democrats, accusing them of trying to suppress testimony in the Russian election meddling investigation. He claimed it was a "witch hunt" against him, citing Carter Page's desire to clear his name by exposing allegedly false testimony by James Comey and John Brennan.

The moral framing of this article highlights the disturbing and offensive nature of Griffin's video, as well as the Trumps' outrage and condemnation of it. It also emphasizes the importance of respecting the dignity of individuals, even in the context of political satire. Additionally, the article implies that Trump's attacks on Democrats and the investigation into Russian meddling are unfounded and motivated by self-interest.
