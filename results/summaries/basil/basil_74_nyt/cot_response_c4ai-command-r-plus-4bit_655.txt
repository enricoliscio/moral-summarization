SUMMARY: 
President Trump assailed Democrats and comedian Kathy Griffin on Twitter, criticizing Griffin for posing with what looked like the President's severed head. The image touched off a storm of protests, forcing Griffin to apologize and CNN to fire her from their New Year's Eve program. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also weighed in, questioning Griffin's sanity and calling the image disturbing. Griffin begged for forgiveness, admitting she had made a mistake and crossed a line. Mr. Trump also lashed out at Democrats, accusing them of trying to squelch testimony in the Russia investigation and calling it a "witch hunt." Trump cited Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, who claimed he had evidence of false testimony and collusion with Clinton campaign associates. Page's request to testify was reportedly blocked by Democrats, who Trump accused of trying to silence him. 
END OF SUMMARY.
