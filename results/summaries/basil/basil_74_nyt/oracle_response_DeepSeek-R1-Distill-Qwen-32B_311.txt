Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral terms involved.

The article talks about President Trump lashing out at Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. He criticized her for a video where she held a prop that looked like his severed head, which he found disturbing and wrong. The First Lady also commented, questioning her sanity. Griffin apologized, admitting she crossed the line and went too far. CNN fired her as a result.

Additionally, Trump criticized Democrats for trying to squelch testimony related to the Russian meddling investigation. He accused them of a witch hunt, specifically mentioning Carter Page, who wanted to clear his name by testifying against Comey and Brennan. Page urged the committee to investigate collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama officials.

The moral words to include are: disturbing, wrong, crossed, cross, far, offends, squelch, hunt, excoriated, testify, clear, testimony, providing, proceed, investigate, collusion.

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. Let me structure the summary to cover both Griffin and the Democrats, using those terms appropriately. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while retaining the moral framing.
