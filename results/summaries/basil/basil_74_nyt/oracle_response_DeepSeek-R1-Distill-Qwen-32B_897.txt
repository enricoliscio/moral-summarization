Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Trump lashing out at Kathy Griffin and Democrats. The author used specific morally charged words, so I should make sure to include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump criticized Kathy Griffin for a video where she held a fake severed head of him. This caused a lot of backlash, leading her to apologize and CNN to fire her. The First Lady also criticized her, questioning her mental health. Griffin apologized, saying she crossed the line and the image was too disturbing. She asked for forgiveness.

Then, Trump also criticized Democrats for trying to stop testimony in the Russia investigation. He accused them of a witch hunt. Carter Page, a former Trump adviser, wanted to testify but was reportedly blocked. Page accused Comey and Brennan of false testimony, suggesting collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama officials.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words like disturbing, wrong, crossed, etc. I should structure the summary to include Trump's actions, Griffin's response, the fallout, and the political accusations.

I'll start by stating Trump's criticism of Griffin and the Democrats. Mention the video and the reaction. Include the First Lady's comments. Then, Griffin's apology, emphasizing she crossed the line and the image was disturbing. Then, move to the political part: Trump accuses Democrats of squelching testimony, witch hunt, and Carter Page's claims about false testimony and collusion.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral words as possible. I'll avoid adding my own interpretations and stick to the facts presented, maintaining the moral framing from the original text.
