Okay, I need to summarize this article about Trump lashing out at Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article starts by saying Trump criticized Democrats and Kathy Griffin on Twitter after returning from an overseas trip. He had been less active on social media during that trip. The main issue was a video where Griffin held a prop that looked like Trump's severed head. This caused a lot of backlash, leading her to apologize and CNN firing her from their New Year's Eve show.

Melania Trump also commented, questioning Griffin's sanity. Griffin apologized, saying she crossed the line and the image was too disturbing. She didn't mention Trump specifically. CNN dropped her, and Anderson Cooper distanced himself too.

Additionally, Trump criticized Democrats for trying to block testimony in the Russia investigation. He accused them of a witch hunt, specifically mentioning Carter Page, a former Trump adviser. Page wanted to testify about false statements by Comey and Brennan, but the Democrats didn't want him to. Trump supports this, claiming it's a witch hunt.

So, the key points are:
1. Trump criticizes Griffin for the video and Democrats for blocking testimony.
2. Griffin's video caused her to apologize and lose her job at CNN.
3. Melania Trump also criticized Griffin.
4. Trump accused Democrats of a witch hunt regarding the Russia investigation and Carter Page's testimony.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements clearly. I should structure it to first mention Trump's Twitter attacks, then Griffin's incident, her apology, and the consequences. Then, move on to the political aspect with Democrats and the Russia investigation, including Page's testimony.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Also, keep it concise and within the word limit.
