SUMMARY: President Trump blasted Kathy Griffin and Democrats in a series of tweets, marking a return to his combative social media style. Griffin faced backlash for a video showing her with a fake, bloodied head of Trump, leading to her firing from CNN's New Year's Eve program. The incident was condemned by Melania Trump, who questioned Griffin's sanity. Griffin apologized, acknowledging that she "crossed the line." Meanwhile, Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a "witch hunt" against him regarding the Russia investigation. He claimed that Democrats were trying to squelch testimony from Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, who wanted to clear his name by exposing false statements. Page urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
END OF SUMMARY.
