SUMMARY:
President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a television comedian, for posing with a severed and bloodied head resembling his, calling it a "disturbing" and "wrong" photo opportunity. The first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's "sanity" and said the image was "very disturbing" considering the "atrocities" happening in the world today. Griffin apologized, expressing "regret" and asking for "forgiveness" for crossing the line. CNN fired her from their annual New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony involving the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. Trump's campaign adviser, Carter Page, wrote to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate the "false or misleading testimony" by former officials. END OF SUMMARY.
