Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed response, but I should think through how to approach this task.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. These are words that carry a moral judgment or implication. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "lash out," "assailed," "combative," "castigated," "protests," "apologize," "disturbing," "wrong," "mental health," "crossed the line," "offends," "begged," "witch hunt," "squelch," "meddling," "excused," "false," "misleading," "collusion," "excoriated," "falsehoods," and "clear."

Next, I need to write a summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and capture the main points of the article while maintaining the moral tone.

So, the main points are:
- Trump criticized Democrats and Kathy Griffin on Twitter.
- Griffin's video with a fake Trump head caused a backlash, leading her to apologize.
- The Trumps questioned her sanity.
- CNN fired her.
- Trump also accused Democrats of a witch hunt regarding the Russia investigation.
- Carter Page wants to testify about false testimony by Comey and Brennan.

I need to weave these points together using the identified morally charged words. I'll start with Trump's actions, then Griffin's situation, and end with the political accusations. I'll make sure to include words like "lash out," "castigated," "disturbing," "wrong," "witch hunt," etc.

I should check that the summary flows well and doesn't exceed the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral framing words.
