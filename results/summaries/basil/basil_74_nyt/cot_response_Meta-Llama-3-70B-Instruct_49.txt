SUMMARY:
President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a comedian, for a "disturbing" video showing her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump's. Griffin apologized, saying she "crossed the line" and "went too far" with the "offending" image. Melania Trump questioned Griffin's "sanity" and CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to "squelch" testimony involving the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, wrote to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. Trump's tweets sparked a heated debate, with many calling out Griffin's "wrong" actions and others defending her right to free speech. END OF SUMMARY.
