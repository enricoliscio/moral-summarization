SUMMARY:

President Trump has taken to Twitter to lash out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats. Griffin had posted a video showing her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump, sparking widespread outrage and an apology from her. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also criticized Griffin, questioning her sanity. CNN has fired Griffin from its annual New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats in Congress of trying to suppress testimony from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump called it a "witch hunt" against him. Page had written to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates, Comey, and other former Obama administration officials.

END OF SUMMARY.
