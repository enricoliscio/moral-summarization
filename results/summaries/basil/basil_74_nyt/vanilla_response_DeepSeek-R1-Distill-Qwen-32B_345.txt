Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump lashing out at Kathy Griffin and the Democrats. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Trump criticized Democrats and Kathy Griffin on Twitter after returning from an overseas trip where he didn't post much. He's upset because Kathy Griffin made a video where she's holding what looks like a severed head of him, which caused a lot of backlash. She had to apologize, and CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve show. Melania Trump also commented, saying the photo was disturbing and questioned Griffin's mental health. Griffin herself apologized, saying she crossed the line and it wasn't funny. She asked for forgiveness but didn't mention Trump directly.

Then, Trump also criticized Democrats for not wanting Carter Page to testify in the Russia investigation. He called it a witch hunt. Page wanted to clear his name by saying Comey and Brennan gave false testimony. But the Democrats don't want him to testify anymore.

So, the main points are:
1. Trump criticizes Griffin for the disturbing video, leading to her apologizing and losing her job at CNN.
2. Melania Trump also condemns the video.
3. Trump attacks Democrats for blocking Carter Page's testimony, accusing them of a witch hunt.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Maybe start with Trump's criticism, then mention Griffin's apology and CNN's decision, then Melania's comment. Then switch to the Democrats and Carter Page's situation, explaining Trump's accusations.

I should also keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all important aspects are covered without exceeding the word limit.
