SUMMARY: President Trump assailed Kathy Griffin, a television comedian, for posing with what looked like his severed, bloodied head. The image was disturbing and offended people across the political spectrum, leading Ms. Griffin to apologize and CNN to fire her. The first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffin's sanity, stating that the photo was wrong and raised concerns about her mental health. Ms. Griffin also begged for forgiveness, admitting she crossed the line and went too far. In other news, Mr. Trump lashed out at Democrats, accusing them of trying to squelch testimony in the Russia investigation. He claimed it was a witch hunt, and that Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, wanted to clear his name by exposing false testimony. Mr. Page urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
