SUMMARY:
President Trump took to Twitter to blast Kathy Griffin for a video in which she held what looked like his severed and bloodied head. The video outraged people across the political spectrum, leading Griffin to apologize and CNN to fire her from their New Year's Eve program. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also questioned Griffin's sanity, calling the photo "disturbing" and questioning her mental health. In other tweets, Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a "witch hunt" against him and trying to squelch testimony related to the Russia investigation. Trump claimed that Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, wanted to clear his name by exposing "false and misleading" testimony by James Comey and John Brennan. Page also urged the investigation of alleged collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. The President's tweets come after a period of abstinence from his typically combative social media postings during his overseas trip.
