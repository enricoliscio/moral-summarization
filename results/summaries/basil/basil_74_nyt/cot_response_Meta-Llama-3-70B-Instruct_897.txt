SUMMARY:
President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a TV comedian, for a "disturbing" video showing her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling him. Griffin apologized "sincerely" for crossing the line, saying she made a "mistake" and was "wrong". First Lady Melania Trump questioned Griffin's "sanity" and condemned the photo opportunity as "wrong" amidst global "atrocities". CNN fired Griffin from their New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to "squelch" testimony in the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt". Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser, wrote to the House Intelligence Committee to clear his name from "false or misleading testimony" by James Comey and John Brennan. END OF SUMMARY.
