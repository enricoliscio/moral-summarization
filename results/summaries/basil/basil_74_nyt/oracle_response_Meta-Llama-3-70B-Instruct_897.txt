SUMMARY: President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin, a comedian, and Democrats on Twitter, sparking a wave of outrage and moral condemnation. Griffin's disturbing video, which showed her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump, was widely criticized as wrong and offensive. The first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's sanity, saying the photo opportunity was "simply wrong" and made her wonder about Griffin's mental health. Griffin apologized, saying she crossed the line and went too far, and CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony involving the Russian meddling investigation, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, wrote to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate the growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials. END OF SUMMARY.
