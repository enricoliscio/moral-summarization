SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to lash out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats. Griffin had posted a video showing her holding a severed and bloodied head resembling Trump, sparking widespread outrage. Trump criticized Griffin, and First Lady Melania Trump questioned Griffin's sanity. Griffin later apologized, saying she had crossed a line and went too far. CNN announced it would fire Griffin from its New Year's Eve program. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to suppress testimony from Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump called it a "witch hunt" and claimed Page's testimony would clear his name and show false testimony from James Comey and John Brennan. Page had written to the House Intelligence Committee, urging them to investigate collusion between Clinton campaign associates and Obama administration officials.
