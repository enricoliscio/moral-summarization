Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about President Trump reacting on Twitter after a trip where he didn't post much. He's criticizing Democrats and Kathy Griffin. 

First, I should identify the key events. Kathy Griffin made a controversial video with a prop of Trump's head, which caused a lot of backlash. She apologized, and CNN fired her. The First Lady also commented on her sanity. That's an important point to include.

Next, Trump also criticized Democrats for not wanting Carter Page to testify. Page was involved in the Russia investigation, and Trump called it a witch hunt. I should mention that Democrats are accused of trying to suppress testimony, which ties into the Russia collusion angle.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main actions and reactions. I'll structure it by first mentioning Trump's return from his trip and his renewed Twitter activity. Then, I'll cover the Griffin incident and her apology, followed by CNN's decision. After that, I'll touch on Trump's criticism of Democrats regarding the testimony and the witch hunt accusation.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, capturing all the essential elements without going into too much detail. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the user's instructions. Let me put it all together in a coherent way.
