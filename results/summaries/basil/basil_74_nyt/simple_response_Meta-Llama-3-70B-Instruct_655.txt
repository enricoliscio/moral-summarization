SUMMARY:

President Trump lashed out at comedian Kathy Griffin and Democrats on Twitter, sparking controversy and outrage. Griffin had posted a video showing her holding a mock severed and bloodied head of Trump, which was widely condemned across the political spectrum. Trump and the First Lady Melania Trump criticized Griffin, with Melania questioning her sanity and calling the photo opportunity "wrong" and "disturbing". Griffin apologized, saying she had crossed a line and made a mistake. CNN fired her from their New Year's Eve program as a result. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to suppress testimony in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, calling it a "witch hunt" against him. The moral of the story is that actions have consequences, and Griffin's attempt at humor was misguided and harmful. Furthermore, the president's accusations against Democrats only serve to further divide and distract from the real issues at hand.

END OF SUMMARY.
