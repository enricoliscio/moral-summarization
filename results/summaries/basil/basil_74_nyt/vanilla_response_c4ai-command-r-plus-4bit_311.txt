SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to criticize Democrats and comedian Kathy Griffin. Griffin posted a video holding what looked like the severed, bloodied head of Trump, sparking outrage across the political spectrum. She later apologized for the video and was fired from her role at CNN. Melania Trump also condemned Griffin's actions, questioning her mental health. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to silence Carter Page, a former campaign adviser, in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Page has requested to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, but Democrats are reportedly reluctant to hear his testimony. Trump called the investigation a "witch hunt." 

END OF SUMMARY.
