SUMMARY: President Trump has lashed out at Kathy Griffin and Democrats in a series of combative Twitter posts. Griffin, a celebrity comic, posted a disturbing video of herself holding what looked like the severed and bloodied head of Trump, sparking outrage across the political spectrum. The first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Griffin's sanity, calling the photo "wrong" and "disturbing." Griffin has since apologized, but the Trumps are not the only ones who were offended. CNN, which had enlisted Griffin for its New Year's Eve programming, has fired her, and Anderson Cooper has distanced himself. In other tweets, Trump accused Democrats of trying to squelch testimony related to the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He claimed it was part of a "witch hunt" against him and called for an investigation into "collusion" between Clinton campaign associates and former Obama administration officials. Trump's tweets come after a period of relative abstinence from social media during his overseas trip. 
END OF SUMMARY.
