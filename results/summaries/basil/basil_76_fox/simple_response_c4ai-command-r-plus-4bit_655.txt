SUMMARY: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that President Trump believes that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Moore has been accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and several other women have come forward with similar allegations. Moore has denied the allegations and has refused to drop out of the race, calling the accusations "fake news" and a "last ditch Hail Mary" by his political opponents. The White House and several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, with at least one senator saying he should drop out regardless. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact by an adult with a minor between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse. The statute of limitations has passed, but the moral implications of Moore's actions, if true, are significant.

END OF SUMMARY.
