SUMMARY:

President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. The White House cautioned against a rush to judgment, stating that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. However, if the allegations are true, Moore should drop out of the race. Moore denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" by the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." He claimed that "the forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives." Several GOP senators called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, with some demanding he drop out regardless. The allegations include claims of sexual abuse by Moore when the women were teenagers, with one woman saying she wanted to "sit back and let this continue, let him continue without the mask being removed." Alabama's Republican governor said the allegations are "deeply disturbing" and will hold judgment until the facts are known.
