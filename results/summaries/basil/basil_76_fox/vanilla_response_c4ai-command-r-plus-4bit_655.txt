SUMMARY: The White House stated that President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against rushing to judgment, stating that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, lashing out at the "liberal media" and vowing to never give up the fight. The Washington Post reported on allegations made by Leigh Corfman, who claimed Moore, then 32, initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others have said he should drop out regardless. Moore's campaign has called the report "baseless" and false, claiming it is a political smear campaign. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also called for an investigation and stated that the people of Alabama deserve to know the truth.
END OF SUMMARY.
