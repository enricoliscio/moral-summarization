SUMMARY:

President Trump's White House has stated that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when Moore was 32. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news." However, several GOP senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. Moore's campaign has claimed that the report is "baseless" and an attempt to discredit him. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and the statute of limitations has passed. Despite the controversy, Moore has vowed to continue his campaign, saying "I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!"
