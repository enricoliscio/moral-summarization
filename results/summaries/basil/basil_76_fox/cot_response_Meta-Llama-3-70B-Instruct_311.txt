SUMMARY:
President Trump believes that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Moore is accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and three other women have come forward with similar allegations. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "baseless" and "fake news," and claiming that they are a "fabrication" by the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, citing the "deeply troubling" and "disturbing" nature of the claims. END OF SUMMARY.
