SUMMARY:

President Trump's White House has stated that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also cautioned against a rush to judgment, emphasizing that mere allegations should not destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" orchestrated by the Democratic Party and liberal media. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl and pursuing other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others have said he should drop out of the race regardless. The moral framing of this issue is clear: it is unacceptable for a person in a position of power to engage in sexual misconduct, especially with minors. The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and make their own decisions.
