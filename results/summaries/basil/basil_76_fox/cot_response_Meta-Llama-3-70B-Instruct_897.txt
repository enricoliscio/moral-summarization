SUMMARY:
President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, the White House also cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" orchestrated by the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." The allegations, which include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl, have sparked outrage, with many calling for Moore to drop out of the race. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if the allegations are true, Moore "must step aside." Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, called the allegations "deeply disturbing" and said she will hold judgment until the facts are known. END OF SUMMARY.
