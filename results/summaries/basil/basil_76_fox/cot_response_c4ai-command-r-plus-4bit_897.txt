SUMMARY: 
The White House stated that President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the *right* thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are *true*. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against a *rush to judgment*, stating that "the president believes we cannot allow a *mere allegation*, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person's life." Moore has denied the allegations, lashing out at what he called "the Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media *lapdogs*." He claimed that the "forces of evil" will stop at nothing to silence and shut up *Christian conservatives*. Moore has refused to drop out of the race, stating that "our nation is at a *crossroads* right now â€” spiritually and politically." The allegations against Moore were made by Leigh Corfman, who claimed that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "*garbage*" and "*fake news*." He and his campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, have also called the allegations "intentional *defamation*." Several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are *true*, while others have said he should drop out regardless. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has said she will "hold *judgment*" until the facts are known and that the people of Alabama deserve the *truth*.
