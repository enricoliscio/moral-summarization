SUMMARY: President Trump joins Republican calls for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. The allegations, made by a woman now 53, claim Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was just 14 years old. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and a "last ditch Hail Mary" by his political opponents. The White House has cautioned against a rush to judgment, but asserted that if the allegations are true, Moore should do the right thing and withdraw from the race. Several GOP senators have echoed this sentiment, with some even calling for Moore to drop out regardless of the allegations' veracity. The allegations have caused a rift in the Republican Party and have thrown Moore's campaign into turmoil. The people of Alabama are now faced with a difficult decision as they weigh the moral implications of these allegations against the political implications of the upcoming election. END OF SUMMARY.
