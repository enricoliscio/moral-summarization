Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand the requirements.

The user provided a news article about Roy Moore's sexual misconduct allegations and wants a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll go through the article to identify the key points. The main elements are Trump's statement about Moore stepping aside if the allegations are true, the White House's caution against rushing to judgment, Moore's accusations against the media and Democrats, the specific allegations from Leigh Corfman, the reactions from other Republicans, and the legal context about the statute of limitations.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like "step," "destroy," "lie," "cheat," "steal," "inflict," "silence," "drop," "answer," "fabrication," "news," "defamation," "abuse," "sit," and "removed." 

I should structure the summary to cover Trump's stance, Moore's response, the allegations, reactions from both parties, and the legal aspects. I'll need to weave in those moral words naturally without making the summary feel forced.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's expectation for Moore to step aside. Then, mention the White House's caution against destroying a person's life. Next, describe Moore's accusations about the media lying and stealing. Then, outline the allegations from Corfman, emphasizing the abuse and the legal age. Include the statute of limitations. Then, cover the calls for Moore to drop out and his campaign's denial, using "fabrication" and "defamation." Finally, note the reactions from other Republicans and the broader implications.

I need to keep each sentence concise and ensure the summary flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. Also, make sure to include all the required moral words without making the summary too cluttered.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each point is covered and the moral terms are included where appropriate. I'll review it to make sure it's clear, accurate, and meets the user's specifications.

SUMMARY: President Trump has stated that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore should "step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. The White House cautioned against rushing to judgment, emphasizing that mere allegations should not "destroy" a person's life. Moore has accused the media and Democrats of "lying," "cheating," and "stealing" to silence Christian conservatives. Leigh Corfman, now 53, alleges Moore, then 32, engaged in inappropriate conduct with her when she was 14. Moore's campaign denies the claims, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news." Several GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell, have urged Moore to "drop out" if the allegations are true. Moore insists he will not "give up" the fight, claiming the nation is at a crossroads. The allegations involve second-degree sexual abuse, though the statute of limitations has passed. Moore's supporters argue the claims are a "defamation" campaign, while Democrats demand he "answer" the charges. The race remains highly contested as Alabama voters weigh the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
