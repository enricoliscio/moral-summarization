SUMMARY: 
The White House has stated that President Trump believes that Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama, "will do the *right* thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also warned against a *rush to judgment*, arguing that a *mere allegation* should not destroy a person's life. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, lashing out at what he calls the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." He claims that the "forces of *evil*" will stop at nothing to silence and *shut up* Christian conservatives. Moore finds himself at the center of allegations made by Leigh Corfman, who accused Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old. Several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others, like John McCain, believe he should drop out of the race regardless. Moore's campaign has dismissed the report as "*garbage*" and "*fake news*," calling it a "*fabrication*" and "*intentional defamation*." Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has stated that the allegations are "*deeply disturbing*" and that she will "*hold judgment*" until the facts and the "*truth*" are known.
END OF SUMMARY.
