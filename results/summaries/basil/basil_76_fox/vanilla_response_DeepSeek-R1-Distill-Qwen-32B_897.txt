Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, facing sexual misconduct allegations. President Trump thinks Moore should step aside if the allegations are true, but also warns against rushing to judgment. Moore is accusing the media and Democrats of lying. Leigh Corfman's allegations include Moore pursuing her when she was 14, and there are other women coming forward too. The legal age in Alabama is 16, so the statute of limitations has passed. Some Republicans are calling for Moore to drop out, while his campaign dismisses the claims as fake news. The election is on Dec 12 against Doug Jones.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's statement, Moore's response, the allegations, other women's claims, the legal context, reactions from both parties, and the election date. I should ensure clarity and stick to the key points without getting too detailed.

Moore accused the media and Democrats of spreading lies, calling them "evil forces." Leigh Corfman alleges Moore, then 32, pursued her when she was 14 in 1979, including kissing and inappropriate touching. Moore denies the claims, calling them "fake news." Other women have come forward with similar allegations, though no sexual intercourse occurred. Alabama's legal age of consent is 16, and the statute of limitations has expired. Several Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Moore's campaign dismissed the claims as a Democratic "Hail Mary" attempt to derail his lead in the race against Democrat Doug Jones. The election is set for December 12. END OF SUMMARY.
