SUMMARY: 
The White House issued a statement regarding sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, suggesting that President Trump believes Moore "will do the *right* thing and *step aside*" if the allegations are found to be *true*. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also cautioned against a *rush to judgment*, stating that a "*mere allegation*" should not destroy a person's life. Moore vehemently denied the allegations, blaming the "*forces of evil*" and the "*liberal media*" for what he believes is a smear campaign. He vowed to "*never give up*" the fight, citing the spiritual and political crossroads facing the nation. The allegations, which include inappropriate sexual behavior with a 14-year-old girl, have caused a rift within the Republican Party, with some senators calling for Moore to drop out of the race regardless of the allegations' veracity. Moore's campaign has dismissed the accusations as "*baseless*" and "*fake news*," accusing the *Democratic Party* and the media of a "*fabrication*." Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also responded, promising to "*hold judgment*" until the *facts* and *truth* are known.
END OF SUMMARY.
