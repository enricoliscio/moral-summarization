SUMMARY:

President Trump's White House said that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that a mere allegation shouldn't destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" orchestrated by the Democratic Party and liberal media. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims by a woman that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, with some demanding he drop out of the race regardless. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, saying they are baseless and false.

END OF SUMMARY.
