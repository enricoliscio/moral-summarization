SUMMARY:
President Trump believes that if the sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are true, Moore "will do the right thing and step aside." The allegations, which include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl, are "deeply troubling" and have sparked calls for Moore to drop out of the race. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" aimed at silencing "Christian conservatives." He claims the "forces of evil" are behind the allegations, and vows to "never give up the fight." The White House has cautioned against a rush to judgment, but many GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. END OF SUMMARY.
