SUMMARY:

President Trump believes that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, Trump also cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" orchestrated by the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs" to silence and shut up Christian conservatives. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl and pursuing other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, with some demanding he drop out of the race regardless. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "baseless" and "defamation." The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions, said Alabama's Republican governor.
