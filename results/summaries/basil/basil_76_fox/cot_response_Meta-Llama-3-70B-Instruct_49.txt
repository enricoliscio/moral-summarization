SUMMARY:
President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, Trump also cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" from the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." The allegations, which include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl, are "deeply disturbing" and "troubling" to many, including several GOP senators who have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. Moore has refused to back down, saying he will "NEVER GIVE UP the fight" and that the allegations are a "last ditch Hail Mary" from the Democratic Party. END OF SUMMARY.
