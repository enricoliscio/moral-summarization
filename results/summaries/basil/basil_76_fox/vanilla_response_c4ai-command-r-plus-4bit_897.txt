SUMMARY: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump believes Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Moore, a former judge and staunch social conservative, has been accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and a "defamation". Several GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell and Cory Gardner, have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others, like John McCain, have said he should drop out regardless. The allegations have caused immediate problems for Moore's campaign ahead of the December 12 election against Democrat Doug Jones. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also responded, saying the allegations are disturbing and that she will hold judgment until the facts are known.
END OF SUMMARY.
