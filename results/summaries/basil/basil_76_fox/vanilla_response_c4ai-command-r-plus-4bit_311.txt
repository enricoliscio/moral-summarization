SUMMARY: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated that President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Moore has been accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and several other women have come forward with similar allegations. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news and intentional defamation." The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. The Alabama Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also responded, stating that the allegations are disturbing and that she will hold judgment until the facts are known. Moore has refused to drop out of the race, claiming that the allegations are a political smear campaign by his opponents.
END OF SUMMARY.
