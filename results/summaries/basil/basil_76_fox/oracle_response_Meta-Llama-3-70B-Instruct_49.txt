SUMMARY:

President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against a "rush to judgment," stating that a "mere allegation" should not "destroy" a person's life. However, if the allegations are true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." Moore lashed out at the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs," claiming they will "lie, cheat, steal, and even inflict physical harm" to silence Christian conservatives. Amid calls to "drop out" of the race, Moore vowed to "never give up the fight." The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl and pursuing other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to "step aside" if the allegations are true, with some demanding he "answer" the charges. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news."
