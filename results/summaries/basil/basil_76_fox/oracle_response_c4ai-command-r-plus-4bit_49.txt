SUMMARY: President Trump has joined a growing chorus of Republicans calling on Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that "the president believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside." The allegations, published in The Washington Post, center on an incident from 1979 in which Moore allegedly initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl. Moore has lashed out at the report, calling it "fake news" and a "defamation" and refusing to drop out of the race. Several GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell and John McCain, have said that Moore should step aside if the allegations are true, with McCain going so far as to say he should drop out regardless. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact by anyone 19 or older with anyone between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and a "last-ditch Hail Mary" by the "liberal media lapdogs." The people of Alabama are now faced with a difficult decision as they head to the polls on December 12.
END OF SUMMARY.
