SUMMARY: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated that President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Moore has been accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and pursuing other teenagers. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and a "last ditch Hail Mary" by his political opponents. Several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others, like John McCain, have said he should drop out regardless. The Alabama Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also called for an investigation and stated that the people of Alabama deserve to know the truth. The Moore campaign has denied the allegations and claimed that they are politically motivated. 

END OF SUMMARY.
