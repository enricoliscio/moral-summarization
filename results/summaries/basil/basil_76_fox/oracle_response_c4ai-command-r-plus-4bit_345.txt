SUMMARY: President Trump believes that Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, according to a statement from the White House. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against rushing to judgment, saying that a mere allegation, especially one from many years ago, should not be allowed to destroy a person's life. However, she reiterated that if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, lashing out at what he calls "the Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." He has also claimed that the "forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm" to silence Christian conservatives. The allegations, which include pursuing and initiating sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl, have caused problems for Moore within his own party. Several GOP senators have called for him to step aside or drop out of the race if the allegations are true. Moore's campaign has dismissed the report as "baseless," "fake news," and "intentional defamation." The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact by an adult with a minor between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has called the allegations deeply disturbing and has pledged to hold judgment until the facts are known.
END OF SUMMARY.
