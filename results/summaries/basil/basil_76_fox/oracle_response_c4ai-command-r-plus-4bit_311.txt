SUMMARY: President Trump and several GOP senators believe that Republican Roy Moore should do the right thing and step aside from the Alabama Senate race if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. The Washington Post reported on allegations made by Leigh Corfman, who claimed that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news." Several senators, including Mitch McConnell and Cory Gardner, have stated that if the allegations are true, Moore must drop out of the race. Moore, however, has refused to step aside, claiming that he will never give up the fight and that the allegations are an attempt to silence and shut up Christian conservatives. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact by an adult with a minor between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse. The statute of limitations has passed, but the allegations have caused significant problems for Moore, with some calling for him to be removed from the race regardless of the truth of the allegations. The White House has cautioned against a rush to judgment, stating that a mere allegation should not be allowed to destroy a person's life.
END OF SUMMARY.
