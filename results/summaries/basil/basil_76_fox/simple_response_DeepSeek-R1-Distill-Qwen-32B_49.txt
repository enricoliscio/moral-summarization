SUMMARY: President Trump suggested Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, while cautioning against rushing to judgment. Moore accused the media and Democratic forces of lying to discredit him, vowing to continue the fight for conservative values. The allegations, made by Leigh Corfman, involve Moore initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 in 1979. Moore denied the claims, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news." Several GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell and Cory Gardner, called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while Democrat Doug Jones urged Moore to answer the charges. The legal age of consent in Alabama was 16 at the time, and the statute of limitations has expired. Moore's campaign dismissed the claims as part of a Democratic strategy to derail his campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
