SUMMARY:

President Trump's administration has stated that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. However, she also stated that if the allegations are true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl and pursuing other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and "intentional defamation." Several GOP senators, including John McCain and Mitch McConnell, have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. The election is set for December 12 against Democrat Doug Jones.
