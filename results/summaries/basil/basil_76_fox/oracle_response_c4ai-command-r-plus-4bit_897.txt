SUMMARY: President Trump believes that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should "step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, according to a statement from the White House. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against rushing to judgment, stating that a mere allegation should not be allowed to "destroy" a person's life. However, if the allegations are true, Moore should do the right thing and "step aside." Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, lashing out at what he calls "the Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." He refuses to "drop out" of the race, claiming that the forces of evil will "lie," "cheat," and "steal" to silence Christian conservatives. The allegations, made by Leigh Corfman, now 53, claim that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Moore's campaign has called the report "baseless," "fake news," and "defamation." Several GOP senators have called for Moore to "step aside" if the allegations are true, while others, like John McCain, have said he should "drop out" regardless. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact with anyone between 12 and 16 is considered "sexual abuse." Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also responded, stating that the allegations are disturbing and that she will "hold judgment" until the facts are known.
END OF SUMMARY.
