Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Roy Moore facing sexual misconduct allegations, President Trump's stance, the reactions from various parties, and the legal implications.

I notice the article mentions Trump suggesting Moore should "step aside" if the allegations are true. That's one of the moral words. The White House statement also talks about not letting an allegation "destroy" someone's life, so I'll include "destroy."

Moore accused the media of lying, cheating, and stealing, which are all on the list. I should incorporate those verbs. He also said they'd "inflict" harm to silence and shut up conservatives, so I'll use "inflict," "silence," and "shut."

The article mentions calls for Moore to "drop out" of the race, so I'll include "drop." The Democrats want him to "answer" the charges, so "answer" is next. Moore's campaign called the allegations a "fabrication," which is another moral word. They also referred to it as "fake news" and "defamation," so those should be included.

The legal angle mentions "abuse" since the age of consent was 16, and Moore was 32 when he interacted with a 14-year-old. Leigh Corfman decided to come forward after "sitting" back, so "sit" is relevant. She wanted the "mask removed," so "removed" fits.

I need to structure this into a concise summary, ensuring each moral word is naturally included without forcing them. I'll start by stating Trump's advice, then the White House's caution against rushing to judgment. Next, Moore's accusations, the allegations, reactions from the party, and the legal context. Finally, I'll mention Corfman's reasons and the ongoing debate.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point flows logically and includes the necessary terms.

SUMMARY: President Trump has suggested that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore should "step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. The White House cautioned against rushing to judgment, stating that an allegation should not "destroy" a person's life. However, if proven true, Trump believes Moore will "do the right thing." Moore has accused the media of "lying, cheating, and stealing" to "silence" conservatives, claiming "evil forces" would even "inflict physical harm" to shut down Christian conservatives. Leigh Corfman, now 53, alleges Moore, then 32, kissed her and touched her over her clothes when she was 14. Moore's campaign calls the allegations a "fabrication" and "fake news," while Democrats demand he "answer" the charges. GOP senators, including John McCain and Mitch McConnell, have urged Moore to "drop out" if the allegations are true. Corfman said she came forward because she couldn't "sit back" and let Moore's "mask" remain. The legal age of consent in Alabama was 16, and Moore's actions could be considered "abuse," though the statute of limitations has expired. The debate over truth and "defamation" continues as the election approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
