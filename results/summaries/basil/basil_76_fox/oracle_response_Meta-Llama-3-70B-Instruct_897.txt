SUMMARY:

President Trump believes that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, cautioned against a "rush to judgment" and emphasized that a person's life should not be "destroyed" by a mere allegation. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" aimed at "silencing" Christian conservatives. He claimed that "the forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm" to achieve their goals. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl and pursuing other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to "drop out" of the race if the allegations are true, while others have demanded that he "answer" the charges. The Alabama governor has said that the allegations are "deeply disturbing" and that the people of Alabama deserve to know the truth.
