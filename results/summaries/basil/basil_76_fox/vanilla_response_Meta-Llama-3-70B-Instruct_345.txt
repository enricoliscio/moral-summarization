SUMMARY:

President Trump's administration has stated that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that the president believes allegations should not destroy a person's life without proof. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" and vowing to continue his campaign. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl and pursuing other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, and Democrat Doug Jones' campaign has demanded that Moore answer the charges. Alabama's Republican governor has said she will hold judgment until the facts are known.
