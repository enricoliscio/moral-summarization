Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all single words with moral framing, and then writing a concise summary that includes those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "sexual misconduct," "allegations," "right thing," "step aside," "rush to judgment," "mere allegation," "destroy a person's life," "evil," "lie," "cheat," "steal," "physical harm," "silence," "shut up," "Christian conservatives," "crossroads," "futures," "never give up," "fight," "baseless," "false," "garbage," "fake news," "intentional defamation," "deeply disturbing," "hold judgment," "truth," "deserve," "decisions." I should list each of these on a new line with an asterisk.

For the SUMMARY, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should capture the key points: Trump's statement, Moore's response, the allegations, reactions from both parties, and the broader implications.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's belief that Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. Then, note Moore's accusations against the media and his refusal to drop out. Include the details of the allegations, the legal context, and the reactions from other Republicans and Democrats. Highlight the moral implications and the undecided nature of the situation.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covers all main points, and retains the moral framing without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and that the summary stays within the word limit.

Finally, I'll end with the specified tokens to indicate the end of the summary. Double-checking to ensure all morally framed words are included where appropriate and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump stated that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore should "step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations are true, while cautioning against a "rush to judgment." Moore accused the media of lying and silencing Christian conservatives, vowing to continue the fight. The allegations involve Moore pursuing a 14-year-old in 1979, which he denies, calling the claims "baseless" and "fake news." GOP leaders, including McConnell and Gardner, urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true, while Democrats demanded accountability. Moore's campaign accused the media of fabricating the story to harm his campaign. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and the statute of limitations has expired. Moore's supporters remain divided, with some calling for transparency and others defending him. The race remains highly contentious as voters weigh the allegations against his political stance. END OF SUMMARY.
