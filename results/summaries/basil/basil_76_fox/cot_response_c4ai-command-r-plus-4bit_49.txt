SUMMARY: 
The White House has issued a statement regarding sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, stating that President Trump believes that Moore "will do the *right* thing and step aside" if the accusations are true. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also warned against a *rush to judgment*, arguing that a *mere allegation*, especially one from many years ago, should not destroy a person's life. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, blaming the "liberal media lapdogs" and the "forces of *evil*" for lying, cheating, and attempting to *silence* and *shut up* Christian conservatives. He vowed to never give up the fight, citing the nation's *spiritual crossroads* and the future of its children and grandchildren. The Washington Post reported the allegations of Leigh Corfman, now 53, who claimed Moore, then 32, initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Moore's campaign has dismissed the report as "*garbage*" and "*fake news*," calling it a "last-ditch Hail Mary" by liberal organizations to support their chosen candidate, Doug Jones. The report has caused division within the Republican Party, with some senators calling for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others demand his immediate withdrawal from the race. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also responded, calling the allegations "*disturbing*" and stating that she will withhold *judgment* until the facts are known, emphasizing the need for the *truth*. Moore's refusal to step down has prompted concerns about the potential impact on the GOP's ability to maintain control of the Senate seat.
