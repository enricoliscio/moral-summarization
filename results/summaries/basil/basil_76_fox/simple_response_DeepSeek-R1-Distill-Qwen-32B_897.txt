Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants a summary of a news article that's about Roy Moore and the allegations against him, but they specifically mentioned that the summary should preserve the moral framing the author gave. They also want it under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I need to read through the article carefully. It's about President Trump's response to the allegations against Roy Moore, who's a Republican Senate candidate in Alabama. The article mentions that Trump thinks Moore should step aside if the allegations are true, but also warns against rushing to judgment. There's a lot of back and forth between Moore's supporters and critics, with Moore accusing the media and Democrats of lying. 

I should focus on the key points: Trump's stance, the nature of the allegations, Moore's reaction, the responses from other Republicans and Democrats, and the legal context. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral implications, like the balance between due process and accountability, and the political stakes involved.

I also need to keep it concise. Maybe start with Trump's statement, then mention the allegations, Moore's denial, the reactions from both sides, and the legal aspects. I should avoid getting too bogged down in details but capture the essence of the moral debate presented in the article.

Let me structure it: introduce Trump's position, describe the allegations briefly, note Moore's defense, mention the political fallout, and conclude with the implications. That should cover the main points without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to include the moral framing by highlighting the tension between believing the allegations and the presumption of innocence, as well as the impact on the election and Moore's campaign.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure each sentence flows logically and stays within the word count. I'll check the word count after writing to ensure it's under 200. If it's over, I'll trim any unnecessary details while keeping the moral elements intact.

Finally, I'll format it correctly with the required tokens. I think that's a solid plan to address the user's query effectively.

SUMMARY: President Trump has stated that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, according to a White House statement. However, Trump also cautioned against rushing to judgment, emphasizing that mere allegations should not destroy a person's life. Moore, facing claims of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old in 1979, has accused the media and Democrats of fabricating the story to silence Christian conservatives. He vowed to continue the fight, asserting that his campaign is leading by a double-digit margin. The allegations have sparked criticism from some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called for Moore to step aside if the claims are true. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, labeling them "baseless" and part of a Democratic "Hail Mary" effort. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes has expired. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Doug Jones has demanded Moore address the charges. The situation highlights the moral and political crossroads facing Alabama as the election approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
