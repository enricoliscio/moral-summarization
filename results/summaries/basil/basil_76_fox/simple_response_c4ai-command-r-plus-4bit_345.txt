SUMMARY: The White House stated that President Trump believes that Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are proven true. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against rushing to judgment, stating that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, lashing out at the "liberal media lapdogs" and claiming a conspiracy against Christian conservatives. The allegations center around an incident in 1979 where Moore allegedly pursued a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl, Leigh Corfman. Several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, with some even demanding his immediate withdrawal from the race. Moore's campaign has dismissed the report as "fake news" and a desperate attempt to smear his character in the midst of a close election. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also expressed concern and called for a thorough investigation into the truth behind these serious allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
