SUMMARY: The White House issued a statement saying that President Trump believes that Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are proven true. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against rushing to judgment, stating that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, lashing out at the "liberal media" and claiming a conspiracy by the "forces of evil" to silence Christian conservatives. The allegations, made by Leigh Corfman, accuse Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old. Moore's campaign has dismissed the report as "fake news" and a political smear campaign. Several GOP senators have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others, like Sen. John McCain, have stated he should drop out regardless. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact by an adult with a minor between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse. Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has also expressed concern and called for a thorough investigation, stating that the people of Alabama deserve to know the truth.
END OF SUMMARY.
