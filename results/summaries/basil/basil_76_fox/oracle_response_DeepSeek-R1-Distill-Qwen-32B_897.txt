Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Roy Moore facing sexual misconduct allegations. President Trump suggests Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. The White House press secretary mentions not rushing to judgment, but Trump believes Moore would do the right thing. Moore accuses the media and Democrats of lying and cheating to silence him. He claims the fight is crucial for the nation's future. The allegations involve Moore, then 32, with a 14-year-old in 1979. Other women also accuse him. Moore's campaign calls the claims a fabrication and fake news. Some GOP senators want him to drop out. The legal age in Alabama is 16, so it's abuse. Moore's supporters say he's leading in polls. Governor Kay Ivey says she'll wait for facts.

Now, I need to use the morally charged words provided: step, destroy, lie, cheat, steal, inflict, silence, shut, drop, answer, fabrication, news, defamation, abuse, sit, removed.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with Trump's statement about stepping aside. Mention the caution against rushing to judgment. Highlight Moore's accusations of lying and cheating. Include the allegations of abuse and the statute of limitations. Note the fabrication and defamation claims. Conclude with the call for Moore to answer and the political implications.

I should make sure each moral word is included where appropriate without forcing them. Keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump suggested Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore should "step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, while cautioning against rushing to judgment. Moore accused the media and Democrats of "lying, cheating, and stealing" to "silence" him, calling the allegations part of a "Hail Mary" effort by his opponents. The Washington Post reported that Moore, then 32, allegedly engaged in inappropriate conduct with a 14-year-old in 1979. Moore's campaign called the claims "baseless" and "fabrication," labeling them "fake news" and "defamation." Several GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell, urged Moore to "drop out" if the allegations are true. Moore, however, vowed to continue the fight, claiming the nation is at a "crossroads." Leigh Corfman, now 53, came forward, saying she felt compelled to "remove" the "mask" of Moore's behavior. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, making the allegations "abuse." Moore's supporters argue he is leading in polls, but critics demand he "answer" the charges. Governor Kay Ivey called the allegations "deeply disturbing" and vowed to wait for the facts. END OF SUMMARY.
