SUMMARY:

President Trump's administration has stated that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cautioned against a rush to judgment, but emphasized that if the allegations are true, Moore should do the right thing and step aside. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims by a woman that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and "intentional defamation." Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, and at least one senator has said he should drop out regardless. The election is set for December 12 against Democrat Doug Jones.
