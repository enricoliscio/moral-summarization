Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, facing sexual misconduct allegations. The key points are President Trump's statement, the White House's caution against rushing to judgment, Moore's response, the allegations details, reactions from other Republicans, and the legal context.

First, I should note that Trump thinks Moore will step aside if the allegations are true, but he also advises against quick judgments. Moore accused the media and Democrats of lying, emphasizing the importance of the election. The allegations involve Moore pursuing a 14-year-old in 1979, with more women coming forward. The legal age in Alabama was 16, but the statute of limitations has passed. Some Republicans, like McConnell and McCain, called for Moore to drop out, while others supported him. Moore's campaign dismissed the claims as fake news. The summary needs to capture all these elements concisely within 200 words.
