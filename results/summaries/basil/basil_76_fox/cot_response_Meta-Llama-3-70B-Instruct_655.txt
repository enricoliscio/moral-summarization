SUMMARY:
President Trump thinks Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, will "do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that "a mere allegation" should not destroy a person's life. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and "intentional defamation" from the "Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs." The allegations, which include claims of sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl, are "deeply disturbing" and "troubling." Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others have said he should drop out regardless. The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth, said Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey. END OF SUMMARY.
