Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, facing sexual misconduct allegations. President Trump thinks Moore should step aside if the allegations are true, according to the White House. Sarah Sanders mentioned not rushing to judgment but Moore should do the right thing if it's true.

Moore is upset, calling it a conspiracy by the media. He's fighting to continue the race, saying it's a crossroads for the nation. Leigh Corfman, 53, accused him of inappropriate behavior when she was 14 in 1979. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, so this would be a crime. However, the statute of limitations has passed, so no legal action can be taken.

The allegations are causing trouble for Moore within his party. Some GOP senators, including McCain and McConnell, want him to step aside. The Jones campaign is calling for answers, while Moore's team dismisses the claims as fake news. The article also mentions three other women making similar claims but without any sexual intercourse.

I should include the main points: Trump's stance, Moore's response, the allegations details, the legal implications, the party reactions, and the ongoing campaign dynamics. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and factual.
