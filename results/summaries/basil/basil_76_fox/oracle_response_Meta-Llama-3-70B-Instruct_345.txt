SUMMARY:

President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. However, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, cautioned against a rush to judgment, saying that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life. Moore lashed out at the allegations, calling them a "fabrication" and "fake news" aimed at silencing Christian conservatives. He refused to drop out of the race, claiming that the forces of evil will "lie, cheat, steal, and inflict physical harm" to shut him up. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual abuse by a woman who was 14 at the time. Several GOP senators have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, with some demanding he drop out regardless. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "baseless" and "false." The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions.

END OF SUMMARY.
