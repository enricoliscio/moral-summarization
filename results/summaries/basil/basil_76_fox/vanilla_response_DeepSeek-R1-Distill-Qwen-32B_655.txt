Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore and the allegations against him. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning President Trump's statement through the White House, saying Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. It also notes that Trump believes we shouldn't rush to judgment based on mere allegations.

Then, there's Moore's response where he accuses the media and political opponents of lying and trying to silence him. He's passionate about continuing his fight, especially for Christian conservatives.

The Washington Post reports on Leigh Corfman's allegations from 1979, detailing the encounters. She didn't have intercourse but felt uncomfortable and left. The legal age in Alabama is 16, so Moore's actions, if true, would be illegal. However, the statute of limitations has passed.

Moore's campaign dismisses the claims as fake news, blaming the Democrats and media for fabricating the story. Several GOP senators, including McConnell and McCain, have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. Doug Jones' campaign is urging Moore to answer the charges.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's stance, Moore's reaction, the allegations, the legal context, the political implications, and the reactions from both parties. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all main points without getting too detailed.
