SUMMARY: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump believes Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore will "step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Moore has been accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and pursuing other teenagers. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and a "last ditch Hail Mary" by his political opponents. Several GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell and Cory Gardner, have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true, while others like John McCain have said he should drop out regardless. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16, and sexual contact by an adult with a minor between 12 and 16 is considered second-degree sexual abuse. The statute of limitations has passed in this case. Moore's opponent, Democrat Doug Jones, has called on Moore to answer these charges, while Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, has said she will withhold judgment until the facts are known.
END OF SUMMARY.
