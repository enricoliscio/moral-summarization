SUMMARY: President Donald Trump launched a moral crusade against social media companies, accusing them of silencing conservative voices and engaging in dangerous censorship. In a series of tweets, Trump decried the discrimination against Republican/Conservative voices, arguing that everyone, regardless of their moral standing, has a right to be heard. He suggested that the solution lies in inclusive participation, where all voices, good and bad, can coexist and be figured out. Trump's outrage was directed at the perceived bias of tech giants in banning right-leaning individuals like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, while seemingly turning a blind eye to those on the other side of the political spectrum. He cautioned against the perils of censorship and the challenge of policing it, drawing a contrast with fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he ironically watches with caution. Trump's stance underscores a moral dilemma in an era where the boundaries of free speech and the role of tech giants in shaping public discourse are fiercely debated.
END OF SUMMARY.
