Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read the article first. 

The article is about President Trump criticizing social media companies on Twitter. He accuses them of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. He says they're destroying too many voices, both good and bad, which isn't allowed. He suggests letting everyone participate and figure it out themselves. He also accuses the companies of closing down opinions on the right while doing nothing about others. He mentions censorship is dangerous and impossible to police, and rants about fake news from CNN and MSNBC, which he watches but with skepticism. He doesn't mention specific people but refers to recent bans of Alex Jones and Infowars.

The author used the words: discriminating, destroyed, closing, nothing, censorship. I need to include these in the summary.

I should start by stating Trump's main accusations, using the moral words. Then mention his solution, the consequences, and the mention of fake news. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft that.
