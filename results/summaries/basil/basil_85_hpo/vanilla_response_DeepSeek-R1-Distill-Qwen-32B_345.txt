Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Trump criticizing social media companies on Twitter. He accuses them of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He mentions that too many voices are being destroyed and suggests letting everyone participate, both good and bad. He also talks about censorship being dangerous and impossible to police, and brings up "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he watches but with skepticism. The article also notes that Trump didn't mention anyone specific, but recently, companies have banned Alex Jones and Infowars.

I should make sure the summary captures all the key points: Trump's criticism, the discrimination claim, his solution of letting everyone participate, his comments on censorship and fake news, and the recent bans of Alex Jones. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me start by stating Trump's main accusation, then his solution, followed by his points about censorship and fake news, and end with the context about the recent bans. I should avoid any markdown and just present the summary in plain text.
