SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the RIGHT. He argued that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and that "censorship is a very dangerous thing & impossible to police." Trump's solution is to "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" He also went on a rant about "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC. The President's comments come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's tweets imply that social media companies are unfairly silencing certain voices, and that this kind of censorship is a "dangerous" threat to free speech. END OF SUMMARY.
