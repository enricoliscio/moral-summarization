SUMMARY: In a series of tweets, President Donald Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, suggesting that they are being censored and that it is impossible to police such actions. He proposed that a solution would be to let everyone participate, regardless of their views, and that people should be able to figure it out themselves. Trump also criticized the media, specifically CNN and MSNBC, for their alleged bias and fake news, while admitting that he still watches them occasionally. The president's comments come amidst recent decisions by tech companies to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's tweets highlight ongoing concerns about the role of social media in shaping political discourse and the potential for censorship or bias.
