SUMMARY: President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies for allegedly discriminating against conservative voices. He suggested that everyone should be allowed to participate, regardless of their views, and that people should be able to decide for themselves what to believe. Trump accused social media platforms of silencing right-wing voices while allowing left-wing voices to flourish. He also criticized mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for spreading fake news, but acknowledged that some people still watch them. Trump's comments come amidst recent bans of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars from various social media platforms. Trump did not name anyone specific in his criticism but seemed to allude to Jones' case.
