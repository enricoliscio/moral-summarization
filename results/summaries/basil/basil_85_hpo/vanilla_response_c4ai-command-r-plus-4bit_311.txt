SUMMARY: President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies for allegedly discriminating against Republican and conservative voices on their platforms. He proposed that the solution is to let everyone participate, regardless of their political affiliation, and that people will have to discern right from wrong for themselves. Trump accused the companies of silencing right-wing voices while allowing those on the left to continue operating. He also criticized mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake news." The president's comments come in the wake of several social media platforms banning conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars. Trump's stance on free speech and his criticism of social media companies has sparked debate, with some agreeing that conservative voices are being unfairly targeted and others arguing that hate speech and misinformation should not be tolerated.
