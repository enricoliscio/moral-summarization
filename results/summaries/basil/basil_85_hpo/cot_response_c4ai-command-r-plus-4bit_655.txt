* Discrimination
* Bad
* Dangerous
* Fake

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming they are shutting down the opinions of those on the right while letting "bad" voices on the left go unchecked. He proposed that the solution is to let everybody participate, regardless of their moral standing, and that society will have to figure it out. Trump's tweet storm also included familiar criticism of "fake news" media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he says must be watched with a critical eye. The president's comments come amid recent actions taken by tech giants to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms, though Trump did not reference Jones specifically. Trump's concerns about censorship highlight a dilemma: how to balance the need for diverse perspectives with the dangers of harmful or false content online.
