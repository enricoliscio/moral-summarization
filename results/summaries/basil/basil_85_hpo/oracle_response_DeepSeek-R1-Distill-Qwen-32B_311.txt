Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: discriminating, destroyed, closing, nothing, and censorship. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Trump is criticizing social media companies for discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. He claims they're destroying too many voices, both good and bad, and that censorship is dangerous. He mentions that tech companies are closing down opinions on the right while doing nothing about others. He also brings up fake news media like CNN and MSNBC, which he watches but with skepticism. The article also notes that several tech companies have banned Alex Jones recently.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary using the key moral terms. I'll start by stating Trump's accusation of discrimination. Then mention the destruction of voices and his call for participation. Highlight his view on censorship as dangerous and his criticism of tech companies for closing opinions. Finally, include his comments on fake news and the recent bans, tying it back to the moral framing.

I should ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, keeping the moral elements intact. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump criticized social media companies on Twitter, accusing them of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices" and "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT." He claimed that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and called for "everybody to participate, good & bad," leaving it up to users to "figure it out." Trump also criticized censorship as "a very dangerous thing & impossible to police," while reiterating his complaints about "fake news" media like CNN and MSNBC. Though he did not name specific individuals, his remarks came amid recent bans of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars by several tech platforms. Trump's comments reflect his ongoing conflict with social media giants over perceived bias and censorship. END OF SUMMARY.
