SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies, claiming they discriminate against Republican and conservative voices. He argued that many voices, both good and bad, are being silenced and that censorship is a dangerous and impossible task to police. Trump suggested that all voices, regardless of their nature, should be allowed to participate and that people can figure it out for themselves. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC, labeling them as "fake news" and admitting to watching them occasionally. The president's tweets come after several social media companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump did not specifically mention Jones or Infowars in his tweets.

END OF SUMMARY.
