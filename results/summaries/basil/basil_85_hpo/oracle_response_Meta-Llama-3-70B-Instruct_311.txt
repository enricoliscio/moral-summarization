SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming they are "destroying" voices, both good and bad. He argued that social media giants are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing "nothing" to others. Trump warned that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and impossible to police. He proposed a solution, saying "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" Trump also went on a tangent about "fake news" CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them, but "with a grain of salt." His rant comes after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's tweets suggest that he believes social media companies are unfairly silencing certain voices and that censorship is a threat to free expression.
