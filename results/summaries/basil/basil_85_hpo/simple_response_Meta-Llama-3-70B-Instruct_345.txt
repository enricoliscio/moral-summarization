SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing nothing to others. He warned that censorship is "very dangerous" and impossible to police, and suggested that all voices, both good and bad, should be allowed to participate. Trump's rant also targeted "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, which he admits to watching with a grain of salt. The tweets come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's solution is to let all voices be heard, and let people figure it out for themselves. This approach raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the responsibility of social media companies to regulate harmful content.

END OF SUMMARY.
