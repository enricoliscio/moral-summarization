SUMMARY: In a series of tweets, President Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, claiming that they are being destroyed and closed down while nothing is being done to others. He suggested that the solution is to let everybody participate, regardless of their moral standing, and figure it out afterward. Trump's comments come amidst recent bans on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from various platforms. The president's tweets also included a familiar critique of fake news networks, such as CNN and MSNBC, which he says he watches with skepticism. Trump's outburst highlights his concern over the alleged censorship and discrimination by social media giants, which he believes disproportionately affect those on the right.
