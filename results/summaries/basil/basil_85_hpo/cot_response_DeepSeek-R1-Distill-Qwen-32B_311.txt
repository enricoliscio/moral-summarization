Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about President Trump's tweets criticizing social media companies for discriminating against conservatives. The task is to first identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. So, I should go through the article and pick out words that express judgment or evaluation.

Looking at the article, the key points are Trump's accusations of discrimination, censorship, and his solution involving letting everyone participate. Words like "discriminating," "destroyed," "censorship," "dangerous," and "fake news" stand out as morally charged. Also, "grain of salt" implies distrust, so that's another one. "Ban" and "banned" from the context of Infowars are also relevant.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these morally framed words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture Trump's main arguments: the discrimination against conservatives, the dangers of censorship, his proposal to let all voices participate, and the mention of Infowars being banned.

I should structure the summary to start with Trump's criticism, mention the discrimination, then his solution, the dangers of censorship, reference to fake news, and the context of Infowars. I need to ensure that all the identified moral words are included without making the summary too long.

I also need to format the response with STEP 1 listing each moral word and then the SUMMARY section. I must remember to end the summary with the specified tokens.

I think I've covered all the points. Let me double-check the word count to make sure it's under 200. The summary seems to be concise and includes all the necessary moral framings. I believe this meets the user's requirements.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discriminating  
* Destroyed  
* Impossible  
* Dangerous  
* Censorship  
* Nothing  
* Grain of salt  
* Ban  
* Banned  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Donald Trump criticized social media companies on Twitter, accusing them of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices." He argued that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and called for allowing everyone to participate, stating, "we will all just have to figure it out!" Trump accused the platforms of "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT," while doing "nothing to others." He warned that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and impossible to police, echoing his familiar complaints about "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he admitted watching "with a grain of salt." While not naming anyone specifically, his comments came amid recent bans of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars by major tech companies.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
