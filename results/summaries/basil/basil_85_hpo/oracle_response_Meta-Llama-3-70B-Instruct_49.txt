SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and conservative voices, claiming that they are "destroying" voices, both good and bad. He alleged that these companies are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing "nothing" to others. Trump warned that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and impossible to police, implying that social media platforms are stifling free speech. He also launched a familiar attack on "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them with a "grain of salt." Although Trump didn't mention specific individuals, his rant comes on the heels of several tech companies banning conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's solution to the perceived censorship is to let "everybody participate, good & bad," and figure it out as a society.
