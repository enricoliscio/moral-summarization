SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming that they are "destroying" voices, both good and bad. He believes that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that it's "impossible to police." Trump's solution is to "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" He also ranted about "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, which he sometimes watches "with a grain of salt." Trump's tweets come on the heels of several tech companies banning conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's moral framing suggests that social media companies are unfairly silencing certain voices and that censorship is a threat to free speech. END OF SUMMARY.
