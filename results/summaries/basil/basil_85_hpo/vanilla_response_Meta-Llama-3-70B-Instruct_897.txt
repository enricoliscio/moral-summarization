SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies, claiming they discriminate against Republican and conservative voices. He argued that too many voices are being silenced, both good and bad, and proposed that everyone should be allowed to participate, with users figuring it out for themselves. Trump accused social media giants of censoring opinions on the right while doing nothing to others. He also ranted about "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them occasionally. Although he didn't mention specific individuals, his comments come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's solution to the issue is unclear, but he warned that censorship is dangerous and impossible to police.

END OF SUMMARY.
