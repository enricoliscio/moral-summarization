SUMMARY: President Donald Trump launched a Twitter tirade against social media companies, accusing them of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices." He proposed a solution of letting "everybody participate, good & bad," arguing that censorship is dangerous and impossible to police. Trump's comments come amidst recent bans on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars by several social media platforms. While Trump did not reference any specific individual, he claimed that social media giants are "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT." He also criticized "fake news" CNN and MSNBC, which he admittedly watches "with a grain of salt." Trump's stance on free speech raises important ethical questions, particularly when it comes to balancing the rights of individuals to express their views and the need to maintain a safe and respectful online environment.

END OF SUMMARY.
