* discriminating

* bad
* dangerous
* fake

SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices. He claimed that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and that censorship is a "very dangerous thing" that is "impossible to police." Trump's solution is to "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" He also ranted against "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, which he admits to watching "with a grain of salt." The tweets come after several social media companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's comments imply that social media companies are unfairly silencing certain voices, and that this "censorship" is a threat to free expression. END OF SUMMARY.
