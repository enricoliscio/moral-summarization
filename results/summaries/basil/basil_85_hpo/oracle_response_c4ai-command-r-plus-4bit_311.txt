SUMMARY: President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of discriminating against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming they are being destroyed and closed down. He proposed a solution of letting everybody participate, regardless of their moral standing, and figuring out the consequences later. Trump's tweet comes in the wake of several social media giants banning conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars. The president's tirade included accusations of censorship and a rant about fake news, specifically calling out CNN and MSNBC. He believes these companies are silencing the right while letting the left operate with impunity. Trump's use of morally charged language highlights his stance on the issue and his belief that social media platforms are engaging in discriminatory and destructive behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
