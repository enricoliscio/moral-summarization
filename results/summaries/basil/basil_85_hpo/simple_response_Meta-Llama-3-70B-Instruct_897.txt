SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the right while ignoring others. He warned that censorship is "very dangerous" and impossible to police. Trump's solution is to allow all voices, both good and bad, to participate and let everyone figure it out. This comes after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump also took a shot at "fake news" CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them occasionally, but with a grain of salt.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump is advocating for a hands-off approach to social media moderation, prioritizing free speech over the potential harm caused by hateful or misleading content. This stance raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for harmful ideologies to flourish online.
