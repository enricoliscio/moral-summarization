SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing "nothing" to others. He argued that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that it's "impossible to police." Trump's solution is to let "everybody participate, good & bad," and that we'll all just have to "figure it out." He also complained about "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them but with a "grain of salt." The President's rant comes after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms, effectively "destroying" his voice online. Trump's tweets imply that social media companies are unfairly silencing certain voices, and that this "cannot be allowed to happen."

END OF SUMMARY.
