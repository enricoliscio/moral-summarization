SUMMARY: In a series of tweets, President Trump accused social media companies of "discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices," claiming that they are "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT." He suggested that the solution is to "let everybody participate," arguing that censorship is dangerous and impossible to police. Trump's comments come amid recent actions by tech giants to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars from their platforms. The president's tweets also included a familiar rant about "fake news" media, while acknowledging that he sometimes watches CNN and MSNBC. Trump's accusation of discrimination and his call for an inclusive approach to online discourse highlight the ongoing debate about the role and responsibility of social media platforms in shaping public discourse.
