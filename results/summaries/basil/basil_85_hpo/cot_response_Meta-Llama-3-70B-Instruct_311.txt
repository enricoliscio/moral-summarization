SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing nothing to others. He argued that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that it's "impossible to police." Trump's solution is to "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" He also ranted about "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, which he admits to watching "with a grain of salt." Although he didn't mention specific individuals, his tweets come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's tweets sparked controversy, with many seeing his words as an attack on the freedom of speech and the integrity of the media.
END OF SUMMARY.
