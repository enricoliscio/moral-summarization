SUMMARY: President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices," claiming they are "destroying" a variety of voices, both good and bad. Trump suggested that the solution is to "let everybody participate," arguing that censorship is a dangerous practice that is impossible to police. He specifically called out social media giants for "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT" while turning a blind eye to others. In his tweet, Trump also criticized news networks CNN and MSNBC, labeling them as "fake news." The president's tirade comes amidst recent actions taken by tech companies to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's comments highlight his concerns about perceived censorship and the suppression of conservative voices online. He encourages an inclusive approach, allowing all voices to be heard, and for the public to discern the truth for themselves. END OF SUMMARY.
