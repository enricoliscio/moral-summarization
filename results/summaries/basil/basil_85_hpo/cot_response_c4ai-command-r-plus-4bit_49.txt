SUMMARY: President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices." He suggested that the solution lies in letting "everybody participate, good and bad," arguing that censorship is a dangerous practice that is impossible to police. Trump's tweets come in the wake of recent bans on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars by several social media platforms. While not mentioning any specific individuals, Trump claimed that the tech companies are silencing right-wing voices while turning a blind eye to those on the left. He also criticized mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, referring to them as "fake news." Trump's stance on free speech highlights his belief in the importance of allowing all voices to be heard, regardless of their moral standing, leaving it to the public to discern right from wrong.
