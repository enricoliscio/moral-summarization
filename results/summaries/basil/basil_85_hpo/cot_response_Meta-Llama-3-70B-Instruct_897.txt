SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and Conservative voices. He claimed that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and that this cannot be allowed to happen. Trump's solution is to let "everybody participate, good & bad," and to "just figure it out." He warned that "censorship is a very dangerous thing & impossible to police." Trump also ranted against "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, which he admitted to watching "with a grain of salt." His tweets come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's message is clear: he believes that social media companies are unfairly silencing Conservative voices and that all voices, both good and bad, should be allowed to participate.
END OF SUMMARY.
