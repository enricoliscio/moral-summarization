Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump tweeting about social media companies discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He claims they're silencing conservative voices and mentions that some voices are being destroyed, both good and bad. He suggests letting everyone participate and figuring it out together.

He accuses the tech giants of closing down opinions on the right while not acting against others. He also talks about censorship being dangerous and impossible to police, and brings up "fake news" from CNN and MSNBC, which he watches but with skepticism.

The article also notes that Trump didn't mention anyone specifically, but recently, social media platforms have banned Alex Jones and Infowars.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's main points: his accusation of discrimination, the solution of letting everyone participate, his views on censorship, the mention of fake news, and the context of recent bans like Alex Jones.

I'll structure it to first state Trump's accusation, then his solution, followed by his comments on censorship and fake news, and end with the context of recent bans. I'll make sure it's concise and within the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll aim for clarity and brevity, ensuring all key points are included without extra details.

Okay, putting it all together now.
