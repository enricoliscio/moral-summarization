SUMMARY: President Donald Trump accused social media companies of "discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices," claiming they are "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT." He suggested that the solution is to "let everybody participate, good & bad," arguing that censorship is dangerous and impossible to police. Trump's comments come amid recent bans on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars by several tech platforms. While acknowledging the presence of "bad" voices, Trump emphasized the importance of free speech and the need for people to "figure it out" themselves. He also criticized mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for spreading "fake news," highlighting the importance of critical thinking when consuming their content. Trump's stance reflects a concern for the suppression of conservative viewpoints and a belief in the ability of individuals to discern truth from falsehood. END OF SUMMARY.
