SUMMARY: President Trump launched a scathing attack on social media companies, accusing them of blatant censorship and discrimination against conservative voices. He proposed a seemingly paradoxical solution: let everyone participate, regardless of their moral standing, and society will sort it out. Trump's suggestion reveals a pragmatic approach to free speech, acknowledging the challenges of policing censorship. He also criticizes the biased moderation practices of social media giants, highlighting their selective enforcement of rules, which disproportionately silences right-wing voices while allowing those on the left to continue spreading misinformation unchecked. The president's mention of "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC serves as a reminder of the need for critical thinking when consuming media, regardless of political affiliation. The timing of Trump's tirade is noteworthy, as it coincides with the recent banning of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars by several platforms, raising questions about the boundaries of acceptable discourse and the role of private companies in shaping public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
