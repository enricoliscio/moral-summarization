Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about President Trump criticizing social media companies on Twitter. He accuses them of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices, which is one of the moral words I need to include. He mentions that too many voices are being destroyed, another moral term. He suggests letting everyone participate, both good and bad, implying that censorship is dangerous and hard to police.

I should highlight Trump's main points: the discrimination against conservatives, the destruction of voices, and his stance against censorship. I also need to note that he didn't mention specific people but referenced the banning of Alex Jones.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these moral terms and ensure it's concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's criticism, then his accusations, the solution he suggests, and end with the mention of censorship and the reference to Alex Jones.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and includes all necessary moral framing words without being too lengthy. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.
