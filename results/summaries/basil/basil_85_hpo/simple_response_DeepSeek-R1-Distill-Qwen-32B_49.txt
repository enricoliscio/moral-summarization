Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's tweets regarding social media companies. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points Trump made and the implications he's highlighting.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is accusing social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He mentions that too many voices are being silenced, both good and bad, and suggests letting everyone participate. He also criticizes censorship as dangerous and impossible to police, tying it into his usual "fake news" narrative, specifically mentioning CNN and MSNBC.

I should note that he didn't name any specific individuals but referenced recent actions against Alex Jones and Infowars. The moral framing here is about free speech, fairness, and the dangers of censorship. Trump is positioning himself as a defender of free expression against what he sees as biased platforms.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, making sure to include the key accusations, his proposed solution, and the moral arguments he's making. I should also mention the context of recent bans, like Alex Jones, without getting into too much detail.

I should start with Trump's accusation, then his solution, the dangers he points out, and the mention of recent events. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and captures the essence of his argument without adding personal opinions.

Let me draft that. Maybe something like: Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against conservatives, proposed letting everyone participate, criticized censorship, linked it to fake news, and referenced recent bans without naming specific people. That should cover the main points while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the article.
