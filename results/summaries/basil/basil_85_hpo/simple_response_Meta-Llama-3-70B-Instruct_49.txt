SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies, claiming they discriminate against Republican and conservative voices. He argued that censorship is dangerous and impossible to police, and instead suggested that all voices, both good and bad, should be allowed to participate. Trump accused social media giants of closing down opinions on the right while doing nothing to others, and went on to rant about "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC. His comments come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's solution is to allow all voices to be heard, and let people figure it out for themselves. This approach raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential harm it can cause. By advocating for the unregulated spread of all voices, Trump's stance neglects the importance of responsible moderation and the need to protect users from harmful content.
