SUMMARY: In a series of tweets, President Trump accused social media companies of discriminating against Republican and Conservative voices, claiming that they are being destroyed and closed down while nothing is being done about it. He suggested that the solution is to let everybody participate, regardless of their moral standing, and that we will have to figure out how to deal with the situation. Trump's tweets come in the wake of several social media giants banning conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. The president's tirade included familiar accusations of "fake news" against CNN and MSNBC, while also acknowledging that he sometimes watches these networks. Trump's use of morally-charged language such as "discriminating," "destroyed," "closing," "nothing," and "censorship" highlights his belief that the actions of social media companies are unjust and unfair, particularly towards those on the right.
END OF SUMMARY.
