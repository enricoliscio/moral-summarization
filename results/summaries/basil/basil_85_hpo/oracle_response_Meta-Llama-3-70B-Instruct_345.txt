SUMMARY:

President Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing "nothing" to others. He argued that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that it's "impossible to police." Trump's solution is to "let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!" He also lamented that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen." In his rant, Trump also criticized "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them occasionally "with a grain of salt." The tweets come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms.
