SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies, accusing them of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. He claimed that many voices, both good and bad, are being destroyed and that censorship is a dangerous thing that's impossible to police. Trump suggested that the solution is to let everybody participate, regardless of their views, and that people will just have to figure it out. He also took a shot at "fake news" outlets CNN and MSNBC, admitting that he sometimes watches them, but with a grain of salt. Trump's tweets come after several social media companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump did not mention Jones specifically, but his tweets seem to be in response to the recent crackdown on far-right voices on social media.
