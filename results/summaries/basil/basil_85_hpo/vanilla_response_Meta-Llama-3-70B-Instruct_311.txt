SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies, accusing them of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. He claimed that many voices, both good and bad, are being destroyed and that censorship is a dangerous thing that is impossible to police. Trump suggested that the solution is to allow everyone to participate, both good and bad, and let people figure it out for themselves. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC, calling them "fake news" and saying he only watches them with a grain of salt. The tweets come after several social media companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump did not mention any specific individuals in his tweets, but his comments seem to be in response to the recent actions taken by tech companies.

END OF SUMMARY.
