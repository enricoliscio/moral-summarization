SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump took to Twitter to accuse social media companies of "totally discriminating" against Republican and conservative voices, claiming they are "closing down" opinions on the right while doing "nothing" to others. He argued that "censorship is a very dangerous thing" and that it's "impossible to police." Trump's solution is to let "everybody participate, good & bad," and that "we will all just have to figure it out!" He also ranted about "fake news" CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them but "with a grain of salt." Trump's tweets come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's accusations imply that social media companies are "destroying" voices and opinions, and that this kind of censorship is a threat to free speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
