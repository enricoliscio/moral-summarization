Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's tweets on social media discrimination. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, Trump is accusing social media companies of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. He's saying they're closing down opinions on the right while not doing anything about others. He mentions that some voices, both good and bad, are being destroyed and that this can't be allowed. His solution is to let everyone participate and figure it out together.

He also brings up censorship being dangerous and impossible to police, which is a common point in his arguments. He criticizes "fake news" media like CNN and MSNBC, even though he watches them sometimes. The article notes that he didn't name anyone specifically, but recently, social media platforms banned Alex Jones and Infowars, which is relevant.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's main accusations, his solution, mention of censorship, the media criticism, and the recent bans without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's accusation, his solution, mention of censorship, reference to media outlets, and the recent bans. Make sure it's concise and captures all key points without exceeding the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the required length.
