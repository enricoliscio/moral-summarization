Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a news article about President Trump criticizing social media companies for bias against conservatives. They want a summary that keeps the moral words intact.

The user also gave a specific structure: first, list all the morally framed words, each on a new line with an asterisk. Then, write a concise summary using those words. I should make sure not to miss any of the moral terms.

Looking at the article, I need to identify words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "discriminating," "voices," "destroyed," "censorship," "dangerous," "impossible," "police," "fake news," "salt," "banned," and "conspiracy theorist." These words are used to convey judgment or moral implications in the context.

Next, the summary needs to be under 200 words. I should include Trump's main points: accusing social media of discrimination, his solution of letting everyone participate, the dangers of censorship, the mention of fake news, and the recent bans like Infowars. I need to ensure the summary flows naturally while retaining those moral terms.

I should also check if I'm using the right terms and not adding any extra information. Keeping it concise but comprehensive is key. Let me make sure each step is followed correctly and the summary accurately reflects the article's moral framing.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discriminating  
* Voices  
* Destroyed  
* Censorship  
* Dangerous  
* Impossible  
* Police  
* Fake news  
* Salt  
* Banned  
* Conspiracy theorist  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Donald Trump criticized social media companies on Twitter, accusing them of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices." He argued that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and called for everyone, "good & bad," to participate. Trump accused the platforms of "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT" while ignoring others, warning that "censorship is a very dangerous thing & impossible to police." He also reiterated his criticism of "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he watches "just with a grain of salt." While not naming anyone specifically, Trump's comments came after several tech companies recently banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
