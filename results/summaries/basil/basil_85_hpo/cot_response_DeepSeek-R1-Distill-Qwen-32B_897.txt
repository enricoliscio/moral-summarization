Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down.

First, the user provided a news article about President Trump criticizing social media companies on Twitter. He accused them of discriminating against Republicans and conservatives, mentioned censorship, fake news, and referenced media outlets like CNN and MSNBC. The user also wants me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary using those words.

Step 1: Identify morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "discriminating," "destroyed," "censorship," "dangerous," "fake news," "salt," "ban," "conspiracy," "theorist," "banned," "platforms." These words have strong moral implications, indicating bias, harm, control, etc.

Step 2: Write the summary. I need to condense the article into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing. I should mention Trump's accusations, his solution, the mention of censorship, fake news, and the recent bans like Alex Jones. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with his accusations, his proposed solution, the mention of media outlets, and the recent events.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and captures all key points without being too verbose. I'll also check that the morally framed words are included to reflect the original article's tone and message.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discriminating  
* Destroyed  
* Dangerous  
* Censorship  
* Impossible  
* Grain of salt  
* Ban  
* Conspiracy  
* Theorist  
* Banned  
* Platforms  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Donald Trump criticized social media companies on Twitter, accusing them of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices" and "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT." He argued that "too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad," and called for allowing "everybody to participate, good & bad." Trump also criticized "censorship," calling it "a very dangerous thing & impossible to police," and reiterated his complaints about "fake news" media outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he watches "just with a grain of salt." While not naming anyone specifically, his comments came amid recent actions by tech companies banning conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
