SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize social media companies, claiming they discriminate against Republican and conservative voices. He tweeted that too many voices are being destroyed, both good and bad, and that everyone should be allowed to participate. Trump accused social media giants of censoring opinions on the right while doing nothing to others. He also mentioned that censorship is dangerous and impossible to police. In his rant, he also brought up "fake news" CNN and MSNBC, admitting to watching them occasionally. Although he didn't reference anyone specific, his tweets come after several tech companies banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms. Trump's solution is to let everyone participate, both good and bad, and figure it out.

END OF SUMMARY.
