Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's tweets regarding social media companies. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about Trump accusing the social media companies of discriminating against conservatives, and he's suggesting letting everyone participate, both good and bad. He mentions censorship and fake news, specifically calling out CNN and MSNBC.

I should make sure to include his main points: the discrimination claim, his solution of letting everyone participate, the mention of censorship being dangerous, and the reference to fake news. Also, it's important to note that he didn't mention Alex Jones directly, but the context is that companies banned him recently.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Trump's accusation, his solution, mention censorship, fake news, and the omission of Alex Jones. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the moral stance he's taking against censorship and for free speech.

Wait, the user also mentioned being a moral expert. So I should highlight the moral arguments he's making, like the danger of censorship and the importance of allowing all voices. That way, the summary reflects the ethical perspective Trump is presenting.

Let me put it all together, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. Make sure to include all key points without going into too much detail. Okay, I think that's a solid plan for the summary.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump criticized social media companies on Twitter, accusing them of discriminating against Republican and conservative voices. He argued that "too many voices are being destroyed" and proposed allowing "everybody to participate, good & bad," leaving it up to users to discern the truth. Trump criticized the platforms for "closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT" while ignoring others, and he warned that censorship is "a very dangerous thing & impossible to police." He also reiterated his familiar complaints about "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he admitted watching but with skepticism. Notably, Trump did not name any specific individuals, though recent bans of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars from major platforms could be implied. His comments reflect a broader moral argument against censorship and in favor of unfettered free expression. END OF SUMMARY.
