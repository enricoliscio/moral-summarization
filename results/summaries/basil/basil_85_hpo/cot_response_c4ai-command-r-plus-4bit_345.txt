* Discrimination
* Bad
* Dangerous
* Fake

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized social media companies for their alleged discrimination against Republican and conservative voices, claiming that they are being censored and that it is dangerous and impossible to police. He suggested that everyone, regardless of their views, should be allowed to participate and that people will "figure it out." Trump also accused the companies of bias, asserting that they target right-leaning individuals while ignoring those on the left. He mentioned no names but seemed to allude to the recent bans of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars by several platforms. The president also took a familiar swipe at "fake news" outlets like CNN and MSNBC, which he watches, he said, with "a grain of salt." Trump's stance on free speech appears to prioritize participation over potential consequences, urging platforms to let "good and bad" voices be heard. END OF SUMMARY.
