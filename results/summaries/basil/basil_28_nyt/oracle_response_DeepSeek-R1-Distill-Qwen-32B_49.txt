Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used the words "injured" and "killed," so I should make sure those are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. Biden used aggressive tactics, mocked Ryan, and referenced Kennedy and Quayle. The moderator was more active than before. The key moral elements are the personal tragedies mentioned, like Biden's family being killed in a car crash.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Biden's aggressive debating style, the mention of Kennedy, the moderator's approach, and the personal stories that added emotional weight. I'll make sure to include "injured" and "killed" as per the user's request.

Let me structure it: start with the debate context, describe Biden's tactics, mention Ryan's attempts, the moderator's role, and end with the personal tragedy. Keep it concise and ensure the moral framing is clear.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary natural. Also, remember to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without quotes.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to hit all these points and stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY: In the 2012 vice presidential debate, Joe Biden aggressively confronted Paul Ryan, using tactics reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate style. Biden mocked Ryan, comparing him to Dan Quayle and questioning his invocation of John F. Kennedy. Biden's interruptions and patronizing demeanor dominated the debate, with Ryan occasionally showing irritation. Biden highlighted Ryan's contradictions, such as advocating for stimulus funds while criticizing the program. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, actively pushed for specifics, unlike the previous debate. Ryan praised Mitt Romney, recounting a story about Romney helping a couple whose children were injured in a car accident. Biden responded by sharing his own tragedy, when his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. The debate was intense, with Biden's aggressive style overshadowing Ryan's attempts to maintain decorum. END OF SUMMARY.
