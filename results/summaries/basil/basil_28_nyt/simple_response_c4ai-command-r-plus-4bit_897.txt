SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden channeled his inner Lloyd Bentsen, scoffing at Paul Ryan and painting him as a latter-day Dan Quayle. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and unleashing his inner barroom brawler. He mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his district and criticized Romney's "47 percent" remark. Ryan tried to be respectful but showed irritation at Biden's interruptions. Biden's performance was a sharp contrast to his debate with Sarah Palin four years ago, where he had to be cautious. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, was forceful and pushed the candidates to be specific. Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image by recounting a personal story. Biden countered by sharing his own tragedy. The debate was a spirited affair with both candidates delivering lacerating blows, but Biden's theatrics and retorts dominated the night.
END OF SUMMARY.
