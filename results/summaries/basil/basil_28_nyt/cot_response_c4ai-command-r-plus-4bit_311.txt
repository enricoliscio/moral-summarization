SUMMARY:
Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Paul D. Ryan faced off in a sharp and spirited vice presidential debate, with Biden taking a page from Lloyd Bentsen's playbook and unleashing his inner *barroom* brawler. Biden scoffed at and interrupted Ryan, dismissing his arguments as *malarkey* with *belly* laughs and *patronizing* grins. He relished his role as the president's defender, coming to Barack Obama's rescue after the latter's dismal performance in the first presidential debate. Ryan, meanwhile, seemed disconcerted by Biden's *blowhard* intensity and showed *duress* when Biden attacked his policy on Medicare. Biden mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his district, and took aim at Mitt Romney's infamous "47 percent" remark. Ryan attempted to praise Romney and soften his image by recounting a charitable act, but this backfired as Biden shared his own personal tragedy involving a car crash. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful and pushed for specifics, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Biden's performance was a clear attempt to rectify his own past mistakes, and he showed no restraint in taking on his younger opponent. The debate was marked by *withering* retorts and intense exchanges, with Biden's *bully*-like behavior standing in contrast to the *courtly* demeanor of Bentsen in 1988.
