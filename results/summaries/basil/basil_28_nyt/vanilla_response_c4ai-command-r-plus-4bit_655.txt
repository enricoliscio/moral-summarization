SUMMARY: Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Paul Ryan faced off in a sharp and spirited vice presidential debate moderated by Martha Raddatz. Biden channeled his inner Lloyd Bentsen, scoffing at and interrupting Ryan, unleashing his inner barroom brawler. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and mocking him for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking funds for his district. Ryan tried to be respectful but showed irritation at Biden's interruptions. Biden also brought up Romney's "47 percent" remark, while Ryan reminded Biden of his own gaffes. Biden relived past debates and let loose, singeing Ryan with patronizing grins and withering retorts. Ryan held his own but looked abashed at times. Raddatz was forceful and pushed for specificity, a contrast to Jim Lehrer's moderation in the first presidential debate. Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image with a personal anecdote. Biden shared his own tragedy, the loss of his wife and daughter in a car crash. The debate was a reboot for the Obama campaign after Obama's lackluster performance in the first debate. Biden's performance was a contrast to his more reserved demeanor in his debate with Sarah Palin in 2008.
END OF SUMMARY.
