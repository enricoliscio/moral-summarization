Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, okay. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and the tone.

The article describes Biden's aggressive debating style, comparing it to Lloyd Bentsen's from 1988. Biden uses humor and interruptions to undermine Ryan. He mocks Ryan's references to JFK and points out contradictions in Ryan's policies, especially regarding the stimulus. Ryan tries to stay respectful but gets flustered. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, is more active than previous moderators, pushing for specifics.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The author seems critical of Biden's approach, implying it's more about personal attacks than substance. There's a contrast between Biden's aggressive tactics and Ryan's attempts at decorum. Also, the moderator's role in keeping the debate focused is noted.

So, the summary should mention Biden's tactics, the personal jabs, the policy contradictions, Ryan's respectful yet flustered response, and the moderator's active role. It should reflect the moral judgment on Biden's approach being underhanded or lacking substance.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. Let me structure it: start with the debate context, describe Biden's methods, mention Ryan's reactions, and note the moderator's role. Conclude with the moral framing about the debate's nature.

Wait, I should ensure the summary doesn't just list events but captures the author's critique of Biden's debating style as being more about personal jabs than policy depth. That's the moral framing hereâ€”criticizing Biden for not engaging substantively.

Okay, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it together, making sure it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

Biden mocked Ryan's references to John F. Kennedy and highlighted contradictions in Ryan's policies, particularly regarding Medicare and the stimulus. Ryan, while respectful, appeared flustered by Biden's relentless attacks and struggled to maintain his composure. The debate, moderated by Martha Raddatz, saw Biden dominating the stage, contrasting with his more restrained performance in the 2008 debate against Sarah Palin. The article highlights Biden's tactical use of humor and sarcasm, suggesting a departure from substantive policy discussion in favor of personal and political jabs. END OF SUMMARY.
