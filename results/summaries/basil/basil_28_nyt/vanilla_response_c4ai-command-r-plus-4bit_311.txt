SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed sharply and spiritedly, with Biden taking a particularly aggressive and interruptive approach. Biden invoked Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate playbook, scoffing at and patronizing Ryan while unleashing his inner barroom brawler. He relished his role as President Obama's defender after the latter's dismal performance in the first presidential debate. Biden mocked Ryan's support for tax cuts and opposition to the Obama stimulus, while Ryan attempted to paint Biden as gaffe-prone. Moderator Martha Raddatz was forceful and pushed for specifics, a contrast to the passive Jim Lehrer in the first debate. Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image, but Biden countered with a personal tragedy. Biden's performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign, though Ryan held his own.
END OF SUMMARY.
