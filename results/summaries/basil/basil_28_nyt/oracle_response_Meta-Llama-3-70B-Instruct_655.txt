SUMMARY:

In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, employing a playbook reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate strategy. Biden's sharp and spirited delivery left Paul Ryan disconcerted, as he unleashed his inner barroom brawler, singeing Ryan with patronizing grins and withering retorts. Ryan tried to be respectful, but showed irritation when Biden interrupted to attack his policy on Medicare. The debate was marked by lacerating blows from both sides, with Biden landing several, including a blow to Ryan's credibility on the Obama stimulus. When Ryan brought up Biden's propensity for gaffes, Biden was not amused. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was determined to be more forceful than her predecessor, pushing the candidates to be specific. The debate was a night of withering ripostes, mostly delivered by Biden, who shared his own personal tragedy of losing his wife and young daughter in a car crash, in response to Ryan's attempt to soften Romney's image. 

END OF SUMMARY.
