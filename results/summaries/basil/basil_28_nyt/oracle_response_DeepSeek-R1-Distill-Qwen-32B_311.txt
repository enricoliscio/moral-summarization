Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing, specifically using the words "injured" and "killed." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Biden used a confrontational style, mocked Ryan, and referenced Kennedy. Ryan tried to stay respectful but got interrupted a lot. The debate was intense, with Biden being more aggressive. 

I need to include the moral terms. The article mentions Biden's personal tragedy, where his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. That's a clear use of "killed." Also, when Ryan talked about Romney helping a couple whose children were injured, that's "injured." 

I should structure the summary to highlight the debate's intensity, Biden's aggressive tactics, and the emotional elements involving these moral terms. I'll make sure to mention how Biden brought up his personal loss and how Ryan's example backfired by bringing up the tragedy. 

I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. I'll start by introducing the debate's context, then describe Biden's approach, include the specific instances with "injured" and "killed," and conclude with the overall impact of the debate.

SUMMARY:  
The 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was marked by Biden's aggressive and confrontational style, as he sought to redeem the Obama campaign after President Obama's poor performance in the previous debate. Biden mocked Ryan, dismissing his arguments as "malarkey" and interrupting him frequently, at times resembling a "barroom brawler" rather than a statesman. Ryan, attempting to maintain decorum, occasionally showed irritation, particularly when Biden mocked his stance on Medicare and the stimulus program. Biden, relishing the opportunity to counter Ryan, even referenced Ryan's opposition to the stimulus while seeking funds for his district, calling it a "bad program." The debate also took a personal turn when Ryan praised Mitt Romney for helping a couple whose children were injured in a car accident, prompting Biden to recount his own tragic loss when his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. The intensity of the debate highlighted Biden's determination to correct the campaign's earlier missteps, with both candidates delivering sharp ripostes but Biden dominating the tone. END OF SUMMARY.
