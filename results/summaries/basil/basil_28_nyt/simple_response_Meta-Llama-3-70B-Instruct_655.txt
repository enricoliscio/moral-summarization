SUMMARY:

The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was a spirited and sharp exchange, with Biden coming out on top. Biden, clearly delighted to rescue President Obama's campaign after his dismal performance last week, relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Biden's sharp wit and patronizing grins left Ryan disconcerted at times, and he struggled to keep up with Biden's relentless interruptive barrage. While Ryan held his own, Biden's withering retorts and mocking tone left him looking abashed. The debate moderator, Martha Raddatz, also played a key role, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. Overall, Biden's performance was a marked improvement over Obama's, and he successfully painted Ryan as inexperienced and inconsistent.

END OF SUMMARY.
