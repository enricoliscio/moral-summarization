Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the author used the words "injured" and "killed," so I should include those. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. Biden was aggressive, using tactics from past debates, and the article describes the exchange as heated with personal attacks.

I need to highlight the moral elements. The article mentions Biden bringing up Ryan's request for stimulus funds, implying hypocrisy, and Ryan bringing up Biden's gaffe about the 47%. Also, the moderator, Martha Raddatz, is noted for being more forceful than her predecessor.

The key moral points are Biden's aggressive tactics, the personal attacks, and the mention of Biden's personal tragedy involving his family being killed in a car crash. I should make sure to include "killed" there.

I'll structure the summary to include these elements, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I'll start by introducing the debate, then mention Biden's tactics, the personal attacks, and the moderator's role. Finally, I'll touch on the personal tragedy to highlight the moral framing.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral terms without being too verbose. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
The 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks. Biden, seeking to redeem the Obama campaign after President Obama's poor performance in the prior debate, adopted a confrontational style, drawing comparisons to Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate tactics. He mocked Ryan, dismissing his arguments as "malarkey" and interrupting him repeatedly. A key moment came when Biden criticized Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his district, a move Biden derided as hypocritical. Ryan, in turn, highlighted Biden's own gaffe about the "47 percent," though Biden seemed unamused. The debate also saw Biden bring up his personal tragedy, recalling how his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash, a moment that underscored the emotional stakes. Moderator Martha Raddatz pushed for specificity, avoiding the passivity of the prior debate. Overall, the debate was a clash of styles, with Biden's aggressive tactics dominating the proceedings. END OF SUMMARY.
