SUMMARY:

In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden employed a playbook reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate, shaking his head and scoffing at Paul Ryan. Biden's sharp and spirited performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after President Obama's dismal performance in the previous debate. Biden's relentless interruptive barrage and withering retorts left Ryan disconcerted, despite his respectful demeanor. The debate saw both candidates deliver lacerating blows, with Biden mocking Ryan's policy on Medicare and his request for government funds despite opposing the Obama stimulus. Ryan reminded Biden of his own propensity for gaffes, but Biden was unfazed. The debate moderator, Martha Raddatz, was determined to be more forceful than her predecessor, pushing the candidates to be specific. The night was marked by Biden's inner barroom brawler unleashed, with Ryan looking abashed at times. The debate also saw a poignant moment when Biden described his own tragedy, the death of his wife and young daughter in a car crash, in response to Ryan's attempt to soften Romney's image.

END OF SUMMARY.
