SUMMARY:
In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, relishing his role and delivering withering ripostes to Representative Paul D. Ryan. Biden's sharp and spirited performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president's dismal showing in his debate with Mitt Romney. Biden's debate style was marked by patronizing grins, relentless interrupting, and withering retorts, leaving Ryan disconcerted and abashed at times. Ryan tried to be respectful, but showed irritation when Biden attacked his policy on Medicare. The debate was a night of sharp exchanges, with both candidates landing lacerating blows. Biden's performance was a marked departure from his more courteous demeanor in his debate with Sarah Palin four years ago. END OF SUMMARY.
