SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden dominated the vice presidential debate against Representative Paul D. Ryan, using his experience and wit to attack Ryan's arguments. Biden's performance was a stark contrast to President Obama's lackluster debate last week. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, laughing and scoffing at his opponent's remarks. Ryan, trying to be respectful, seemed disconcerted by Biden's intensity. The debate was sharp and spirited, with both candidates delivering blows, but Biden's relentless attacks and patronizing grins left Ryan looking abashed. Moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News also played a key role, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. The debate was a reboot for the Obama campaign, with Biden coming to the president's rescue.

END OF SUMMARY.
