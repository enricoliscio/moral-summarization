SUMMARY:

In the 2012 vice presidential debate, Joe Biden employed a playbook reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate strategy, scoffing and shaking his head at Paul Ryan's arguments. Biden's aggressive approach, replete with patronizing grins and withering retorts, left Ryan disconcerted and occasionally abashed. The vice president's relentless interruptive barrage and mugging for the camera were a far cry from his more contained demeanor in his 2008 debate against Sarah Palin. While Ryan held his own, Biden's sharp ripostes, particularly on Medicare and the stimulus, left him on the defensive. Moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News also played a key role, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. Ultimately, the debate was a spirited and sharp exchange, with Biden emerging as the more dominant figure.

END OF SUMMARY.
