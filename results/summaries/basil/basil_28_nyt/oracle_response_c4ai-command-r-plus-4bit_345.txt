SUMMARY: The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was a spirited affair, with Biden taking a page out of Lloyd Bentsen's playbook and unleashing his inner barroom brawler. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and interrupting him frequently to attack his policies. He mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his district, and brought up Romney's "47 percent" comment. Ryan tried to be respectful but showed irritation at Biden's interruptions, and attempted to soften Romney's image by recounting a story of his generosity. Biden, however, had the upper hand when he described his own tragedy involving a car crash that killed his wife and daughter, which was more impactful than Ryan's story of injured children. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful and pushed the candidates to be specific, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Biden's performance was a sharp contrast to his more reserved demeanor in the 2008 debate with Sarah Palin, and he seemed determined to relive past debates and let loose.
END OF SUMMARY.
