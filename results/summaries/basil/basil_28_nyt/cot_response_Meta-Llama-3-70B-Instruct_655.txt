SUMMARY:
In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, using his old friend Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook to shake his head and scoff pityingly at Paul Ryan. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and laughing heartily at his remarks. Ryan seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity, trying to be respectful but showing irritation when interrupted. Biden unleashed his inner barroom brawler, turning up the temperature with patronizing grins and withering retorts. Ryan held his own, but looked abashed when mocked for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds. The debate was sharp and spirited, with both candidates delivering lacerating blows. END OF SUMMARY.
