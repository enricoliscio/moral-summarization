SUMMARY: Joe Biden's performance in the vice presidential debate with Paul Ryan was a sharp contrast to his more reserved demeanor in the 2008 debate with Sarah Palin. Biden relished the role of the aggressor, unleashing a barrage of mocking retorts and scoffs at Ryan's arguments. His relentless interruptive style left Ryan disconcerted at times, but Biden's approach carried the risk of coming across as graceless bullying. Biden mocked Ryan for his opposition to the Obama stimulus while requesting funds for his district, and he took aim at Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment. Ryan, for his part, attempted to paint Biden as prone to gaffes and referenced Biden's own tragic car accident to counter a story about Romney's generosity. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, sought to rectify the passive approach of the previous debate moderator, Jim Lehrer, by speaking forcefully and pushing for specificity. Biden's performance achieved its purpose of rebooting the Obama campaign after the president's dismal showing in the first presidential debate. END OF SUMMARY.
