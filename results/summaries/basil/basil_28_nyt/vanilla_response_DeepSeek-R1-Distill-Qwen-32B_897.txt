Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article describes the debate where Biden used aggressive tactics, referencing past debates, especially Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate. He mocked Ryan, comparing him to Dan Quayle and questioning his references to John F. Kennedy. Biden seemed to enjoy the debate, interrupting often and using humor, which sometimes made him look more like a comedian than a candidate. Ryan tried to stay respectful but showed irritation, especially when Biden interrupted about Medicare. There were specific moments where Biden criticized Ryan's stance on the stimulus and Medicare, and Ryan tried to counter by mentioning Biden's past gaffes. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was more assertive than previous moderators.

I need to condense this into a summary that highlights Biden's aggressive style, key moments, and the contrast between the candidates. I should mention the comparison to Bentsen, the use of humor, Ryan's respectful but occasionally irritated demeanor, and the moderator's approach. Also, note the emotional moment when Biden brought up his personal tragedy in response to Ryan's story about Romney.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Biden's approach, then key points of contention, Ryan's responses, and the moderator's role. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful moments without getting bogged down in details.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements concisely. I'll start with Biden's aggressive tactics, mention the comparisons and humor, describe Ryan's reactions, and touch on the moderator and emotional moment. Then I'll wrap it up with the outcome, emphasizing Biden's dominance.
