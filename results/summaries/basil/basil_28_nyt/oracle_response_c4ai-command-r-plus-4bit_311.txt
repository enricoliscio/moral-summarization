SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed sharply and spiritedly, with Biden taking a page out of Lloyd Bentsen's playbook and unleashing his inner barroom brawler. Biden mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking funds for his district and took aim at Romney's "47 percent" remark. Ryan, trying to be respectful, showed irritation at Biden's interruptions and patronizing grins. Biden relished his role, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and laughing heartily at his remarks. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, was forceful and pushed for specificity. Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image by recounting a story of Romney's charitable actions toward a couple whose children were injured in a car accident. Biden, however, brought up his own tragedy, where his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. The debate was a chance for Biden to relive past debates and aggressively challenge his opponent.
END OF SUMMARY.
