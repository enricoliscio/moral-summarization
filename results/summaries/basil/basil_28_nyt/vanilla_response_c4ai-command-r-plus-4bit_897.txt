SUMMARY: During the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed sharply, with Biden taking a particularly aggressive and mocking tone. Biden scoffed at Ryan and frequently interrupted him, relishing his role as President Obama's defender after Obama's poor performance in the first presidential debate. Biden's performance was a contrast to his more reserved demeanor in the 2008 debate against Sarah Palin. Ryan held his own but at times seemed disconcerted by Biden's intensity and patronizing grins. The debate moderator, Martha Raddatz, was also more forceful and engaged than the previous moderator, Jim Lehrer. Biden used the debate to rectify his predecessor's mistakes and unleash his inner barroom brawler, while Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image. Biden mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his district and brought up Romney's "47 percent" remark. Ryan reminded Biden of his own gaffes, and Biden shared a personal tragedy to counter Ryan's praise of Romney's charitable actions. The vice presidential debate was expected to boost the Obama campaign after Obama's underwhelming performance in the first presidential debate.
END OF SUMMARY.
