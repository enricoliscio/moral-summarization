SUMMARY: Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Paul D. Ryan faced off in a sharp and spirited vice presidential debate, with Biden taking an aggressive and mocking approach, seeking to rectify President Obama's passive performance in the previous debate. Biden scoffed at Ryan, interrupting him frequently and dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He relished his role as the attacker, unleashing his inner barroom brawler and singeing Ryan with patronizing grins and withering retorts. Ryan held his own but at times seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity. Biden particularly went after Romney's "47 percent" remark, while Ryan reminded Biden of his own gaffes. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful and assertive, a stark contrast to the previous moderator, Jim Lehrer. Biden's performance was a clear attempt to reboot the Obama campaign and rescue the president after his dismal showing in the first debate. He relished playing the attacker, a role he was unable to assume in his debate with Sarah Palin four years prior. Biden's aggressive and mocking demeanor towards Ryan drew comparisons to Lloyd Bentsen's debate performance in 1988.
END OF SUMMARY.
