SUMMARY: 

The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was a sharp and spirited exchange, with both candidates delivering strong blows. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama's rescue after his dismal performance last week, relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" but dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Biden laughed at Ryan's remarks, often and heartily, and unleashed his inner barroom brawler. Ryan, trying to be respectful, showed irritation when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. The debate was marked by Biden's patronizing grins, withering retorts, and relentless interruptive barrage. Ryan held his own, but looked abashed when Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus yet asking for government funds for his own district. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful in pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly.
