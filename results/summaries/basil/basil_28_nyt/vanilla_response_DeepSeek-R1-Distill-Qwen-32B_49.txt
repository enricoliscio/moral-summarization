SUMMARY:  
The 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was marked by Biden's aggressive and humorous style, as he sought to redeem the Obama campaign after President Obama's poor performance in the previous debate. Biden, referencing Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate tactics, mocked Ryan, comparing him to Dan Quayle and questioning his economic policies. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, dismissing his arguments as "malarkey" and using humor to undermine his opponent. Ryan, though respectful, appeared flustered by Biden's intensity and interruptions, particularly over Medicare and stimulus funding. Biden also mocked Ryan for opposing the stimulus while seeking funds for his district. The debate was lively, with both candidates exchanging sharp remarks, though Biden dominated with his wit and interruptions. Moderator Martha Raddatz actively pushed for specifics, avoiding the passive approach of the previous debate. The debate also touched on emotional topics, with Biden recounting his family tragedy after Ryan praised Romney's kindness. Overall, Biden's performance stood out as a spirited and memorable display of debate tactics.
