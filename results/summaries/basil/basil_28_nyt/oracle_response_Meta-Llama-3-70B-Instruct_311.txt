SUMMARY:

In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, relishing his role and delivering sharp, spirited, and often withering retorts to Representative Paul D. Ryan. Biden's performance was reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate playbook, as he scoffed and laughed at Ryan's remarks, painting him as a latter-day Dan Quayle. Ryan, however, held his own, despite looking disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity. The debate was marked by lacerating blows, with Biden unleashing his inner barroom brawler and Ryan showing irritation at being interrupted. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was determined to keep the debate on track, pushing the candidates to be specific. In a poignant moment, Ryan's attempt to soften Romney's image was met with Biden's personal tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash. Overall, the debate was a night of withering ripostes, mostly delivered by Biden.
