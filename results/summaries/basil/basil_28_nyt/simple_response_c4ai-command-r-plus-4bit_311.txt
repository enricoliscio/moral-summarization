SUMMARY: Joe Biden's vice presidential debate performance was a sharp contrast to his counterpart, Sarah Palin, in 2008, when he had to hold back to avoid appearing as a bully. This time, Biden let loose, mocking and interrupting Ryan with a barroom brawler-like intensity. Biden's performance was a clear attempt to make up for President Obama's lackluster debate against Mitt Romney the week before. He relished his role, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and unleashing a barrage of withering retorts. While Ryan held his own, he seemed disconcerted by Biden's aggressive approach and at times appeared abashed by the vice president's patronizing grins and retorts. Biden's performance was a strategic move to rectify the mistakes of his predecessor, Lloyd Bentsen, who was too courtly in his 1988 debate. Biden's inner brawler was on full display, and he made sure to let loose, consequences be damned.

END OF SUMMARY.
