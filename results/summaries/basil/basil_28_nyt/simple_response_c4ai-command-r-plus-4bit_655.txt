SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came out swinging, channeling his inner Lloyd Bentsen and taking a patronizing, mocking tone with his opponent, Paul Ryan. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and unleashing his inner barroom brawler. He interrupted Ryan frequently and mugged silently for the camera, singeing Ryan with withering retorts. Ryan held his own but seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity and interruptive barrage. Biden particularly went after Romney's "47 percent" remark, while Ryan reminded Biden of his own gaffes. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, was forceful and pushed the candidates to be specific, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Ryan praised Romney and tried to humanize him, but Biden countered by sharing his own personal tragedy. Biden's performance was a sharp contrast to his more reserved demeanor in the 2008 debate with Sarah Palin. Overall, the debate was sharp and spirited, with Biden delivering the most memorable moments.
END OF SUMMARY.
