SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed in a sharp and spirited exchange, with Biden taking a page out of Lloyd Bentsen's playbook and unleashing his inner barroom brawler. Biden scoffed at Ryan, mocked him, and interrupted him relentlessly, singeing him with withering retorts and patronizing grins. Ryan held his own but seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, addressing Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He laughed heartily at Ryan's remarks, at times resembling a guest at a comedy club roast rather than a serious debate. Biden took the opportunity to relive past debates and let loose, unlike his more reserved performance with Sarah Palin four years prior. He particularly targeted Ryan's opposition to the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his own district. Biden also brought up Romney's "47 percent" comment, while Ryan countered by reminding Biden of his own gaffes. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, was forceful and pushed the candidates to be specific, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Ryan praised Romney and tried to humanize him by recounting a story of his generosity, but this prompted Biden to share his own tragedy of losing his wife and daughter in a car crash. The debate ended with Biden delivering most of the withering ripostes.
END OF SUMMARY.
