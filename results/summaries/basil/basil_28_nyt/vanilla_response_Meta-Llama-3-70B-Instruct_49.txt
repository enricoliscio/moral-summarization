SUMMARY:

The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was a sharp and spirited exchange, with both candidates delivering strong arguments. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama's rescue after his dismal performance last week, relished his role and addressed Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Biden's performance was reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing at Ryan. Ryan, trying to be respectful, showed irritation at times, particularly when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. The debate was marked by Biden's patronizing grins, withering retorts, and relentless interruptive barrage. Ryan held his own, but looked abashed when Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his own district. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful in pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly.

END OF SUMMARY.
