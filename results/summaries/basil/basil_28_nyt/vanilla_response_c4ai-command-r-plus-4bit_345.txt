SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed sharply and spiritedly, with Biden taking a more aggressive and interruptive approach, often scoffing and laughing at Ryan's remarks. Biden aimed to rectify President Obama's passive performance in the previous debate, unleashing his inner barroom brawler and mocking Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking funds for his district. Ryan tried to be respectful but showed irritation at Biden's interruptions, reminding Biden of his own gaffes. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, was forceful and pushed for specificity. Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image by recounting a story of Romney's charitable actions. Biden brought up his own personal tragedy in response, emphasizing the importance of the issues at stake. The debate saw Biden delivering withering retorts and relishing his role as Obama's defender.
END OF SUMMARY.
