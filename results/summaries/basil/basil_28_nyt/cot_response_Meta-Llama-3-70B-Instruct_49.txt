SUMMARY:
In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden employed his old friend Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook to shake his head and scoff pityingly at Paul Ryan, painting him as a latter-day Dan Quayle. Biden relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He laughed heartily, seeming like a guest at a comedy club roast, and delivered withering retorts. Ryan tried to be respectful, but showed irritation when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. Biden's interruptive barrage was relentless, and he mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his own district. The debate was sharp and spirited, with both candidates delivering lacerating blows. Biden's performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president's dismal performance last week. END OF SUMMARY.
