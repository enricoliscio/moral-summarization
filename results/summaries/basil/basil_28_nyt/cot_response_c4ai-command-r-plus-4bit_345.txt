SUMMARY:
Vice President Joe Biden's performance in the vice presidential debate was a sharp contrast to his opponent, Representative Paul Ryan. Biden, channeling his inner Lloyd Bentsen, scoffed at and mocked Ryan, dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He relished his role, interrupting Ryan frequently and unleashing his inner barroom brawler, a side he had to contain in his debate with Sarah Palin four years prior. Biden's performance was singeing and patronizing, grinning and shaking his head at Ryan's remarks. Ryan held his own but at times seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity. Biden's goal was clear: to rectify his predecessor's mistakes and rescue President Obama's campaign after the president's dismal performance in the first presidential debate. Biden took every chance to mock Ryan, such as when he brought up Ryan's opposition to the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his district. Biden also took aim at Romney's "47 percent" remark, and Ryan responded by acknowledging Biden's own propensity for gaffes. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful and specific in her questioning, a contrast to the passive Jim Lehrer in the first presidential debate. Ryan praised Romney and tried to soften his image, but Biden countered by sharing his own personal tragedy. Overall, the debate was a night of withering ripostes, mostly delivered by Biden.
