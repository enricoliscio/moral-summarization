SUMMARY: In the 2012 vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan engaged in a sharp and spirited debate, with Biden taking a more aggressive and mocking tone while Ryan remained respectful but showed irritation at Biden's interruptions. Biden relished his role as Obama's defender and used his experience to unleash a barrage of withering retorts and patronizing grins. He scoffed at Ryan's arguments and mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus while requesting government funds for his district. Ryan tried to paint Biden as gaffe-prone and brought up Romney's charitable acts, prompting Biden to share his personal tragedy. Moderator Martha Raddatz was forceful and pushed for specificity. Biden's performance was a contrast to his more reserved demeanor in his 2008 debate with Sarah Palin and was reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate playbook. The debate was seen as a reboot for the Obama campaign after Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate against Romney.
END OF SUMMARY.
