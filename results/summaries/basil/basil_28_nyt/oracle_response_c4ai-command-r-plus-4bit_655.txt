SUMMARY: Joe Biden channeled his inner Lloyd Bentsen in the vice presidential debate against Paul Ryan, mocking and scoffing at his opponent with a barroom brawler attitude. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, interrupting Ryan frequently and dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Ryan tried to maintain a respectful demeanor but showed irritation at Biden's interruptions and patronizing grins. Biden unleashed his inner brawler, singeing Ryan with withering retorts and mocking him for his opposition to the Obama stimulus while requesting funds for his own district. Biden also brought up Romney's "47 percent" remark, while Ryan countered by reminding Biden of his own gaffes. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, was forceful and pushed the candidates to be specific, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Biden's performance was a sharp contrast to his debate with Sarah Palin four years prior, where he had to hold back to avoid appearing bullying. The debate was a spirited affair, with both candidates delivering blows, but Biden's sharp tongue and relentless interruptions seemed to throw Ryan off-balance at times.
END OF SUMMARY.
