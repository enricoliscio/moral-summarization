Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used words like "injured" and "killed," so I should make sure those are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. Biden used aggressive tactics, mocked Ryan, and referenced historical figures like Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle. There was a moment where Biden mentioned John F. Kennedy, which Ryan tried to use against him but Biden turned it into a joke. 

I should note the key moral elements. The article mentions Biden bringing up his own tragedy of his wife and daughter being killed in a car crash. That's a strong moral point, so I need to include that. Also, when Ryan talked about Romney helping a couple whose children were injured, that's another moral framing point. 

I'll structure the summary to highlight Biden's aggressive debating style, his use of humor and mockery, and the emotional moments involving personal tragedies. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure to include the words "injured" and "killed." 

I'll start by introducing the debate and Biden's approach, then mention the JFK reference and the emotional points. I'll also touch on Ryan's attempts to counter and the moderator's role. Finally, I'll wrap it up by emphasizing Biden's dominance and the emotional undertones. 

Let me make sure I'm not adding any extra information and that the summary flows naturally while preserving the moral elements. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise. 

Alright, I think I've got a good summary that meets all the requirements.

SUMMARY:  
The 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was marked by Biden’s aggressive and mocking style, as he sought to redeem the Obama campaign after President Obama’s poor performance in the previous debate. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, dismissing his arguments as “malarkey” and using humor and patronizing grins to undermine his opponent. A key moment came when Ryan mentioned John F. Kennedy in an economic argument, prompting Biden to mockingly ask, “Now you’re Jack Kennedy?” Biden also mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking funds for his district, calling it a “bad program.”  

Ryan, though respectful, appeared disconcerted by Biden’s intensity, especially when Biden referenced his personal tragedy of his wife and daughter being killed in a car crash. Ryan’s attempt to soften Romney’s image by recounting his help for a couple with injured children backfired, as Biden used it to highlight his own grief. The debate was sharp and spirited, with Biden dominating, but both candidates delivered biting remarks. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, actively pushed for specifics, avoiding the passivity of the earlier debate. Biden’s relentless style, reminiscent of Lloyd Bentsen’s 1988 debate tactics, left Ryan on the defensive, though Ryan occasionally pushed back, noting Biden’s own gaffes. The night was a mix of wit, witlessness, and emotional undertones, with Biden’s dominance overshadowing Ryan’s efforts.  
END OF SUMMARY.
