SUMMARY:

The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was a sharp and spirited exchange, with both candidates delivering lacerating blows. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama's rescue after his dismal performance last week, relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" but dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Biden's interruptive barrage was relentless, and he often laughed at Ryan's remarks, making him seem like a guest at a comedy club roast. Ryan, trying to be respectful, showed irritation at times, especially when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. The debate was a chance for Biden to unleash his inner barroom brawler, and he took it, singeing Ryan with patronizing grins and withering retorts. Despite Ryan holding his own, Biden's performance was seen as a reboot for the Obama campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
