SUMMARY: 
Vice President Joe Biden used his debate playbook from his Senate colleague Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 debate to attack Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to portray him as inexperienced and mistaken. Biden frequently laughed and scoffed at Ryan's remarks, addressing him as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Ryan, on the other hand, tried to be respectful but showed irritation when Biden interrupted him. The debate was sharp and spirited, with both candidates delivering blows, but Biden's intensity and patronizing tone left Ryan disconcerted. Biden particularly targeted Ryan's policy on Medicare and his request for government funds despite opposing the Obama stimulus. Ryan reminded Biden of his own gaffes, but Biden was not amused. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was more forceful than the previous debate's moderator, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly.
END OF SUMMARY.
