SUMMARY:

The article describes the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. Biden, determined to rescue President Obama's campaign after his dismal performance in the previous debate, took a sharp and spirited approach, often laughing and scoffing at Ryan's remarks. He repeatedly interrupted Ryan, attacking his policy on Medicare and mocking him for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his own district. Ryan, trying to be respectful, seemed disconcerted by Biden's intensity. The debate was marked by withering retorts and patronizing grins from Biden, who relished his role in attacking Ryan's arguments. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was more forceful than her predecessor, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. Overall, the debate was a night of sharp exchanges, with Biden delivering most of the blows.
