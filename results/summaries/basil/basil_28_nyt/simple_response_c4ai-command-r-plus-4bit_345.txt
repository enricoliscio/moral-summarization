SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed sharply and spiritedly, with Biden taking a page out of Lloyd Bentsen's playbook by scoffing at and interrupting Ryan, unleashing his inner barroom brawler. Biden relished his role as President Obama's defender, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and mocking him for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking funds for his district. Biden also took aim at Romney's "47 percent" remark, while Ryan reminded Biden of his own gaffes. Ryan held his own but seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity and patronizing grins. Moderator Martha Raddatz was forceful and pushed for specificity, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Biden's performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after Obama's dismal showing in the first debate. Biden's interruptions and mugging for the camera stood out, along with his effective use of his own tragedy to counter Ryan's praise of Romney's charitable acts. The debate showcased Biden's aggressive style and provided a contrast to the more subdued presidential debate.
END OF SUMMARY.
