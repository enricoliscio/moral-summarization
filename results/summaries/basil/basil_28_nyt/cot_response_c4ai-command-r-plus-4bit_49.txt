SUMMARY: Joe Biden knew how to play the game and used his old Senate colleague's playbook to his advantage during the vice presidential debate with Representative Paul Ryan. Biden relished his role, reliving past debates and unleashing his inner barroom brawler. He patronized and singed Ryan with relentless interruptions and a barrage of withering retorts. Biden's mugging for the camera and interruptive barrage were relentless, and his mockery of Ryan at times left the young congressman abashed. Biden's performance was courteous, but he let loose with a blowhard intensity that was absent from his debate with Sarah Palin four years ago, when he had to be careful not to seem like a bully. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, spoke with force and seemed determined to rectify the sleepy and passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Ryan, for his part, praised Romney and tried to soften his image by recounting a personal story of Romney's generosity. Biden, however, brought grief to the stage by sharing his own tragedy, a move that overshadowed Ryan's attempt at humanizing Romney. The vice president's performance was full of moral framing, from his gleeful scoffing to the shaming of his opponent. END OF SUMMARY.
