SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed sharply, with Biden unleashing his inner barroom brawler and mocking Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking funds for his district. Biden also took aim at Romney's "47 percent" remark, while Ryan tried to soften Romney's image by recounting an anecdote about him helping a couple whose children were injured in a car accident. Biden, however, had his own tragic story to share, recalling the car crash that killed his wife and daughter. Martha Raddatz moderated the debate with forcefulness and specificity, a contrast to the passive moderation of the Obama-Romney debate. Biden's performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president's dismal showing in the previous debate. He relished his role, dismissing Ryan's arguments as "malarkey" and interrupting with a blowhard intensity that left Ryan disconcerted. While Ryan held his ground, Biden's withering retorts and patronizing grins left a lasting impression.
END OF SUMMARY.
