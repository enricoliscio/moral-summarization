Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should be formatted with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article describes the debate as spirited, with Biden using a more aggressive approach compared to his previous debates. He mocked Ryan, compared him to Dan Quayle, and used humor effectively. Ryan tried to stay respectful but seemed disconcerted by Biden's intensity. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was more active than previous moderators, pushing for specifics.

I should focus on the key elements: Biden's tactics, Ryan's reactions, the moderator's role, and the overall tone of the debate. I need to make sure the summary captures the contrast between Biden's approach in this debate versus his past ones, especially the 2008 debate with Sarah Palin. Also, mention how Biden mocked Ryan's policies and the personal anecdotes they brought up, like Biden mentioning his own tragedy.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all the main points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to highlight Biden's aggressive and humorous style, Ryan's attempts to maintain decorum, and the moderator's active role in keeping the debate focused.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and covers all the essential information succinctly.

SUMMARY:

Biden mocked Ryan's arguments, comparing him to Dan Quayle and playfully questioning his references to John F. Kennedy. Biden's interruptions and interruptions were relentless, with Ryan often appearing disconcerted. The debate was spirited, with Biden adopting a more combative tone than his 2008 debate with Sarah Palin. Ryan, while respectful, struggled to match Biden's intensity, especially when Biden mocked his stance on Medicare and the stimulus. Biden also capitalized on Ryan's mention of Mitt Romney's "47 percent" remark, though Ryan countered by highlighting Biden's past gaffes. Moderator Martha Raddatz actively pushed both candidates for specifics, unlike the more passive tone in the Obama-Romney debate. Biden's performance was seen as a redemption for the Obama campaign after President Obama's weaker debate. The debate ended with a personal note, as Biden shared his tragic family history in response to Ryan's anecdote about Romney.  
END OF SUMMARY.
