SUMMARY: 

In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came out swinging, using his old friend Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook to paint Paul Ryan as a latter-day Dan Quayle. Biden's sharp and spirited performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after President Obama's dismal debate performance last week. Biden relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He laughed at Ryan's remarks, often and heartily, making him seem like a guest at a comedy club roast. Ryan, on the other hand, seemed disconcerted by Biden's blowhard intensity. The debate was marked by Biden's patronizing grins and withering retorts, which left Ryan looking abashed. The moral of the story is that Biden's aggressive and condescending approach paid off, allowing him to dominate the debate and rescue the Obama campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
