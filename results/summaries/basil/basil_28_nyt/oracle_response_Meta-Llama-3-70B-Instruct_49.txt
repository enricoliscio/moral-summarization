SUMMARY:

In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, using his old Senate colleague Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook to attack Representative Paul D. Ryan. Biden's sharp and spirited debate performance was marked by patronizing grins, withering retorts, and relentless interruptions. He mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his own district, saying "I love that." Ryan held his own, but looked abashed, and reminded Biden of his own propensity for gaffes. The debate moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful in pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. In a poignant moment, Ryan's attempt to soften Romney's image by recounting a charitable act prompted Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash. Overall, Biden's performance was a marked improvement from Obama's dismal debate last week.

END OF SUMMARY.
