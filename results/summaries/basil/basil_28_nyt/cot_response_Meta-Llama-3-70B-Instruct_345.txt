SUMMARY:
In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, relishing his role and addressing Paul Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Biden's sharp and spirited debate style was reminiscent of a "blowhard" intensity, leaving Ryan disconcerted. Ryan tried to be "respectful," but showed "irritation" when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. Biden's "patronizing" grins and "withering" retorts left Ryan looking "abashed." The debate was a chance for Biden to unleash his inner "barroom brawler" and he did so, mocking Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his own district. The night was filled with "infamous" remarks and "gotcha" moments, but in the end, Biden's "withering ripostes" stole the show. END OF SUMMARY.
