SUMMARY:
In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue, using his old friend Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook to shake his head and scoff pityingly at Paul Ryan. Biden's sharp and spirited attacks left Ryan disconcerted, with the vice president often laughing heartily and addressing his opponent as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." Ryan tried to be respectful, but showed irritation when Biden interrupted him to attack his policy on Medicare. Biden's withering retorts and patronizing grins left Ryan abashed, especially when he was mocked for opposing the Obama stimulus while asking for government funds for his own district. The debate was a night of withering ripostes, mostly delivered by Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
