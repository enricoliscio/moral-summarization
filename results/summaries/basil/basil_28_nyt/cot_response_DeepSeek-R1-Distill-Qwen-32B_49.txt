Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan vice presidential debate, but with a focus on preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about the 2012 debate where Biden, the vice president, uses aggressive tactics against Ryan. The author uses several morally charged words to describe Biden's behavior, such as "scoffing pityingly," "paint," "malarkey," "dismissive," "laughed," "roast," "sharp," "spirited," "lacerating," "disconcerted," "blowhard," "intensity," "patronizing," "mocked," "gaffes," "gotcha," "amused," "tragedy," "praise," and "soften."

Now, I need to create a summary that includes these words while concisely capturing the essence of the debate. I should start by highlighting Biden's aggressive tactics, his use of humor and interruptions, and how Ryan responded. I'll mention the moral implications, like Biden's mockery and Ryan's attempt to soften Romney's image, leading to Biden bringing up his personal tragedy.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it to first introduce the debate's context, then describe Biden's approach, Ryan's reactions, and the moderator's role. I'll ensure that the morally framed words are naturally integrated without forcing them.

Let me draft the summary, checking each sentence to include as many of the identified words as possible without making it sound unnatural. I'll also make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over 200 words.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's tone and content. If any words are missing or if the flow is off, I'll adjust accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
The vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan was marked by Biden's aggressive and dismissive tactics, as he mocked Ryan's arguments and interrupted him repeatedly. Biden, seeking to redeem the Obama campaign after President Obama's poor performance, adopted a sharp and spirited tone, often laughing at Ryan's remarks, making it seem like a comedy club roast. Ryan, though respectful, appeared disconcerted by Biden's relentless interruptions and patronizing grins. Biden mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his district, and also criticized Romney's "47 percent" remark, prompting Ryan to remind Biden of his own gaffes. The debate was laced with lacerating blows, as Biden's withering retorts left Ryan occasionally abashed. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, actively pushed the candidates for specifics, avoiding the passive approach of the previous debate. Ryan tried to soften Romney's image by sharing a story about Romney's kindness, but Biden countered by recounting his personal tragedy, the car crash that killed his family. The debate was a clash of styles, with Biden's intensity and humor contrasting with Ryan's choirboy demeanor. END OF SUMMARY.
