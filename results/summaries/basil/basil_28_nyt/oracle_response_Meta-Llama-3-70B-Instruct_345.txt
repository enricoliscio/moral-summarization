SUMMARY: 

In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden employed his old Senate colleague Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook, shaking his head and scoffing at Representative Paul D. Ryan. Biden relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He laughed at Ryan's remarks, seemingly like a guest at a comedy club roast. Ryan, trying to be respectful, showed irritation when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. The night was Biden's chance to unleash his inner barroom brawler, letting loose with patronizing grins and withering retorts. Ryan held his own, but looked abashed when Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus yet asking for government funds for his own district. The debate was sharp and spirited, with both candidates delivering lacerating blows. Biden was not amused when Ryan reminded him of his own propensity for gaffes, but the vice president's tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash, was a poignant moment.
