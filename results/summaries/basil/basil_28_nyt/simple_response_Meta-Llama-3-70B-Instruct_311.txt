SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden came to President Obama's rescue in the vice presidential debate, using his old Senate colleague Lloyd Bentsen's 1988 playbook to shake his head and scoff at Representative Paul D. Ryan. Biden relished his role, addressing Ryan as "my friend" while dismissing his arguments as "malarkey." He laughed heartily at Ryan's remarks, seeming like a guest at a comedy club roast. Ryan, trying to be respectful, showed irritation when Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. Biden unleashed his inner barroom brawler, singeing Ryan with patronizing grins and withering retorts. The debate was sharp and spirited, with both candidates delivering lacerating blows. Moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News pushed the candidates to be specific and changed subjects abruptly, determined to be less passive than Jim Lehrer of PBS. In the end, Biden's relentless barrage and mocking tone left Ryan looking abashed.

END OF SUMMARY.
