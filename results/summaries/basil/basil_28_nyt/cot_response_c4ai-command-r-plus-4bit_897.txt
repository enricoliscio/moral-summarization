SUMMARY:
Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Paul D. Ryan faced off in a sharp and spirited vice presidential debate, with Biden taking a page out of Lloyd Bentsen's playbook and unleashing his inner *barroom* brawler. Biden relished his role, dismissing Ryan's arguments as *malarkey* and scoffing at him with *patronizing* grins and withering retorts. He mocked Ryan for opposing the Obama stimulus while seeking government funds for his district, and took aim at Romney's "47 percent" comment. Ryan, meanwhile, tried to be respectful but showed irritation at Biden's interruptive barrage. Biden also brought up his own personal tragedy in response to Ryan's praise of Romney's charitable actions. The moderator, Martha Raddatz, was forceful and pushed the candidates to be specific, a contrast to the passive moderation of the first presidential debate. Biden's performance was a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president's dismal showing in his first debate with Romney.
END OF SUMMARY.
