SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that the production and sale of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, and Colorado's legalization has undermined the US Constitution. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the suit is without merit and stems from non-enforcement of federal laws. The lawsuit could have implications for all state marijuana laws, as a Supreme Court ruling in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma could unravel legalization efforts. Pro-legalization advocates argue that the lawsuit is an attempt to dictate Colorado's laws and that marijuana remains widely available despite federal prohibition. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) called the lawsuit "outrageous" and an interference with Colorado's right to enact policies benefiting its citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
