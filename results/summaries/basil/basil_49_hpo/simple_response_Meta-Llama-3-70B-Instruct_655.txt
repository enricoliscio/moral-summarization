SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution gives federal law precedence over state law, and that Colorado's legalization is in violation of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers has vowed to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit." The outcome of the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially putting all state marijuana laws in jeopardy. While a majority of Americans now support marijuana legalization, the federal government could still push back against state legalizations. Critics of the lawsuit argue that it is an overreach of power and an attempt to undermine the will of Colorado's voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
