Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user provided a list of those words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado over its marijuana legalization, arguing it's unconstitutional. Colorado is defending its laws. The article mentions the Supremacy Clause, the Controlled Substances Act, and the potential impact on other states.

I should highlight the moral aspects. Words like "prohibits," "undermined," "illegal," "trafficked," "injuring," "enforce," "violation," "acting," "wasting," "forcing," and "interference" are key. I need to weave these into the summary naturally.

I'll start by stating the lawsuit and the constitutional argument. Then mention Colorado's defense and the potential consequences if the lawsuit succeeds. I'll also touch on the broader implications, like the federalist system and the ongoing debate over marijuana policy.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to include the main parties, their arguments, and the implications, using the moral terms to frame the narrative as the author did.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates federal law and the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argued that Colorado's actions "undermine" federal law, which "prohibits" marijuana production and sale. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers defended the state's laws, stating the lawsuit "appears without merit" and is focused on federal non-enforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved policy. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt claimed Colorado's "illegal" marijuana is being "trafficked" across state lines, "injuring" neighboring states. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Colorado's recreational marijuana program under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which still "regulates" marijuana as illegal. Colorado's legalization, along with similar laws in other states, relies on federal guidance not "enforcing" prohibition. If the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, all state marijuana laws could be "unraveled." Critics argue the lawsuit "violates" federalist principles, while supporters see it as a necessary "action" to uphold federal "prohibition." The debate highlights tensions between state "legalization" and federal "prohibition," with implications for national drug policy and "interference" in state sovereignty. END OF SUMMARY.
