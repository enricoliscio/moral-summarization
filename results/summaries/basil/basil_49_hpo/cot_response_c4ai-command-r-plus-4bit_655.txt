SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the constitutionality of its marijuana legalization under the U.S. Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs argue that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is *unconstitutional* and *illegal* under federal law, and that the flow of *illegal* marijuana across state lines is *injuring* neighboring states. Colorado's attorney general intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the suit is *without merit*. Supporters of the lawsuit, such as anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argue that marijuana legalization is in clear violation of federal law and has consequences for all Americans. On the other hand, critics of the lawsuit call it *outrageous* and accuse Nebraska officials of being *bullies*. They argue that Nebraska is wasting taxpayer dollars and that Colorado's voters should be able to enact policies that benefit their citizens without interference. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the future of state marijuana laws across the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
