Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming Colorado's recreational marijuana laws are unconstitutional under federal law. Nebraska's Attorney General, Jon Bruning, says federal law prohibits marijuana, so Colorado's action undermines the Constitution. Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, counters that the lawsuit lacks merit and they'll defend their laws.

The article mentions the Supremacy Clause, which gives federal law precedence over state law. Oklahoma's Attorney General, Scott Pruitt, argues that Colorado's marijuana is crossing state lines, harming their states. It also notes that while some states have legalized marijuana, it's still illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. The states only managed to legalize it because of federal guidance not targeting state-legal operations.

Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, with shops opening in 2014. Currently, 23 states and DC have medical marijuana, and four states plus DC have recreational. The article discusses the federal stance, noting that while the government hasn't acted against state laws, a new president could change that. Experts like Jeff Miron argue Congress needs to act on federal policy. Anti-legalization groups support the lawsuit, while pro-legalization groups oppose it, calling the lawsuit meritless and a waste of money.

So, the main points are: lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma, constitutional argument based on Supremacy Clause, Colorado's defense, the federal law vs. state laws, implications if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, expert opinions, and reactions from both sides.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key actors, their arguments, the legal basis, and the implications. Also, mention the current status of marijuana laws and the potential impact of the Supreme Court decision.

I should structure it as: introduction of the lawsuit, the arguments from both sides, the legal background, the implications, and the reactions. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without going into too much detail. I'll start with the states filing the lawsuit, their claim, Colorado's response, the legal basis (Supremacy Clause), the impact on neighboring states, the federal law context, and the potential consequences if the lawsuit succeeds. Then, mention the expert opinions and the reactions from both pro and anti-legalization groups. Finally, note the current status and the uncertainty about federal action.

I should avoid including too many quotes but summarize the arguments. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically from one point to the next, covering all essential aspects without unnecessary details.

Now, putting it all together, making sure it's under 200 words and clear.
