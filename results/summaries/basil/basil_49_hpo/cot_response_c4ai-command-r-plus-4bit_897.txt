SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the legalization of recreational marijuana in the state. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's decision to legalize marijuana is *unconstitutional* and *violates* federal law, which still prohibits the production and sale of marijuana. The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that the legalization of marijuana in Colorado has negative consequences on neighboring states and that the *illegal* products are being trafficked across state lines. Colorado's attorney general intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the lawsuit is "without merit". Supporters of the lawsuit, such as the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argue that Colorado's decision *undermines* federal law and has consequences for all Americans. Opponents of the lawsuit, including representatives from the Marijuana Policy Project and the Marijuana Industry Group, criticize Nebraska officials for attempting to *interfere* with Colorado's marijuana laws and for *wasting* taxpayer dollars on a *bully* tactic. They argue that marijuana remains *illegally* accessible in Nebraska and Oklahoma despite the federal war on drugs, and that a reversal of Colorado's legalization could put violent criminal organizations back in charge of the marijuana trade. The outcome of this legal challenge could have significant implications for the future of state-level marijuana legalization across the country.
