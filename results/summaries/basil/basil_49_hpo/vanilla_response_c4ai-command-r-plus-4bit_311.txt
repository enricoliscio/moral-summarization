SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the legalization of recreational marijuana in the state. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization is unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause as marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that the illegal marijuana products are being trafficked across state lines, causing harm to neighboring states. Colorado's attorney general intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the lawsuit is without merit. Supporters of the lawsuit, such as the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argue that legalization violates federal law. Opponents, including the Marijuana Policy Project, criticize the lawsuit as a waste of taxpayer dollars and an attempt to undermine the will of Colorado's voters. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for state marijuana laws across the country.
