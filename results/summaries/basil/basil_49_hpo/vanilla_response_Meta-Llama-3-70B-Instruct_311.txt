SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution gives federal law precedence over state law, and since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Colorado's legalization is invalid. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, saying the lawsuit is without merit and stems from non-enforcement of federal laws. The outcome of the lawsuit could have implications for all state marijuana laws, which could be unraveled if the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma. Pro-marijuana advocates argue that the lawsuit is an attempt to dictate Colorado's laws and that the federal government should respect state sovereignty.

END OF SUMMARY.
