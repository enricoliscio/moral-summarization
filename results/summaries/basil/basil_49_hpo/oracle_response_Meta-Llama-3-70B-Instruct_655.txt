SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado has "undermined" the US Constitution and hopes the Supreme Court will "uphold" constitutional principles. However, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers vows to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit". The lawsuit claims that Colorado's legalization is in "violation" of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act and that the "trafficking" of marijuana across state lines is "injuring" neighboring states. Pro-legalization advocates argue that Nebraska and Oklahoma are "acting like bullies" and "wasting" taxpayer dollars by trying to "dictate" Colorado's marijuana laws. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws could be "unraveled". END OF SUMMARY.
