Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because federal law prohibits it. Colorado's attorney general is defending their laws, saying the lawsuit is without merit. The Supremacy Clause is mentioned, which says federal law takes precedence over state law. 

I also note that other states have legalized marijuana, and the federal government hasn't enforced the Controlled Substances Act against them. The article mentions support and opposition, with some arguing that Colorado's actions affect neighboring states, and others saying it's a states' rights issue. There's also a mention of the potential impact on the marijuana industry and criminal organizations if the lawsuit succeeds.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma see it as a federal law issue, while Colorado and supporters see it as states' rights and the will of the people. I should keep the summary under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

I'll structure the summary to include the lawsuit, the constitutional arguments, the states' stances, the implications if the lawsuit wins, and the reactions from different groups. I'll make sure to highlight the moral perspectives, like the federal vs. state rights and the impact on neighboring states versus states' autonomy.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and ensuring all key points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution under the Supremacy Clause, as federal law prohibits marijuana. Colorado's attorney general counters that the lawsuit lacks merit and that the state's voters made the decision. The lawsuit highlights tensions between federal and state laws, with supporters of Colorado's laws emphasizing states' rights and opponents arguing that marijuana legalization harms neighboring states. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, it could jeopardize marijuana laws nationwide. Proponents of legalization argue that the lawsuit is misguided and that federal inaction has allowed states to legalize marijuana. Critics, however, stress the federal government's authority and the potential consequences of state defiance. The case underscores the ongoing debate over marijuana policy and federalism in the U.S.  
END OF SUMMARY.
