SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the legalization of recreational marijuana in the state. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization of marijuana is unconstitutional and violates the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause because federal law still prohibits the production, sale, and distribution of marijuana. The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma believe that Colorado's legalization has negative consequences on their states and that federal law should take precedence. Colorado's attorney general plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the lawsuit is without merit. Supporters of the lawsuit, such as the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argue that legalization is in violation of federal law. Opponents of the lawsuit, such as the Marijuana Policy Project and the Marijuana Industry Group, believe that Nebraska and Oklahoma are overreaching and that the lawsuit is a waste of taxpayer dollars. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for state marijuana laws across the country.
