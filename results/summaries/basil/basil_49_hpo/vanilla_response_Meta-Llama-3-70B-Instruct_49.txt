SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The lawsuit argues that the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution gives federal law precedence over state law, and since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Colorado's legalization is invalid. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, arguing that the lawsuit is without merit and stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than Colorado's choices. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws could be in jeopardy. The lawsuit highlights the precarious nature of state marijuana laws, which could be unraveled if the federal government decides to enforce prohibition.

END OF SUMMARY.
