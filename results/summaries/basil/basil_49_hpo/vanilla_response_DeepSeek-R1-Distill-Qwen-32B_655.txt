SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning claims Colorado's actions undermine the U.S. Constitution, while Colorado Attorney General John Suthers defends the state's laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit. The lawsuit focuses on Colorado's marijuana distribution affecting neighboring states, though Colorado maintains the issue stems from federal non-enforcement. Marijuana remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, but several states have legalized it, with federal guidance allowing state laws to stand. A Supreme Court ruling against Colorado could jeopardize all state marijuana laws. Supporters of legalization, like Harvard economist Jeff Miron, warn of federal action under a new administration, while opponents, such as anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, support the lawsuit. Colorado's marijuana industry and supporters argue the lawsuit is misguided and a waste of resources. END OF SUMMARY.
