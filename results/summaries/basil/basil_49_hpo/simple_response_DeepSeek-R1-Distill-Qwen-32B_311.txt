Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization is unconstitutional because federal law prohibits marijuana. Colorado is defending its laws, saying the suit is without merit. The article also mentions the Supremacy Clause and the potential impact on other states if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma are concerned about federal law and the impact on neighboring states. Colorado and supporters argue that states should have the right to decide their own laws, and that the lawsuit is unfounded. 

I should structure the summary to include the key players, their arguments, and the implications. I'll mention the lawsuit, the constitutional basis, Colorado's response, the potential consequences if the suit succeeds, and the broader debate on federalism and state rights.

I also need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include all important aspects. I'll start with the states filing the suit, their reasoning, Colorado's defense, the Supremacy Clause, the potential impact, and the ongoing debate.

Let me make sure I'm not missing any critical points. The article mentions the Controlled Substances Act, the federal stance, and the support from both sides. I should include that federal law trumps state law, but also note that the federal government hasn't enforced it much so far.

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution under the Supremacy Clause, as federal law prohibits marijuana. Colorado's attorney general counters that the lawsuit lacks merit and that the state's voters have the right to determine their own laws. The suit highlights tensions between state sovereignty and federal authority, with Nebraska and Oklahoma claiming Colorado's actions harm neighboring states. Supporters of Colorado's laws argue that states should have the freedom to legalize marijuana without federal interference, while opponents, including anti-legalization groups, emphasize the violation of federal law. The outcome could impact marijuana laws nationwide, with some experts warning that a ruling against Colorado could jeopardize state-level legalization efforts. The case underscores the broader debate over federalism, state rights, and the future of marijuana policy in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
