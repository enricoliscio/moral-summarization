SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional and undermines the US Constitution. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers vows to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit". Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado's legalization is illegal under federal law and is injuring neighboring states. Pro-legalization advocates call the lawsuit an "outrageous" attempt to overturn the will of Colorado's voters, with some labeling Nebraska officials as "bullies" who are "wasting" taxpayer dollars. The outcome of the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially putting all state marijuana laws in jeopardy. END OF SUMMARY.
