SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional as it violates the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which gives precedence to federal law. Attorney General Jon Bruning of Nebraska and Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma argue that marijuana remains illegal under federal law and that Colorado's legalization has led to trafficking across state lines. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the suit is without merit. Harvard economist Jeff Miron and Rep. Jared Polis highlight the precarious nature of state marijuana laws, which could be overturned by a new president in 2017. Anti-legalization groups support the lawsuit, while pro-legalization groups call it a waste of taxpayer money and an attack on states' rights. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for state marijuana laws across the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
