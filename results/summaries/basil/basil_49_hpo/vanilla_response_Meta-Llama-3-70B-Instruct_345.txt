SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The lawsuit argues that the production and sale of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, and Colorado's laws undermine the US Constitution. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and stems from non-enforcement of federal laws. The lawsuit cites the Supremacy Clause, which states that federal law takes precedence over state law. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws could be in jeopardy. The lawsuit has sparked debate, with some supporting the action and others calling it an overreach of power.

END OF SUMMARY.
