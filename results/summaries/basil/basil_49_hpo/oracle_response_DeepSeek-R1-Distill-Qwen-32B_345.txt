Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided and keep the summary under 200 words.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of marijuana is unconstitutional because federal law prohibits it. Colorado is defending its laws, saying the lawsuit lacks merit. The article also mentions the Supremacy Clause and the Controlled Substances Act. There are quotes from various officials, both supporting and opposing the lawsuit.

Next, I should identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "prohibits," "undermined," "uphold," "legalization," "trafficked," "injur[ing]," etc. I need to make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the lawsuit, the constitutional argument, Colorado's defense, the impact on neighboring states, the federal laws involved, and the broader implications. Then, I'll incorporate the moral terms to frame the summary accordingly.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the lawsuit, the arguments from both sides, the legal basis, and the potential consequences. I'll also mention the support and criticism the lawsuit has received, using terms like "acting," "wasting," "filing," and "outrageous."

Finally, I'll make sure the summary stays within the word limit and that all the key moral points are addressed. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, sticking strictly to summarizing the article while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming Colorado's recreational marijuana legalization violates federal law and the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. They argue that federal law prohibits marijuana production and sale, and Colorado's actions undermine constitutional principles. Colorado defends its laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit and is based on non-enforcement of federal laws rather than Colorado's voter-approved policy. The states argue that Colorado's distributed marijuana is trafficked across state lines, injuring neighboring states. Colorado counters that federal guidance has allowed states to legalize marijuana, and the lawsuit is an attempt to overturn state decisions. Critics, like Kevin Sabet, support the lawsuit, while advocates, such as Mason Tvert, call it "outrageous" and a waste of taxpayer money. The case highlights the tension between state legalization and federal prohibition, with potential implications for all state marijuana laws. END OF SUMMARY.
