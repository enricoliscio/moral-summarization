SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional and undermines the US Constitution. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers vows to vigorously defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit." The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization is illegal under federal law, and that it is injuring neighboring states like Oklahoma and Nebraska. However, supporters of marijuana legalization, such as Rep. Jared Polis, call the lawsuit "outrageous" and an attempt to interfere with Colorado's right to enact its own policies. The outcome of the lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences, potentially unraveling all state marijuana laws. END OF SUMMARY.
