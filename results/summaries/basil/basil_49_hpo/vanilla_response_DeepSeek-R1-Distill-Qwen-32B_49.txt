Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a federal lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. They argue it's unconstitutional under federal law. Colorado's Attorney General is defending their laws. The Supremacy Clause is mentioned, which says federal law takes precedence. The lawsuit claims Colorado's actions affect neighboring states. 

I should note the key points: the states involved, the legal basis (Supremacy Clause), Colorado's stance, and the implications if the lawsuit succeeds. Also, mention the support and opposition from various groups. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to highlight the potential impact on other states if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado. 

I need to structure it clearly, starting with the lawsuit, the arguments from both sides, and the broader implications. Avoid getting bogged down in details like the specific numbers of states or the year of legalization unless it's crucial. Focus on the main conflict and the significance of the case.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, as federal law still prohibits marijuana. Colorado's Attorney General defends the state's laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit. The case highlights tensions between state and federal marijuana policies, with implications for all states with legal marijuana. If the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, it could jeopardize state marijuana laws nationwide. Supporters of Colorado's laws argue that states should have the right to determine their own policies, while opponents, including anti-legalization groups, emphasize federal law's authority. The outcome could shape the future of marijuana policy in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
