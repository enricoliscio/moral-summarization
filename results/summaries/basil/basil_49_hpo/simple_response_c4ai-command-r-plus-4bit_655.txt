SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have taken an immoral and unjustified stance against the sovereign will of Colorado and its citizens by filing a federal lawsuit against the state's legalization of marijuana. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's progressive and compassionate decision to legalize marijuana is unconstitutional due to federal prohibition. However, this lawsuit is a disgraceful attempt to undermine the rights of states to make their own laws and the will of their citizens. Colorado's Attorney General has vowed to defend the state's marijuana laws, and supporters of marijuana policy reform have criticized the bullying tactics of Nebraska and Oklahoma. The lawsuit highlights the precarious nature of state marijuana laws, which could be threatened by a change in federal enforcement priorities or a Supreme Court ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. This dispute underscores the urgent need for federal marijuana policy reform to respect state sovereignty and the democratic will of citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
