Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Hmm, the original article presents different viewpoints, so I should make sure to include those.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization is unconstitutional because federal law still prohibits marijuana. They're using the Supremacy Clause, which says federal law overrides state law. Colorado is defending its laws, saying the lawsuit lacks merit. They mention that neighboring states are worried about marijuana coming in, but Colorado thinks the issue is more about federal non-enforcement.

I should note the arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado's actions affect them, while Colorado counters that the suit isn't about state laws but federal enforcement. Also, there are mentions of support for and against the lawsuit from different groups and experts.

The moral framing here seems to be about states' rights versus federal authority. On one side, Nebraska and Oklahoma are concerned about federal law being upheld, while Colorado and supporters argue that states should have the right to decide their own laws. There's also the aspect of the impact on neighboring states and the potential consequences if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to include the lawsuit, the arguments from both states, the moral implications, and the potential consequences if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado. I should also mention the support and criticism from different groups to show the moral divide.

Let me make sure I capture all the key points without going into too much detail. I'll start with the lawsuit, then the arguments from each state, the moral stance on states' rights versus federal law, the consequences, and the reactions from supporters and critics. That should cover the main aspects while preserving the moral framing.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary elements.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution under the Supremacy Clause, as federal law still prohibits marijuana. Colorado defends its laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit and is focused on federal non-enforcement rather than state policy. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado's actions harm neighboring states by facilitating marijuana trafficking. Colorado counters that the lawsuit is an overreach, as states should have the right to determine their own laws. Supporters of Colorado, like the Marijuana Policy Project, criticize the lawsuit as a waste of resources, while opponents, such as anti-legalization groups, argue that Colorado's actions violate federal law and have broader consequences. The case highlights the tension between states' rights and federal authority, with potential implications for all state marijuana laws if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado. END OF SUMMARY.
