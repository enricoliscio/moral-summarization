Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado over marijuana legalization, claiming it's unconstitutional. They argue that federal law prohibits marijuana, so Colorado's laws undermine the Constitution. Colorado, on the other hand, believes the lawsuit is without merit and will defend their state laws.

I need to identify the morally charged words the author used. Words like "prohibits," "undermined," "uphold," "trafficked," "injuring," "legalization," "enforce," "prohibition," "violation," "acting," "wasting," "filing," "forcing," "put," "back," "attempting," "overturn," "enact," "interference." I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words. I'll start by stating the lawsuit, then the arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue federal law takes precedence, while Colorado defends their voters' decision. Mention the potential impact if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, affecting other states. Include the supporters and critics, highlighting the moral stances each side takes. Make sure to use the moral words to frame the conflict accurately.

I need to structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the lawsuit, then the arguments, the implications, and the reactions. Keeping it under 200 words while including all necessary points. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming Colorado's recreational marijuana legalization violates federal law and the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. They argue that federal law prohibits marijuana production, sale, and distribution, and Colorado's actions undermine constitutional principles. Colorado defends its laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit and is an attempt to overturn voter decisions. The plaintiffs argue Colorado's marijuana is being trafficked across state lines, injuring neighboring states. Colorado counters that the suit focuses on federal non-enforcement rather than state choices. Marijuana remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, but states have legalized it due to federal guidance. A Supreme Court ruling in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma could jeopardize all state marijuana laws. Supporters of legalization, like the Marijuana Policy Project, criticize the lawsuit as a waste of taxpayer money, while anti-legalization groups applaud it. The debate highlights tensions between federal prohibition and state legalization efforts, with implications for federalism and drug policy reform.  
END OF SUMMARY.
