SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that Colorado's actions have "undermined" the US Constitution and are "injuring" neighboring states. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers plans to "vigorously defend" the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit". The lawsuit cites the Supremacy Clause, which states that federal law takes precedence over state law, and argues that marijuana remains illegal under federal law. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws could be "unraveled". The lawsuit has sparked debate, with some arguing that it's an attempt to "dictate" Colorado's laws and "interfere" with the will of its voters, while others see it as a necessary step to "uphold" federal law and prevent the "trafficking" of illegal products across state lines.
