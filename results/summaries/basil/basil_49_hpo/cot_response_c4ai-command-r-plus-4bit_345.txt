SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the constitutionality of its recreational marijuana legalization. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law is *unconstitutional* under the U.S. Constitution's *Supremacy Clause* because marijuana remains *illegal* under federal law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning claims that Colorado has *undermined* the Constitution and hopes the Supreme Court will uphold federal law, which takes precedence over state law. The lawsuit asserts that Colorado's legalization has led to *trafficked* marijuana across state lines, *injuring* neighboring states. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers intends to *vigorously* defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the suit is without merit. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for state marijuana laws across the country, with some arguing that a ruling in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma could put all state marijuana laws in jeopardy. The case highlights the ongoing tension between state and federal marijuana policies and the precarious nature of legalization efforts. Some supporters of legalization have criticized the lawsuit as an *outrageous interference* in state policies.
