Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave, so I have to make sure I capture the different perspectives presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because federal law still prohibits it. They're using the Supremacy Clause, which says federal law overrides state law. Colorado's attorney general is defending their state laws, saying the lawsuit lacks merit. 

I notice the article mentions that several states have legalized marijuana, but it's still illegal under federal law. The federal government hasn't enforced it much, but there's a risk a new administration could change that. There are quotes from supporters and opponents of legalization, highlighting the moral and legal debates.

I need to include the key points: the lawsuit, the constitutional argument, Colorado's defense, the implications if the lawsuit succeeds, and the differing opinions on the issue. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral framing, like the debate over states' rights versus federal law and the impact on public safety versus economic and policy progress.

I'll structure the summary to first state the lawsuit, then the arguments from both sides, the implications, and the expert opinions. I'll make sure to mention that the federal government hasn't enforced the laws but could in the future, and the potential consequences for state laws. Also, include the reactions from both supporters and opponents to show the moral debate.

Let me make sure I don't miss any important details. The article mentions that 23 states and DC have medical marijuana, four have recreational, and the federal stance is key. The lawsuit could affect all state marijuana laws. Experts like Miron and Sabet have different views, and industry groups and politicians are reacting as well.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Now, I'll condense this into a coherent summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally while preserving the moral aspects presented in the article.
