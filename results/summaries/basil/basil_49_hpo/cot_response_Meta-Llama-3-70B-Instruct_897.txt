SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers vows to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit." Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado has "undermined" the US Constitution, while Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt claims that the illegal products being distributed in Colorado are being trafficked across state lines, "injuring" neighboring states. Pro-legalization advocates, including Rep. Jared Polis, call the lawsuit "outrageous" and argue that it's an attempt to overturn the will of Colorado's voters. They believe that Nebraska and Oklahoma are acting like "bullies," trying to dictate Colorado's marijuana laws and wasting taxpayer dollars. END OF SUMMARY.
