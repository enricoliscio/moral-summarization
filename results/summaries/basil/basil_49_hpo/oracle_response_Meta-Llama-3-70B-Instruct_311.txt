SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado has "undermined" the US Constitution and hopes the Supreme Court will "uphold" constitutional principles. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit". The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization is in "violation" of the federal Controlled Substances Act, which "prohibits" the production and sale of marijuana. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt claims that the "trafficked" marijuana is "injuring" neighboring states. The outcome could put all state marijuana laws in jeopardy. Critics of the lawsuit, including Rep. Jared Polis, argue that Nebraska and Oklahoma are "acting like bullies" and "wasting" taxpayer dollars by trying to "dictate" Colorado's marijuana laws.
