Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the ethical implications and the language used in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado over its marijuana legalization, arguing it's unconstitutional under federal law. Colorado defends its right to legalize. The article mentions the Supremacy Clause, the Controlled Substances Act, and the implications if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. These include "prohibits," "undermined," "uphold," "legalization," "trafficked," "injuring," "enforce," "prohibition," "violation," "acting," "wasting," "filing," "forcing," "put," "back," "attempting," "overturn," "enact," "interference." I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between states' rights and federal law, emphasizing the moral arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma are concerned about Colorado's actions affecting them, while Colorado argues that the lawsuit is meritless and a waste of resources.

I should keep the summary concise, around 200 words, and ensure it flows logically, starting with the lawsuit, the arguments from both sides, and the potential implications. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered, preserving the moral perspective as requested.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law, which prohibits the production and sale of marijuana. They argue that Colorado's actions undermine the U.S. Constitution and the Supremacy Clause, which prioritizes federal law over state law. Colorado, however, defends its marijuana laws, stating the lawsuit is without merit and a waste of taxpayer money. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers emphasizes that the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws, not Colorado's voter-approved policies. The lawsuit highlights the tension between state legalization and federal prohibition, as marijuana remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. Colorado's legalization, enacted in 2012, has led to retail sales since 2014, while 23 states and D.C. have legalized medical marijuana. Critics, like anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argue Colorado's decisions have consequences for neighboring states and violate federal law. Supporters, such as the Marijuana Policy Project, call the lawsuit meritless, accusing Nebraska and Oklahoma of acting like bullies and interfering with Colorado's right to enact its own policies. The outcome could impact all state marijuana laws, with some experts warning that a federal crackdown could revive criminal organizations if legalization is overturned. END OF SUMMARY.
