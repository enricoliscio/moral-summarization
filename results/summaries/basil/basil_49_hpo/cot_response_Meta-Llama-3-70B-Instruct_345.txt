SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional and undermines the US Constitution. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers vows to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit." Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado's legalization is illegal under federal law, which takes precedence over state law. However, proponents of marijuana legalization, such as Rep. Jared Polis, call the lawsuit "outrageous" and an attempt to interfere with Colorado's right to enact policies that benefit its citizens. The outcome of the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially unraveling all state marijuana laws. END OF SUMMARY.
