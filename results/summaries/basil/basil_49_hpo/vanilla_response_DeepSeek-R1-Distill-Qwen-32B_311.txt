Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a federal lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado's laws are unconstitutional because marijuana is still illegal under federal law. The Supremacy Clause is mentioned, which means federal law takes precedence. 

Colorado's attorney general is defending their laws, saying they're not surprised because neighboring states are worried about marijuana coming in. They believe the lawsuit is without merit. 

The article also mentions that other states like Washington, Oregon, and Alaska have similar laws, which are still illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. States have been able to legalize it because of federal guidance, but if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, all state laws could be at risk. 

There's some mention of public opinion favoring legalization and experts like Jeff Miron suggesting Congress needs to act. Anti-legalization groups support the lawsuit, while supporters of legalization, like MPP, oppose it. 

I should include the main points: the lawsuit, the constitutional arguments, the potential impact on other states, and the differing opinions on the issue. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution under the Supremacy Clause, as federal law still prohibits marijuana. Colorado's attorney general defends the state's laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit and is based on non-enforcement of federal laws rather than Colorado's voter-approved policy. The lawsuit highlights concerns about marijuana trafficking across state lines, impacting neighboring states. Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, with 23 states and D.C. now legalizing medical marijuana. While public support for legalization is growing, a Supreme Court ruling against Colorado could jeopardize all state marijuana laws. Experts and advocacy groups are divided, with some calling for federal action to resolve the conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
