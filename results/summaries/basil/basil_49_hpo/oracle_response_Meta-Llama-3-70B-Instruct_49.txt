SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado has "undermined" the US Constitution and hopes the Supreme Court will "uphold" constitutional principles. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit". The lawsuit claims that Colorado's legalization of marijuana is illegal under federal law, which "prohibits" the production and sale of marijuana. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt argues that the "illegal products" being distributed in Colorado are being "trafficked" across state lines, "injuring" neighboring states. The lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially putting all state marijuana laws in jeopardy of being "unraveled". Critics of the lawsuit argue that Nebraska and Oklahoma are "acting like bullies" and "wasting" taxpayer dollars.
