Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. 

I should start by identifying the morally framed words. Let me go through the text again. Words like "unconstitutional," "prohibits," "undermine," "uphold," "grievance," "non-enforcement," "trafficked," "injure," "illegal," "precarious," "prohibition," "hands-off," "bullies," "outrageous," "interference," and "federalist" stand out as they carry moral implications.

Now, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating the lawsuit and the constitutional argument. Then, mention Colorado's defense and the support from other states. Highlight the moral arguments from both sides, including the economic and social impacts. Finally, touch on the implications of the lawsuit and the broader debate on federal vs. state laws.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each paragraph isn't too long. Also, I need to preserve the moral framing by using the identified words in context.

Wait, I should double-check that I'm including all the key moral words without forcing them. They should fit naturally into the summary. For example, "unconstitutional" and "prohibition" are central to the legal argument, while "bullies" and "outrageous" convey the moral stance against the lawsuit.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me review the summary to ensure it's under 200 words and that all the moral terms are appropriately included. Okay, that should do it.

**SUMMARY:**  
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. They argue that Colorado's actions violate the Supremacy Clause, as federal law prohibits marijuana. Colorado defends its laws, stating the lawsuit is without merit and driven by federal non-enforcement concerns. The case highlights tensions between state and federal marijuana policies, with supporters of legalization arguing it is a state rights issue. Opponents, including anti-legalization groups, claim Colorado's actions harm neighboring states and violate federal law. The outcome could impact marijuana laws nationwide. Critics accuse Nebraska and Oklahoma of overstepping, calling their action "outrageous" and "bullies" behavior. The debate underscores the federalist system's balance between state autonomy and federal authority. END OF SUMMARY.
