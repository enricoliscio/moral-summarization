SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that the production and sale of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, and Colorado's actions have undermined the US Constitution. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and stems from non-enforcement of federal laws. The lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences, potentially unraveling all state marijuana laws if the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma. Supporters of marijuana legalization argue that the lawsuit is an attempt to dictate Colorado's laws and enforce prohibition, wasting taxpayer dollars and acting against the will of Colorado's voters.
