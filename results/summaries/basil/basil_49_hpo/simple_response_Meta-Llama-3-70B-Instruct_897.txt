SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution gives federal law precedence over state law, and since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Colorado's legalization is invalid. Colorado's Attorney General, however, intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, arguing that the lawsuit is without merit and stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially jeopardizing all state marijuana laws if the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma. Pro-legalization advocates argue that this lawsuit is an attempt to undermine the will of Colorado's voters and that it's time for Congress to act on federal marijuana policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
