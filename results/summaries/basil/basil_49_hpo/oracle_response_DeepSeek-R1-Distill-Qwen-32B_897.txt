Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The moral framing is important here, so I should focus on the words the author used that carry a moral connotation.

Looking at the article, the key points are that Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado because they believe Colorado's legalization violates federal law. They argue that under the Supremacy Clause, federal law (which prohibits marijuana) should override state laws. Colorado, on the other hand, defends its decision, saying the lawsuit is without merit and that they're acting within their state's rights.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "prohibits," "undermined," "uphold," "trafficked," "injuring," "violation," "acting," "wasting," "filing," "forcing," "put," "back," "attempting," "overturn," "enact," and "interference" are important.

I should structure the summary to first mention the lawsuit, then the arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma are claiming Colorado is undermining the Constitution and that the Supremacy Clause makes Colorado's law unconstitutional. Colorado counters that the lawsuit is meritless and that the states are interfering.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the lawsuit, then each state's stance, the legal arguments, and the implications. I should end with the ongoing debate and the potential impact on federal-state relations.

Let me make sure I include all the key morally charged words without making the summary too long. I'll need to balance between being comprehensive and concise. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the user's request.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all the moral terms are included and that the summary flows logically, preserving the original article's framing. I should also check that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. If it's too long, I'll trim it down without losing essential points.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates federal law under the Supremacy Clause. They claim Colorado has undermined the U.S. Constitution by allowing the production and sale of marijuana, which remains prohibited under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. Colorado defends its laws, stating the suit is without merit and that neighboring states are interfering with its voters' decision. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado's actions injure their states by trafficking marijuana across borders. Colorado counters that federal guidance has allowed states to legalize marijuana, and the lawsuit is an attempt to overturn state policies. The case highlights the tension between federal prohibition and state legalization, with implications for the future of marijuana regulation nationwide. Proponents of legalization argue the lawsuit is wasteful and forces Colorado to defend its laws, while opponents claim it violates federal law and has broader consequences. The debate underscores the ongoing conflict between state autonomy and federal authority.
