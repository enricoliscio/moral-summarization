SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause as marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado's legalization has led to increased trafficking of marijuana across state lines, causing harm to neighboring states. Colorado's attorney general intends to defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the suit is without merit. Supporters of the lawsuit, such as anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argue that Colorado's legalization violates federal law. Meanwhile, critics argue that Nebraska and Oklahoma are overstepping their bounds and interfering with Colorado's rights to enact policies benefiting its citizens. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for state marijuana laws across the country.
