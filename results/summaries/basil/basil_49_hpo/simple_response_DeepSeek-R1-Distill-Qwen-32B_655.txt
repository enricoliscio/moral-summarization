Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado over marijuana legalization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, claiming Colorado's recreational marijuana laws are unconstitutional because federal law prohibits it. They're using the Supremacy Clause, which says federal law overrides state law. Colorado's attorney general is defending their state laws, saying the lawsuit lacks merit.

The article also mentions that several states have legalized marijuana, and it's been successful in Colorado since 2014. There's support from groups like the Marijuana Policy Project, who think the lawsuit is without merit. On the other side, anti-legalization groups like Smart Approaches to Marijuana support the lawsuit, arguing it violates federal law.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral perspectives. Nebraska and Oklahoma are framing it as Colorado breaking the law, while Colorado and supporters see it as states' rights and the federal government not enforcing its own laws. Also, the potential impact on the industry if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado.

I should keep the summary under 200 words and end with the tokens. Let me structure it: start with the lawsuit, the constitutional argument, Colorado's response, the implications, and the differing opinions. Make sure each point is concise and captures the moral arguments from both sides.

I think I've got all the key points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution under the Supremacy Clause, as federal law prohibits marijuana. Colorado's attorney general defends the state's laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit and that neighboring states' concerns stem from federal non-enforcement rather than Colorado's policy. The lawsuit highlights tensions between state sovereignty and federal law, with supporters of Colorado's laws arguing that states should have the right to decide their own policies. Critics, including anti-legalization groups, argue that Colorado's actions violate federal law and harm neighboring states. The outcome could impact the legality of marijuana across the U.S., as a Supreme Court ruling in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma could invalidate state marijuana laws. Proponents of legalization, like the Marijuana Policy Project, dismiss the lawsuit as meritless, calling it an overreach by Nebraska and Oklahoma. END OF SUMMARY.
