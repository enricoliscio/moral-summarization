SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional and undermines the US Constitution. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers vows to vigorously defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the suit "without merit". The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization is illegal under federal law, and that the illegal products are being trafficked across state lines, injuring neighboring states. Proponents of marijuana legalization, such as Rep. Jared Polis, call the lawsuit "outrageous" and an attempt to interfere with Colorado's right to enact policies that benefit its citizens. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching consequences for the legalization of marijuana in other states. END OF SUMMARY.
