SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. The states argue that the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution gives federal law precedence over state law, and since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Colorado's legalization is invalid. Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, plans to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the lawsuit "without merit". Supporters of marijuana legalization, including Rep. Jared Polis, have criticized the lawsuit, calling it an attempt to overturn the will of Colorado's voters and an attack on states' rights. The outcome of the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially putting all state marijuana laws in jeopardy. The lawsuit highlights the tension between state and federal laws on marijuana, and the need for Congress to act on federal marijuana policy.
