SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the constitutionality of its recreational marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado has *undermined* the U.S. Constitution by legalizing marijuana, which remains *illegal* under federal law. The lawsuit claims that the Supremacy Clause gives precedence to federal law, and that Colorado's legalization injures neighboring states through the trafficking of *illegal* marijuana. Colorado's attorney general intends to *vigorously* defend the state's marijuana laws, stating that the lawsuit is *without merit*. In contrast, marijuana advocates criticize Nebraska and Oklahoma for attempting to interfere with Colorado's policies, calling their actions "bullying" and claiming that they are on the *wrong side of history*. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for state marijuana laws nationwide, with some fearing a potential unraveling of progress made towards legalization.
END OF SUMMARY.
