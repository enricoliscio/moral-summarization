SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who called it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal would restore Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 300,000 people and allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Democrats insist they will not negotiate with Trump over border security until the government reopens. The proposal is seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but it has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans, who view it as amnesty.

END OF SUMMARY.
