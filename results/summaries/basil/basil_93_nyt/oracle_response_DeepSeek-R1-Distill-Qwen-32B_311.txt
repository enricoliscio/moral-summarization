Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about President Trump offering a deal during the government shutdown, and the moral terms are important. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

First, the shutdown is a major issue, and Trump is offering temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for border wall funding. The author uses words like "hostage," "protections," "revoked," "crisis," "shutdown," "compromise," and others that carry moral weight. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by outlining the main events: Trump's offer, the rejection by Democrats, the context of the shutdown, the previous actions like revoking DACA and TPS, and the reactions from both parties. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the specified moral terms as possible.

I'll structure the summary to mention Trump's proposal, the Democratic response, the context of previous policies, and the ongoing stalemate. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by using words like "hostage," "protections," "shutdown," "crisis," etc.

Let me draft a version and then check the word count and the inclusion of the moral terms. I should ensure that each key point is covered without going over the word limit. Also, the summary needs to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start after "SUMMARY:".

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown, providing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democrats rejected the proposal, calling it "hostage-taking" and a "nonstarter" since it didn't offer permanent protections. Trump's plan aimed to "break the logjam" but faced criticism from both parties. Democrats accused him of raising false hopes, while some conservatives labeled it amnesty. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has led to growing public backlash against Trump, with polls showing most blame him. Trump's proposal followed weeks of political stalemate, including a grounded plane incident involving Nancy Pelosi. His offer included humanitarian assistance and new border agents but failed to secure Democratic support, as they demanded the government reopen before negotiations. The impasse continued, with McConnell considering legislation and Trump threatening a national emergency declaration. END OF SUMMARY.
