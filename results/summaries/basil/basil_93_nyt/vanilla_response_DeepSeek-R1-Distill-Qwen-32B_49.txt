Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump's proposal during the government shutdown. He offered a deal to Democrats: temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. But the Democrats rejected it, calling it hostage-taking. The shutdown is in its fifth week, and public opinion is against Trump.

I should note that Trump's proposal includes restoring TPS for 300,000 and extending DACA for 700,000 for three more years. He also mentioned humanitarian aid and new border agents. Pelosi and Schumer rejected it, saying it's not a compromise. Some on the right criticized it as amnesty. Trump's advisers tried to pressure Democrats, and the shutdown is affecting federal employees' pay.

The article also mentions that Trump's proposal didn't offer permanent protections, which is a big issue for Democrats. They want a more generous solution. The shutdown is causing anxiety among Republicans up for re-election, like Susan Collins, who supports reopening without a deal. Trump's offer might shift blame onto Democrats, but they remain skeptical because of past failed negotiations.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting Trump's proposal, the Democrats' rejection, the reasons behind it, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include key points like temporary protections, funding for the wall, Democratic criticism, and the ongoing shutdown's impact.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump proposed a deal to end the government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democrats rejected the plan, calling it "hostage-taking" and insisting on permanent protections for Dreamers. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has led to public backlash against Trump. His proposal included $800 million for humanitarian aid, new border agents, and immigration judges, but Democrats criticized it as insufficient and nonpermanent. Trump softened his tone, using "barrier" instead of "wall," and emphasized legal immigration. Pelosi and Schumer dismissed the plan, with Democrats vowing not to negotiate until the government reopens. The proposal failed to bridge the divide, with some on the right labeling it amnesty. Trump's aides aimed to shift blame to Democrats, but skepticism remains due to past failed negotiations. The shutdown continues to impact federal employees and create political tension. END OF SUMMARY.
