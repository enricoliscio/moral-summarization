SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a deal to end the partial government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. The deal was rejected by Democratic leaders, who criticized it as insufficient and disingenuous. The proposal was the president's first public offer to Democrats since the shutdown began and came after a week of acrimonious political maneuvering. The president's proposal included border security measures and a softening of his tone on immigration, but Democrats remained steadfast in their refusal to negotiate on border security until the government reopens. The deal also faced criticism from some on the right, who described it as amnesty. White House aides and allies of the president believed the proposal shifted the political pressure onto Democrats, but Democrats remained wary due to past failed negotiations with the president. The shutdown stalemate is causing increasing concern among Republicans, particularly those seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states.
END OF SUMMARY.
