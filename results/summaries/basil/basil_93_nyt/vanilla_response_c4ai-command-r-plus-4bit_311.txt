SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to Democrats on Saturday to temporarily protect some undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for his border wall, but the offer was rejected by Democratic leaders. The proposal, which comes amid a partial government shutdown, included protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients, but no pathway to citizenship. Vice President Pence defended the plan, saying there was no amnesty for undocumented immigrants. The proposal is part of an effort to shift blame for the shutdown onto Democrats and put pressure on them to negotiate. However, Democrats criticized the deal as insufficient and noted that the protections offered were revoked by Trump himself. The shutdown has created increasing tension on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans breaking with the President and calling for an end to the impasse. Trump's proposal may ratchet up pressure on Democrats, but they remain wary of the deal due to past negotiations falling apart.
