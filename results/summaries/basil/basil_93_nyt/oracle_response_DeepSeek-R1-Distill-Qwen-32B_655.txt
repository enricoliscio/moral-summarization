Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article to understand the main points.

President Trump offered a deal to Democrats during the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for border wall funding. Pelosi and Schumer rejected it, calling it hostage-taking. The shutdown is in its fifth week, with public blame on Trump. Trump's advisors were looking for an exit strategy. The proposal included $5.7 billion for a border barrier, humanitarian assistance, and more border agents. Democrats criticized it as a nonstarter, wanting permanent protections. Some Republicans, like Susan Collins, want the shutdown to end without a border deal. Trump's proposal was seen as a compromise but faced criticism from both sides. The shutdown is causing political pressure, and Trump's options include declaring a national emergency.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary using as many of the provided moral words as possible. I'll structure it to include the key elements: the shutdown, Trump's offer, Democratic rejection, the crisis, assistance, and the ongoing impasse. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing words like shutdown, hostage, protections, crisis, assistance, nonstarter, and impasse.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump offered Democrats a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. However, the proposal was rejected as a "hostage-taking" scheme. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has seen public blame on Trump, with Democrats refusing to negotiate until the government reopens. Trump's plan, which included humanitarian assistance and more border agents, was criticized as a "nonstarter" for lacking permanent protections for Dreamers. Democrats accused Trump of revoking protections he had previously granted, while some on the right labeled the deal amnesty, arguing it undermines the rule of law. Trump's advisors sought to break the logjam, but the impasse continued, with Senate Democrats under pressure to decide whether to block or support the proposal. The shutdown crisis has heightened political tensions, with Trump attempting to shift blame onto Democrats, while some Republicans, like Susan Collins, advocate for reopening without a border deal. END OF SUMMARY.
