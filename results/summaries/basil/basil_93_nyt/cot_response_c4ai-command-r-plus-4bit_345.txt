SUMMARY: President Trump is facing a strong public backlash for the partial government shutdown. He offered a *proposal* to Democrats: temporary *protections* for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall at the southern border. However, this *deal* was rejected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it "hostage-taking". Polls show that a majority of the public *blames* Trump for the shutdown. The *intransigent* president has a record of attempting to curb both legal and illegal immigration, *revoking* crucial *protections* for immigrants. In his *proposal*, Trump offered to *restore* Temporary Protected Status for some immigrants and to extend *protections* for Dreamers in exchange for funding for a border *barrier*. Trump's tone has softened, and he has paired his *proposal* with a naturalization ceremony at the White House. However, critics from both sides have denounced the *deal*, with some calling it amnesty and others saying it does not offer permanent *protections*. The *desperation* of the president to end the shutdown is evident, but Democrats remain wary of his *deal*-making, given his history of backing away from agreements.
END OF SUMMARY.
