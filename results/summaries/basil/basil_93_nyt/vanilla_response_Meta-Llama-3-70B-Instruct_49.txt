SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who claim it's not a compromise but rather "hostage taking." The deal would restore protections for 300,000 people and allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Trump's proposal also includes funding for border security measures, such as drug detection technology and additional border agents. Despite the proposal, Democrats insist they will not negotiate with Trump over border security until the government reopens. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump for the impasse.

END OF SUMMARY.
