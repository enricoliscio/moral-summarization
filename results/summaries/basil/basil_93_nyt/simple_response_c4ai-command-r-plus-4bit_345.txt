SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to Democrats to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The proposal was rejected by Democratic leaders, who called it "hostage taking." The shutdown has entered its fifth week, and polls show a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, leading his advisers to search for an exit strategy. The proposal was Trump's first public offer to Democrats since the shutdown began and included funding for border agents, humanitarian assistance, and drug detection technology, in addition to the wall. Despite casting the plan as a compromise, Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate with Trump over border security until the government reopens. They criticized the deal for not offering permanent protections for Dreamers and for only providing temporary solutions. Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. Trump's strategy seemed to be to drive a wedge within the Democratic Party, but Democrats are wary of dealing with Trump due to past experiences. The shutdown has created increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states.
