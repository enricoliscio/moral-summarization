SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, Democrats have rejected the proposal, calling it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The plan is seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they insist they will not negotiate until the government reopens. The proposal has been criticized for offering only temporary protections and not providing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. Even some on the right have pushed back, calling it "amnesty." The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump. The proposal has been seen as a desperate attempt to end the stalemate, but Democrats are wary of negotiating with Trump after previous deals fell apart.
