SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who view it as "hostage taking" and not a genuine compromise. The deal would restore protections for 300,000 people and allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Democrats argue that the proposal does not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that Trump himself revoked the protections he is now offering to restore. The proposal has also been criticized by some on the right, who see it as amnesty. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump. The proposal is seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown.
