SUMMARY:

President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who deemed it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal would restore Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protection for 300,000 people and allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Democrats insisted they would not negotiate with Trump over border security until the government reopens, citing his history of revoked protections and broken promises. The proposal was seen as a nonstarter, with many Democrats considering it unacceptable due to its lack of permanent protections for Dreamers. The standoff continues, with the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
