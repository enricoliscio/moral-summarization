SUMMARY: President Trump, facing backlash for the government shutdown, proposed a deal to Democrats: protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall at the southern border. The deal, which included border security measures and humanitarian assistance, was rejected by Democratic leaders. They viewed it as a nonstarter and accused the president of taking hostages. The proposal was part of an exit strategy devised by Trump's advisers as polls showed the public blamed him for the shutdown. Trump's offer was his first public attempt at compromise with Democrats since the shutdown began, and it aimed to shift the pressure onto them to end the impasse. Despite the president's efforts, Democrats remained steadfast in their refusal to negotiate border security until the government reopens. The article highlights the moral dimensions of the debate, such as Trump's revocation of protections for immigrants and the Democrats' insistence on providing assistance and a pathway to citizenship. The shutdown has caused a crisis, and the president's proposal was an attempt to break the logjam. However, with Democrats wary of past deals falling through, it remains to be seen if this proposal will lead to an end to the shutdown impasse.
END OF SUMMARY.
