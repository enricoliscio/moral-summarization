Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Then, I need to summarize the article while preserving those moral terms.

Looking at the article, I see words like "backlash," "blame," "hostage taking," "compromise," "fair," "reasonable," "common sense," "crisis," "protections," "shutdown," "desperation," "fake promises," "false hopes," "amnesty," "undermine," "citizenship," "pressure," "desperation," "shutdown," "leery," "deal," "unconstitutional," "cynical," "opportunity," "nervousness," "impasse," "dead on arrival," "public backlash," "blame," "hostage taking," "compromise," "fair," "reasonable," "common sense," "protections," "shutdown," "desperation," "fake promises," "false hopes," "amnesty," "undermine," "citizenship," "pressure," "desperation," "leery," "deal," "unconstitutional," "cynical," "opportunity," "nervousness," "impasse," "dead on arrival."

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, incorporating as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's offer, the Democrats' rejection, the shutdown's impact, and the political strategies involved. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the author's perspective.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive. I'll start by outlining Trump's proposal, the immediate rejection, the reasons behind it, and the ongoing stalemate. I'll also mention the political pressure and the implications for both parties.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content while preserving the moral framing. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and adjust as necessary.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump offered Democrats a deal to provide temporary protections for 700,000 undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, but the proposal was rejected as "hostage taking." The partial government shutdown, now in its fifth week, has caused public backlash, with polls showing blame on Trump. His advisers sought an exit strategy, leading to the proposal, which Trump framed as a "fair, reasonable, and common sense" compromise. However, Democrats refused to negotiate until the government reopens, criticizing the deal as insufficient and temporary. Trump's offer to restore Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and extend DACA protections was seen as "fake promises" and "false hopes." Some on the right criticized it as "amnesty," while Trump's allies defended it as a necessary step to break the "impasse." The shutdown has created political pressure, with Democrats vowing to reject the deal and Republicans facing nervousness ahead of elections. The stalemate continues, with Trump threatening to declare a national emergency if no agreement is reached. END OF SUMMARY.
