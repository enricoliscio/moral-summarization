SUMMARY:
President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who called it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The president's plan was seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they insisted they would not negotiate over border security until the government reopens. The proposal was criticized for being "fake" and "unacceptable" as it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers. The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. The president's offer was seen as an attempt to drive a wedge within the party and create an opening for negotiations.
END OF SUMMARY.
