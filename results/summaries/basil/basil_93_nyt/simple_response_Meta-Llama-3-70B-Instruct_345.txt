SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was met with criticism from Democrats, who rejected it as "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The plan was seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they refused to negotiate over border security until the government reopens. The proposal was also criticized by some on the right, who described it as amnesty. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump for the impasse. The proposal's fate now lies with Senate Democrats, who must decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote.

END OF SUMMARY.
