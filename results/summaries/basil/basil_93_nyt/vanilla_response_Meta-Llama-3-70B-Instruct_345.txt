SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who called it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal would restore Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 300,000 people and allow Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Trump's proposal also includes funding for border security, humanitarian assistance, and drug detection technology. Democrats criticized the plan, saying it does not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that Trump himself revoked the protections he is now offering to restore. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump. The proposal is seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown.
