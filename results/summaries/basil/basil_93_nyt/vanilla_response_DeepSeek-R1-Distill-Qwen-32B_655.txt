Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump offering a deal to end the government shutdown. He's proposing temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding a border wall. The Democrats are rejecting this deal, calling it hostage-taking. The shutdown is in its fifth week, and public opinion is against Trump. His advisors are trying to find a way out, and this proposal is their latest attempt.

I should note the key elements: the deal's specifics, the reactions from Pelosi and Schumer, the context of the shutdown, and the political dynamics. Also, Trump's previous actions on immigration, like revoking TPS and DACA, are relevant. The proposal includes $5.7 billion for the wall, restoring TPS for 300,000, and extending DACA protections for three years. Democrats are upset because it's temporary and don't want to negotiate until the government reopens.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's offer, the Democrats' rejection, the context of the shutdown, and the implications of the deal. I'll mention the key points without getting too detailed, ensuring it's clear and captures the essence of the article.

Wait, the user mentioned using a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I should structure it accordingly. Also, the summary should be in English, as the article is in English.

Let me make sure I include the main points: the offer, the rejection, the political pressure, the specifics of the deal, and the reactions. I should avoid including too much background unless it's essential. Maybe mention that this is Trump's first public offer since the shutdown began.

I think I have a good grasp now. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing $5.7 billion for a border wall in exchange for temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants and 300,000 TPS recipients. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who called it "hostage-taking" and insisted on reopening the government before negotiations. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has sparked public backlash against Trump, with his advisors seeking an exit strategy. Trump's plan, which includes funding for border agents and humanitarian aid, was criticized for offering only temporary protections and no pathway to citizenship. Democrats, including Pelosi and Schumer, rejected the deal, while some on the right accused it of being amnesty. Trump's offer comes after months of political tension and failed negotiations, with the shutdown creating growing pressure on Capitol Hill. END OF SUMMARY.
