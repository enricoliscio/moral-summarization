SUMMARY: President Trump is facing a moral dilemma as the partial government shutdown enters its fifth week, with polls showing the public blaming him for the crisis. In a bid to break the logjam, Trump offered Democrats temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for his border wall. However, his proposal was rejected by Democratic leaders as hostage-taking, with Democrats refusing to negotiate on border security until the government reopens. Trump's offer includes restoring protections for immigrants and a three-year extension for Dreamers, in exchange for funding for a steel barrier along the southern border. The proposal is intended to provide a compromise and shift the pressure onto Democrats. Meanwhile, the shutdown is creating increasing nervousness, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. Trump's strategy seems to be to ratchet up political pressure on Democrats, but they remain leery of any deal, having been let down by the president before. The situation has forced Trump into high-stakes negotiations, but some see it as a desperate move.
