Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be under 200 words and placed between "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown by providing temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for border wall funding. Democrats rejected it, calling it a nonstarter and criticized for not offering permanent protections. There's also mention of the shutdown's impact, political pressure, and the possibility of a national emergency declaration.

I need to highlight the moral elements. Words like shutdown, hostage, revoked, protections, crisis, compromise, nonstarter, credible, trafficking, undermine, etc., are key. I should structure the summary to include these words while keeping it concise.

I'll start by stating Trump's offer, then the Democratic response, the criticisms, and the political implications. I'll make sure to mention the morally charged terms to maintain the author's framing.

Let me draft it: Trump offered a deal during the shutdown, but Democrats rejected it as a nonstarter. He proposed temporary protections but no permanent solution, which was criticized. The shutdown's impact and political pressure are highlighted, along with the possibility of a national emergency. The summary should capture the moral aspects like the crisis, hostage situation, and lack of credibility in the proposal.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the key moral terms.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democrats rejected the plan, calling it a "nonstarter" and criticizing it for lacking permanent protections. Trump's proposal, which came after weeks of shutdown and public backlash, was seen as a compromise but faced strong opposition. Critics accused it of being "hostage taking" and "amnesty," while Democrats argued it undermined their priorities. The shutdown crisis, now in its fifth week, has created political pressure, with federal employees facing a second missed pay period. Trump's offer, which included humanitarian assistance and new border agents, was deemed insufficient by Democrats, who insisted on reopening the government first. The proposal, which Trump described as a "fair compromise," was met with skepticism, as it failed to address key concerns and risked raising false hopes. END OF SUMMARY.
