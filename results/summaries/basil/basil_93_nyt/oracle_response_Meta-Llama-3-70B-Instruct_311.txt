SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, Democrats have rejected the proposal, calling it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The president's plan would restore protections for 300,000 people and allow Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Democrats insist they will not negotiate over border security until the government reopens, and have criticized the proposal as a "nonstarter" that does not offer permanent protections for Dreamers. The president's offer has been met with skepticism, with some on the right calling it "amnesty" and others seeing it as an attempt to drive a wedge within the Democratic party. The standoff continues, with the government shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
