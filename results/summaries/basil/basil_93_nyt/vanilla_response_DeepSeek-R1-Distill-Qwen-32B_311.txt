Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump offering a deal to end the government shutdown. He's proposing temporary protections for DACA recipients and TPS holders in exchange for funding a border wall. 

He made this offer in a speech, but Democrats rejected it immediately. Pelosi and Schumer criticized it as not a compromise but more like hostage-taking. The shutdown is in its fifth week, and public opinion is against Trump. His advisors are looking for an exit strategy.

The deal includes $5.7 billion for the wall, restoring TPS for 300,000 and DACA for 700,000 for three more years. Trump tried to soften his tone, using "barrier" instead of "wall," and mentioned adopting some Democratic proposals. Pelosi and others have their own plans but still oppose the deal.

Democrats are upset because the protections aren't permanent and Trump had revoked them before. Some on the right see it as amnesty. Pence defended the proposal, saying no citizenship pathway. The deal might create a split among Democrats, especially with the deadline approaching for federal employees' next paycheck.

McConnell might bring the bill to the floor, but Democrats are likely to block it. Susan Collins, a Republican, supports reopening without the deal. Trump's move puts pressure on Pelosi, but Democrats are wary due to past failed negotiations.

So, the summary needs to capture Trump's offer, the immediate rejection, key points of the deal, reactions from both sides, and the potential for further negotiations. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants (Dreamers) and 300,000 Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. The proposal, presented in a White House speech, was rejected by Democrats, who called it "hostage-taking" and insufficient. The shutdown, in its fifth week, has seen public blame directed at Trump, prompting his administration to seek an exit strategy. The deal included funding for border agents, judges, and humanitarian aid, but Democrats criticized it for lacking permanent protections and accused Trump of reviving protections he had previously revoked. Some on the right labeled the plan as amnesty. Trump softened his tone, using "barrier" instead of "wall," and acknowledged Democratic proposals. Pelosi and Schumer rejected the offer, while Republicans like Susan Collins urged reopening without the deal. The proposal may create divisions among Democrats, with a deadline looming for federal employees' next paycheck. McConnell may bring the bill to the Senate floor, but Democrats are unlikely to support it, leaving the shutdown stalemate unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
