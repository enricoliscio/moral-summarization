Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

So, President Trump offered a deal to Democrats during the government shutdown: temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. But Democrats rejected it, calling it hostage-taking. Pelosi and Schumer were against it. Trump tried to shift blame onto Democrats, but they refused to negotiate until the shutdown ends.

The article mentions that Trump has been trying to reduce both legal and illegal immigration, revoking TPS and DACA. His proposal included humanitarian aid and more border agents. Democrats criticized it for not offering permanent protections and for being fake promises. Some on the right saw it as amnesty. McConnell might bring the bill to the floor, but Democrats are hesitant.

I need to capture the moral aspects: Trump's tough stance on immigration, Democrats' rejection, the political pressure, and the implications of the shutdown. Also, the criticism from both sides about the deal being inadequate or amnesty.

Now, I'll condense this into a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key moral points.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democrats rejected the plan, calling it "hostage-taking," and refused to negotiate until the shutdown ends. Trump sought to shift blame, but Democrats criticized the deal for lacking permanent protections and accused it of being insincere. Trump's proposal, which included humanitarian aid and more border agents, faced criticism from both sides, with some labeling it amnesty. McConnell may bring the bill to the Senate floor, but Democrats remain skeptical, viewing it as a political ploy. The shutdown continues to escalate tensions, with political pressure mounting as federal employees face another missed pay period. END OF SUMMARY.
