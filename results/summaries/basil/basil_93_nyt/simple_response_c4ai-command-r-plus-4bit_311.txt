SUMMARY: President Trump, facing backlash for the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The proposal was rejected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, who called it “hostage-taking.” The proposal reflected a strategy to shift blame for the shutdown onto Democrats and to drive a wedge within the party. The president has repeatedly sought to curb immigration and has revoked protections for immigrants. His proposal offered temporary protections in exchange for funding, but was criticized for not offering permanent solutions for Dreamers and for being insufficient. The White House defended the plan, saying it reflected input from lawmakers and was a fair compromise. The shutdown has created nervousness, especially among vulnerable Republicans. Trump's proposal increased pressure on Democrats, but they remain cautious due to past broken deals.
