Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump offering a deal to end the government shutdown by providing temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for border wall funding. Democrats are rejecting it, calling it hostage-taking and not a real compromise.

The author uses words like shutdown, hostage, revoked, protections, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the key moral points.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's offer, the rejection by Democrats, the context of the shutdown, the political pressure, and the implications of the deal. I'll need to mention the $5.7 billion for the wall, the temporary protections, and the criticism from both sides.

I should also note that the deal is a compromise but Democrats don't see it as such, and the potential for renewed stalemate. I'll make sure to include terms like "hostage," "protections," "shutdown," and "compromise."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's offer, the rejection, the moral framing terms, and the ongoing stalemate. Keeping it within 200 words and ensuring all key points are covered without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown, providing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. Democrats rejected the proposal, calling it "hostage-taking" and a "nonstarter," as it did not offer permanent protections. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has caused public backlash against Trump, with polls showing most blame him. Trump's advisers sought an exit strategy, leading to the proposal, which he framed as a "fair compromise." However, Democrats insisted they would not negotiate until the government reopened. Trump's offer included humanitarian assistance and border security measures, but critics accused it of encouraging illegal immigration and undermining the rule of law. Pence defended the plan, emphasizing no pathway to citizenship. The stalemate continued, with McConnell considering legislation and Democrats vowing to reject the deal. The shutdown crisis highlighted political polarization and the struggle to find a credible solution, with both sides accusing the other of responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
