SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to Democrats to temporarily protect 700,000 undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, but the offer was rejected by Democratic leaders. The proposal came as Trump's advisers searched for an exit strategy from the partial government shutdown, now in its fifth week. The speech marked Trump's first public offer to Democrats since the shutdown began and was aimed at shifting pressure onto Democrats to end the shutdown. Democrats criticized the proposal as insufficient and unacceptable, arguing that it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that Trump had revoked protections for immigrants in the past. Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. Despite the rejection, the proposal could create an opening for negotiations between the two parties. The shutdown stalemate is causing concern among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. White House aides and allies believe Trump succeeded in increasing pressure on Democrats, especially if the Senate passes a bill. However, Democrats remain cautious due to past experiences with Trump backing away from deals.
