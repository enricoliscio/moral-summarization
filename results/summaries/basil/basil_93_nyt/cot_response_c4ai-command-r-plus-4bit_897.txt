SUMMARY:
President Trump is facing a public backlash over the partial government shutdown and has offered Democrats a proposal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal has been rejected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and criticized by Democrats and some on the right as insufficient and unacceptable amnesty. Trump's proposal is seen as a strategy to shift pressure onto Democrats and drive a wedge within the party. The shutdown has created nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. Despite the proposal and growing pressure, Democrats remain leery of a deal, citing past experiences where similar agreements fell apart. The standoff highlights the challenges of negotiating under high-stakes and desperate circumstances. 

END OF SUMMARY.
