SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who called it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal would restore protections for 300,000 people and allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Trump also proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology. Democrats criticized the plan, saying it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that Trump had revoked the protections he was now offering to restore. The proposal has also been met with criticism from some on the right, who described it as amnesty.

END OF SUMMARY.
