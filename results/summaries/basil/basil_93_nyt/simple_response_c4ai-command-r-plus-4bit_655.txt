SUMMARY: President Trump attempted to shift blame for the partial government shutdown to Democrats by offering temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for his border wall. The proposal was rejected by Democratic leaders as inadequate and disingenuous, with some characterizing it as "hostage taking." The shutdown has entered its fifth week, and polls show a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump. The proposal reflects a search for an exit strategy by the President and his advisors, but it is unlikely to succeed as Democrats have refused to negotiate on border security until the government reopens. The proposal also faced criticism from some on the right, who characterized it as amnesty. The President's strategy seems to be to drive a wedge within the Democratic Party and increase pressure on Speaker Pelosi. However, Democrats are wary of negotiating with Mr. Trump due to past experiences where he backed away from deals. The shutdown stalemate is causing concern among Republicans, especially those seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states.
END OF SUMMARY.
