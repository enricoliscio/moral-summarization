SUMMARY: President Trump, amid a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted ground on Saturday and presented Democrats with a proposal: temporary protections for about 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in return for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal, which Trump announced in a 13-minute address from the White House, seemed doomed from the start, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting it even before Trump spoke and Senator Chuck Schumer denouncing it as “not a compromise but more hostage taking.” The proposal was Trump’s first public offer to Democrats since the shutdown began nearly a month ago, and it came after a bitter week of political maneuvering. In his address, Trump sought to shift the blame for the shutdown to Democrats, who have refused to fund his border wall. He offered a compromise, proposing to restore protections for undocumented immigrants, which he had previously revoked. Trump’s tone seemed softer than in previous addresses, and he highlighted his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, underscoring his support for legal immigration. The proposal, however, faced pushback from both sides. Critics on the right described it as amnesty, while Democrats deemed it unacceptable for not offering permanent protections for undocumented immigrants. The intransigent stance of Democrats raised concerns about driving a wedge within the party. Ultimately, the proposal may have reflected Trump’s desperation to score political points and end the shutdown, but it remained to be seen if it would lead to a breakthrough.
END OF SUMMARY.
