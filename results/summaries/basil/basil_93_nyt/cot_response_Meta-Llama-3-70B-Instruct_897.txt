SUMMARY:
President Trump, facing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who deemed it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal was seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they insisted they would not negotiate over border security until the government reopens. The proposal was criticized for being "fake" and "unacceptable" as it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers. The standoff continues, with the president's ability to declare a national emergency still on the table. END OF SUMMARY.
