SUMMARY:

President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who denounced it as "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The president's advisers have been searching for an exit strategy, but the deal was seen as a nonstarter by Democrats, who insisted they will not negotiate over border security until the government reopens. The proposal was criticized for extending protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that Trump himself revoked, and for not offering permanent protections for Dreamers. The standoff over the shutdown has created increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. The deal was seen as an attempt to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward, but Democrats remained leery of the deal, citing past experiences with Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
