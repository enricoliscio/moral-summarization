SUMMARY: President Trump, facing backlash for the government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall. The proposal appeared dead on arrival, with Democrats rejecting it as "hostage taking." The deal aimed to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they refused to negotiate until the government reopens. Trump's plan included restoring protections for immigrants and offering temporary protections for Dreamers in exchange for funding for a border barrier. The proposal was framed as a "compromise" to "break the logjam," but Democrats criticized it as insufficient and non-credible. Some on the right also pushed back, describing it as amnesty. Vice President Pence defended the plan, denying it offered a pathway to citizenship. The strategy aimed to drive a wedge within the Democratic Party, but Democrats remained wary due to past experiences with Trump. The shutdown has created increasing nervousness, especially among vulnerable Republicans. Trump's offer was seen as a way to shift blame to Democrats, but they remained cautious due to the president's past negotiating tactics.
