SUMMARY:

President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who denounced it as "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The president's advisers have been searching for an exit strategy as the shutdown enters its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump. Democrats insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens, citing his history of revoking protections for immigrants and rescinding DACA. The proposal was seen as a nonstarter, with critics arguing it was a fake promise raising false hopes for Dreamers. The standoff has created increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. The shutdown stalemate has led to a crisis, with both sides dug in and no end in sight.

END OF SUMMARY.
