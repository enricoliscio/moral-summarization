SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a deal to Democrats on Saturday to temporarily protect some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. The proposal was rejected by Democratic leaders, who continue to refuse to negotiate on border security until the government reopens. The proposal was the president's first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began and came after a week of political feuding between Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In his address, Trump offered a compromise that included restoring Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 immigrants and allowing 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three years. Democrats criticized the deal as insufficient and noted that it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers. Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. Despite the rejection, the proposal may create an opening for negotiations between the two parties as the shutdown continues into its fifth week. The proposal reflects Trump's shift in strategy as polls show a majority of the public blaming him for the shutdown.
