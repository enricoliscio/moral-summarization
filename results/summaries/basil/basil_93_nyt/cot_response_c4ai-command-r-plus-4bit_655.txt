SUMMARY: President Trump, facing a growing public *backlash* over the partial government shutdown, shifted course and offered Democrats a *deal*: temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The *proposal*, which Trump unveiled in an address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting it even before Trump spoke. In his *proposal*, Trump offered to restore protections for undocumented immigrants and extend protections for Dreamers in exchange for funding for a border *barrier*. He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, seeking to *underscore* his support for legal immigration. Trump's language was also markedly different, as he referred to a "see-through steel *barrier*" rather than a concrete wall. The *proposal* reflected a shift in strategy, as Trump sought to shift the blame for the shutdown onto Democrats and end their *intransigence*. The White House also hoped to ratchet up political pressure on Pelosi, especially if the Senate passed a bill based on Trump's *proposal*. However, Democrats were skeptical of the *deal*, citing the president's previous *intransigence* and the lack of permanent protections for Dreamers. The *proposal* also faced criticism from some on the right, who described it as *amnesty*. Despite the *proposal*, the shutdown stalemate continued, creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill.
END OF SUMMARY.
