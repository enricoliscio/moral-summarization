SUMMARY: President Trump, amid a mounting public backlash over the partial government shutdown, presented a *proposal* to Democrats: temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for his border wall. However, the *rejection* was swift, with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer denouncing it as *hostage*-taking. Despite the *pressure*, Democrats maintained their *refusal* to negotiate until the government reopens. The *deal* offered protections that Trump himself had previously *curbed* or *revoked*, such as TPS and DACA. Critics called it *intransigence*, offering only temporary protections with no pathway to citizenship. Some on the right also pushed back, calling it amnesty. Trump's strategy seemed to be ratcheting up pressure on Democrats, but they remained wary due to past broken *proposals*. The *intransigence* has created nervousness, especially among vulnerable Republicans. The ball is now in the Senate's court to pass legislation, with the shutdown's effects intensifying.
END OF SUMMARY.
