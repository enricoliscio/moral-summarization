SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was met with rejection from Democrats, who called it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal would restore protections for 300,000 people and allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Trump also proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology. Democrats criticized the plan, saying it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that Trump was trying to drive a wedge within the party. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
