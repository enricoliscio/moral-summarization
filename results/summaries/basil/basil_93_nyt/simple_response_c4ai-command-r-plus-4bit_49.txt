SUMMARY: President Trump shifted his stance on Saturday in the face of mounting public opposition to the partial government shutdown, offering Democrats temporary protection for undocumented immigrants in exchange for wall funding. However, the proposal was rejected by Democratic leaders, who refused to negotiate on border security until the government reopens. The offer was criticized by both Democrats and some on the right, with the former citing the lack of permanent protections for Dreamers and the latter denouncing it as amnesty. Despite this, the proposal may increase pressure on Democrats as the shutdown enters its fifth week, with polls showing the public largely blames Trump. The strategy seems to be aimed at creating divisions within the Democratic Party. The shutdown has placed Republicans in a difficult position, with some breaking with the President to call for an end to the shutdown. Trump's proposal may be a last-ditch effort to shift blame and create a path forward, but it remains to be seen if it will lead to negotiations.
END OF SUMMARY.
