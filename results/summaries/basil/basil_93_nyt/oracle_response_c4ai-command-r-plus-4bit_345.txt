SUMMARY: President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The proposal, which grew out of talks between Vice President Pence and lawmakers, was Trump's first public offer to Democrats since the shutdown began. In his address, Trump sought to cast the plan as a compromise that would break the logjam and provide a path forward. He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, softening his tone on immigration and emphasizing legal immigration. The proposal included funding for border security, humanitarian assistance, and drug detection technology, as well as protections for Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients. However, Democrats rejected the deal, criticizing it as insufficient and non-credible. They argued that it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that Trump was responsible for revoking protections in the first place. The proposal also faced criticism from some on the right, who described it as amnesty. Despite the rejection, the offer ratcheted up pressure on Democrats, particularly if the Senate passes a bill. Now, it will be up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put legislation incorporating Trump's proposal on the floor.
END OF SUMMARY.
