SUMMARY: President Trump, facing a public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The proposal appeared to be rejected by Democratic leaders before it was even officially presented. The shutdown, now entering its fifth week, has led to a search for an exit strategy by the president's advisers. Trump's proposal included protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients, as well as funding for border security and humanitarian assistance. However, it was criticized by both Democrats and some on the right, who described it as amnesty. Despite the proposal, Democrats continue to insist that they will not negotiate with Trump over border security until the government reopens, and the shutdown impasse continues. The offer was seen as a last-resort attempt by Trump to negotiate his way out of a crisis, and it remains to be seen if it will lead to an end to the impasse.
