SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a deal to end the partial government shutdown, offering temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, Democrats have rejected the proposal, calling it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The plan would restore protections for 300,000 people and allow Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years. Trump's proposal is seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they insist they will not negotiate until the government reopens. The proposal has been met with criticism from both sides, with some calling it "amnesty" and others saying it does not offer permanent protections for Dreamers. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump. The president's advisers have been searching for an exit strategy, but the proposal has been deemed a nonstarter.

END OF SUMMARY.
