Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about President Trump offering a deal to Democrats during the government shutdown. He's proposing temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. The Democrats are rejecting the offer, calling it hostage-taking. The shutdown is in its fifth week, and public opinion is against Trump. His advisors are trying to find a way out, and this deal is their latest attempt.

I notice that the article talks about Trump's history of revoking protections for immigrants, which is a moral point against him. The Democrats are criticizing the deal because it doesn't offer permanent protections and because Trump is trying to use it as a political tool. Some on the right also criticize it as amnesty, which is another moral angle.

The article also mentions that the shutdown is causing problems for federal employees and that the deadline is approaching for the next pay period. There's mention of the possibility of a national emergency declaration if the legislative route doesn't work, which adds to the tension.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral aspects: Trump's attempt to shift blame, the temporary nature of the protections, the lack of a permanent solution, and the political pressure on Democrats. Also, the fact that this isn't the first time such a deal has been proposed and failed adds context to the credibility of the offer.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the key points without losing the moral framing. I'll need to highlight the political maneuvering, the criticism from both sides, and the implications for the shutdown and immigration policies.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. The proposal, criticized as "hostage-taking," was rejected by Democrats, who demanded permanent protections and refused to negotiate until the government reopened. Trump's deal, which he framed as a compromise, included funding for border agents, judges, and humanitarian aid, but Democrats accused it of being a political ploy, as Trump had previously revoked these protections. Some conservatives labeled the plan amnesty, while Trump's allies argued it shifted blame to Democrats. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has sparked political pressure, with Trump's advisors seeking an exit strategy amid public backlash. The proposal, which Trump described as "fair and reasonable," failed to bridge the divide, with Democrats insisting on a more generous solution. The stalemate highlights Trump's struggle with high-stakes negotiations, as the shutdown approaches its second pay period deadline, creating unease on Capitol Hill. END OF SUMMARY.
