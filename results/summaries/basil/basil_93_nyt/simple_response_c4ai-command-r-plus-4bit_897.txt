SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to Democrats to end the partial government shutdown: temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The proposal appeared to be rejected by Democratic leaders, who criticized it as insufficient and claimed it offered no permanent solutions for Dreamers. The proposal reflected a shift in strategy by Trump's advisers and was an attempt to shift pressure onto Democrats. However, Democrats remained steadfast in their refusal to negotiate on border security until the government reopens. The proposal also faced criticism from some on the right, who described it as amnesty. Despite the rejection, the proposal may create an opportunity for negotiations between the two parties. The shutdown has caused increasing unease among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. Trump's offer was seen as an attempt to shift blame onto Democrats and gain political leverage. However, Democrats remain cautious due to past experiences with Trump backing away from deals.
END OF SUMMARY.
