Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about the government shutdown, President Trump offering a deal, backlash, public blame, shutdown entering its fifth week. Words like "backlash," "blame," "shutdown," "deal," "protections," "border wall," "compromise," "hostage taking," "exit strategy," "acrimonious," "tit-for-tat," "public pressure," "immigration," "curb," "revoked," "Temporary Protected Status," "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals," "Dreamers," "deportation," "compromise," "common sense," "logjam," "pressure," "naturalization," "humanitarian assistance," "scanning technology," "vacancies," "citizenship," "amnesty," "incentivizes," "undermine," "rule of law," "public reassurance," "impasse," "nervousness," "re-election," "break with," "solely responsible," "leery," "negotiations," "desperation."

Now, I need to write a concise summary using these terms. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's offer, the rejection by Democrats, the context of the shutdown, the moral implications like blame, compromise, amnesty, and the political strategies involved. I should keep it under 200 words and include as many moral terms as possible without making it too long.

**SUMMARY:**
President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing $5.7 billion for a border barrier in exchange for temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients. However, Democrats rejected the plan, calling it "hostage taking" and insisting on permanent protections. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has led to public blame on Trump. His proposal, seen as a compromise, faced criticism from both parties, with Democrats accusing it of being insufficient and Republicans labeling it amnesty. Trump softened his tone, emphasizing a "steel barrier" instead of a wall, and included humanitarian aid and border agents. Pelosi criticized the deal as fake promises, while Pence defended it, stating no citizenship pathway was offered. The stalemate continues, with political pressure mounting as the shutdown impacts federal employees. McConnell may bring the bill to the floor, forcing Democrats to decide. The impasse highlights Trump's negotiation strategy, with some allies suggesting it shifts blame onto Democrats. END OF SUMMARY.
