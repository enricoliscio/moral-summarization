SUMMARY:
President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a "compromise" deal: temporary protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, Democrats rejected the proposal, calling it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The plan was met with criticism from both sides, with some calling it "amnesty" and others saying it was "unacceptable" because it didn't offer permanent protections for Dreamers. The proposal was seen as a attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they insisted they wouldn't negotiate until the government reopens. The standoff has created increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. END OF SUMMARY.
