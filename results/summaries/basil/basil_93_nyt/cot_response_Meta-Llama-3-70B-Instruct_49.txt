SUMMARY:
President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. However, the proposal was met with criticism from Democrats, who called it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal was seen as a attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they refused to negotiate over border security until the government reopens. The proposal was also criticized for being a "fake" promise that would "undermine" confidence in the rule of law. The shutdown has entered its fifth week, with polls showing a majority of the public blaming Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
