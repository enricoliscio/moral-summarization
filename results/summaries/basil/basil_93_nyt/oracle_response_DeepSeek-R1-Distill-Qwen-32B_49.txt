Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump offering a deal to Democrats during the government shutdown. He's proposing temporary protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for border wall funding. Democrats are rejecting the deal, calling it hostage-taking and not a real compromise. There's a lot of political maneuvering, with Trump trying to shift the blame onto Democrats, and the shutdown affecting public opinion against him.

The author uses several morally charged words like "shutdown," "hostage," "revoked," "protections," "rescind," "shielded," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the moral framing.

I'll start by identifying the key events: Trump's offer, the rejection by Pelosi and Schumer, the shutdown's impact, and the political strategies involved. I should mention the temporary protections, the funding for the wall, and the Democrats' criticisms. Also, note the previous failed negotiations and the pressure on both sides.

I need to ensure that the morally framed words are used naturally in the summary. For example, using "shutdown," "hostage," "protections," "rescind," "crisis," etc. I should structure the summary to show Trump's offer, the rejection, the reasons behind it, and the implications for both parties.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY:  
President Trump offered a deal to Democrats during the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 Dreamers and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who criticized it as "hostage taking" and a "nonstarter" due to its lack of permanent protections for Dreamers. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has seen public blame shifting toward Trump, prompting his advisers to seek an exit strategy. Trump's plan, which included humanitarian assistance and drug detection technology, aimed to "break the logjam" and shift pressure to Democrats, who refuse to negotiate until the government reopens. Democrats accused Trump of revoking protections he had previously granted and questioned the credibility of his offer. Some on the right criticized the proposal as amnesty, while Trump's team denied any pathway to citizenship. The standoff, which has created political pressure, especially for Republicans in Democratic-leaning states, remains unresolved as McConnell prepares to bring legislation to the Senate floor. Democrats, wary of past failed negotiations, remain united in rejecting the deal, framing it as insufficient and raising false hopes. The shutdown crisis continues to deepen, with federal employees facing a second pay period without pay. END OF SUMMARY.
