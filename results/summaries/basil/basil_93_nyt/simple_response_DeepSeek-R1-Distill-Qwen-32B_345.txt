Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump offering a deal to end the government shutdown by providing temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding a border wall. The Democrats rejected the deal, calling it insufficient and not a real compromise. Trump's proposal included restoring some protections but didn't offer permanent solutions, which upset Democrats. Some on the right criticized it as amnesty. The shutdown is causing political pressure, especially on Republicans in Democratic-leaning states.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the criticism of Trump's offer as not being a real compromise and the political pressure on both sides. Also, mention the Democrats' rejection and the temporary nature of the protections.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key elements: Trump's offer, the rejection by Democrats, the temporary protections, the criticism from both sides, and the political implications of the shutdown.

Let me structure the summary step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump offered a deal to end the government shutdown, proposing temporary protections for 700,000 undocumented young immigrants (Dreamers) and 300,000 TPS recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democrats rejected the plan, calling it insufficient and a "hostage-taking" tactic, as it didn't provide permanent protections for Dreamers. Trump's proposal, which included humanitarian aid and border security measures, was criticized by some on the right as amnesty, while Democrats accused him of revoking protections he had previously granted. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has caused political pressure, with Republicans in Democratic-leaning states growing nervous. Trump's advisers sought to shift blame to Democrats, but public opinion largely blames Trump. The deal, which McConnell deemed a "fair compromise," faces strong opposition, leaving the shutdown stalemate unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
