SUMMARY:
President Trump, facing growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. However, the proposal was rejected by Democrats, who deemed it "not a compromise but more hostage taking." The deal was seen as an attempt to shift pressure to Democrats to end the shutdown, but they insisted they would not negotiate over border security until the government reopens. Critics on both sides, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, called the proposal "fake promises raising false hopes" and "amnesty." The standoff continues, with Democrats wary of the president's intentions, citing past broken promises. The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. END OF SUMMARY.
