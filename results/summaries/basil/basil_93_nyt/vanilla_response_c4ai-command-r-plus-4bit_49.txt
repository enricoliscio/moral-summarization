SUMMARY: President Trump offered Democrats a deal to end the partial government shutdown: temporary protections for undocumented immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall along the southern border. The proposal was rejected by Democratic leaders, who continue to refuse to fund the wall. Trump's offer included restoring Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 immigrants and allowing 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. The proposal also included additional funding for border security and humanitarian assistance. Democrats criticized the plan, saying it did not offer permanent protections for Dreamers and that the protections offered were ones that Trump himself revoked. Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. Despite the rejection, the proposal may create an opening for negotiations between the two parties as the shutdown enters its fifth week. White House aides and allies of Trump believe the proposal shifts the political pressure onto Democrats to end the shutdown. However, Democrats remain skeptical due to past negotiations with Trump that fell apart.
END OF SUMMARY.
