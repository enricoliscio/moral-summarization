Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump stepping down as a moderator for a Republican debate. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Trump announced he's bowing out as the moderator for the debate because most candidates didn't want to attend. He mentioned a potential conflict of interest if he runs as a third-party candidate next year. He's still considering an independent bid, especially if the economy stays bad and the Republicans choose a wrong candidate. He wants to keep his options open and still plans to endorse a Republican candidate.

The debate was technically sponsored by Newsmax, but Trump became the main face of it. Some candidates like Gingrich and Santorum agreed to attend, but others dropped out, probably worried about Trump's possible third-party run. Trump cited concerns from RNC chairman Reince Priebus and doesn't expect the debate to happen without him. He expressed confidence in the debate's success but decided to step back to avoid conflicts.

He also praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage in attending the debate. The main points are Trump stepping down, his possible third-party run, the candidates' concerns, and the potential cancellation of the debate.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Trump's decision, reasons, his consideration of an independent bid, the candidates' reactions, and the impact on the debate. I'll make sure to mention the conflict of interest and his endorsement plans.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump stepping down, his reason about conflict of interest, mention the third-party consideration, the candidates' concerns, the debate's sponsorship, and the outcome. Keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to stay within the word limit and include all essential elements.
