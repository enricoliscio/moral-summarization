SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open, ensuring the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to agree to the debate. Trump still plans to make an endorsement, but may run as an independent if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate. He believes the economy will continue to be bad, and wants to make sure America becomes "great again". Trump's decision was met with concerns from other Republican candidates, who feared he wouldn't rule out a third-party run. END OF SUMMARY.
