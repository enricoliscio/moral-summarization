SUMMARY: Donald Trump has bowed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate. This moral dilemma was brought about by his own doing, as most candidates opted not to attend the debate due to concerns over Trump's possible third-party candidacy. Despite his decision, Trump still plans to endorse a Republican candidate while keeping his options open for an independent bid. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their courage and confidence in agreeing to the debate despite the controversy. Trump's decision was influenced by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns, and he believes that the debate will not go ahead without him. Trump expressed confidence that the debate would have garnered great ratings and reiterated his desire to see America become great again.

END OF SUMMARY.
