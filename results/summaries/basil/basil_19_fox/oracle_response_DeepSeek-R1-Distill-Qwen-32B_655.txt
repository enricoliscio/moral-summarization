Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the author's moral perspective.

First, I'll read the article carefully. Trump is stepping down as a debate moderator because he might run as a third-party candidate. He wants to avoid a conflict of interest. The author uses words like "choose," "chosen," "defeat," "failed," "destructive," and "make." I need to include these in the summary.

I'll start by noting Trump's decision to bow out as moderator. He wants to keep his options open in case he runs independently. He criticizes the economy and the Republican choice, implying they might pick the wrong candidate. He still plans to endorse someone but remains undecided.

Next, I'll mention the candidates who left the debate and the concerns about Trump's potential third-party run. Trump cites Priebus's concerns and doubts the debate will happen without him. He's confident it would have been successful.

Finally, I'll include Trump's statement about choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat Obama and his goal to make America great again. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and use the specified moral words.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's decision, his reasons, the implications for the debate, and his broader goals. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing words without making the summary too verbose.

After drafting, I'll check the word count and ensure all key points are included while preserving the moral language. I'll also make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump has stepped down as the moderator for a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He emphasized the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat the "failed and destructive" Obama administration. Trump, who is still considering an independent bid, said he wants to keep his options open, especially if the economy remains poor and the Republicans select a candidate he deems unfit. While he plans to endorse a Republican, he stressed the need to avoid any perceived bias in the debate. Most candidates had already opted out of the debate, expressing concerns about Trump's potential third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their willingness to participate but doubted the debate would proceed without him. He expressed confidence in its success, highlighting his goal to "make America great again."  
END OF SUMMARY.
