SUMMARY: Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate scheduled for December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate in the 2012 election. Trump stated that he wants to keep his options open in case the Republicans choose a candidate he does not support and that he still plans to make an endorsement despite his potential independent bid. The real estate mogul and reality TV star had become the face of the debate, which was technically sponsored by Newsmax. Most Republican candidates opted not to attend the debate due to concerns about Trump's potential third-party candidacy and his previous flirtation with a Republican run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to the debate and expressed confidence that the debate would have garnered high ratings had he remained the moderator. Trump's decision was influenced by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns, and he does not expect Newsmax to proceed with the debate now that he has withdrawn.
END OF SUMMARY.
