SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate scheduled for December 27th, citing a potential "conflict of interest" due to his possible independent candidacy in the 2012 presidential election. Trump stated that he wanted to keep his options open and would consider an independent bid if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate and the economy remains poor. He also praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to participate in the debate, while most other Republican candidates opted out due to concerns over Trump's potential third-party run. Trump's decision came after Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus expressed concerns about his involvement. Trump stated that he still plans to endorse a Republican candidate and wants to ensure the party chooses the "right" one. 

END OF SUMMARY.
