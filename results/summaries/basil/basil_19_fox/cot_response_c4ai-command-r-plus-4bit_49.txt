SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has decided to bow out as the moderator of the upcoming Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" should he decide to run as an independent candidate. Trump wants to ensure Republicans choose the "right" candidate, but if they choose the "wrong" candidate, he may still enter the race as a third-party contender. Despite his decision, Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their "courage, conviction, and confidence" in agreeing to the debate. He also expressed confidence that the debate would have garnered "great ratings." Trump's decision comes after most candidates opted not to attend the debate due to concerns over his possible third-party candidacy and his refusal to rule it out definitively. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus also expressed concerns about Trump's involvement. Trump wants to keep his options open to ensure America becomes "great" again, even if it means running against the eventual Republican nominee.
END OF SUMMARY.
