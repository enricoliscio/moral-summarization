SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has decided not to moderate a Republican presidential debate scheduled for later this month, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure Republicans select the *right* candidate but is keeping his options open in case they choose the *wrong* one. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their *courage*, *conviction*, and *confidence* in agreeing to the debate. Trump's involvement raised concerns among candidates and the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus about his possible third-party ambitions. Despite his decision, Trump continues to flirt with the idea of an independent bid, citing the possibility of Republicans choosing the *wrong* candidate and the *bad* economy. Trump's trademark confidence remains, as he predicts the now uncertain debate would have garnered "great ratings." Trump's statement emphasizes his priority: making America *great* again, even if it means an independent run. END OF SUMMARY.
