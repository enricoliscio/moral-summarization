SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate scheduled for December 27th. Trump cited concerns about a "conflict of interest" as most candidates opted not to attend, and he wants to keep his options open for a possible third-party run. Trump stated that he still plans to endorse a Republican candidate but will consider an independent bid if the Republicans choose a candidate he believes is not "right." He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to the debate despite the controversy. Trump's involvement in the debate, sponsored by Newsmax, had sparked concerns among Republican candidates about his possible third-party ambitions. Trump's decision was influenced by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns, and he acknowledged the debate was unlikely to proceed without him. Trump expressed confidence that the debate would have drawn high ratings.
END OF SUMMARY.
