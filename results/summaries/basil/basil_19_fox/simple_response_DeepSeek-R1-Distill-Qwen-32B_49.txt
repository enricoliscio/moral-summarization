Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump bowing out as the moderator for a Republican debate. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Trump is stepping down as moderator because most candidates didn't want to attend, possibly due to concerns about his potential third-party run. He mentions a "conflict of interest" and wants to keep his options open. He's considering running as an independent if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate, especially if the economy stays bad. He still plans to endorse a Republican candidate but wants to maintain his independence. The debate was sponsored by Newsmax, but Trump was the main face of it. Some candidates like Gingrich and Santorum agreed to attend, but others dropped out. Trump cites Priebus's concerns and thinks the debate won't happen without him. He's confident in his influence and the potential ratings.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The author seems critical of Trump's self-interest and potential manipulation. The summary should reflect that Trump is prioritizing his own political future over the party's unity, which could create division. I should highlight his decision as self-serving and note the possible negative impact on the Republican efforts against Obama.

I'll structure the summary to mention Trump's withdrawal, his reasons, his consideration for a third-party run, the candidates' concerns, and the moral implication of his self-interest. Keep it under 200 words, clear and concise, ending with the moral critique.
