Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump stepping down as a debate moderator. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article says Trump is bowing out as the moderator for a Republican debate because most candidates didn't attend. He mentioned avoiding a conflict of interest if he runs as a third-party candidate next year. He's still considering an independent bid if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate and the economy stays bad. He also wants to ensure Republicans choose the right candidate and plans to endorse someone despite his possible third-party run. The debate was sponsored by Newsmax, but Trump was the face of it. Some candidates were concerned he might run as a third-party, so they didn't attend. Trump cited Reince Priebus' concerns and thinks the debate won't happen now. He's confident it would have done well. He praised Gingrich and Santorum for attending.

Now, the summary needs to capture all this concisely, under 200 words. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, which probably means highlighting Trump's decision as responsible to avoid conflicts and his commitment to making America great again. I should structure it to show his reasoning and the implications of his decision.

I'll start by stating Trump's decision to step down as moderator, mention the candidates' absence, his reason about conflict of interest, his consideration of a third-party run, and his endorsement plan. Then, I'll note the sponsorship by Newsmax, the candidates' concerns, Trump's confidence in the debate's success, and his praise for Gingrich and Santorum. Finally, I'll conclude with his goal of making America great again.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, each sentence building on the previous one, without losing the moral aspect. Let me draft it step by step, keeping an eye on the word count.
