Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Donald Trump stepping down as a debate moderator and asked for a summary that preserves the moral framing. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words in the article. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "bowing out," "conflict of interest," "wrong," "bad," "right," "failed," "destructive," "courage," "conviction," "confidence," and "great" stand out. These terms imply judgment or evaluation, so they're key for the moral framing.

Next, I need to summarize the article while keeping these words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's decision to step down, mention his reasoning about avoiding a conflict of interest, and his consideration of a third-party run. I'll include his comments on the economy and the Republican choice, as well as his endorsement plans. I'll also note the candidates who attended and those who didn't, and Trump's confidence in the debate's success. Finally, I'll wrap up with his support for Gingrich and Santorum.

I have to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the important points while preserving the moral language. I'll structure it to highlight Trump's strategic decision, his reasons, and the implications for the Republican Party and the upcoming election.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump announced he is bowing out as the moderator for a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He emphasized keeping his options open, particularly if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate or the economy remains "bad." Trump, a real estate mogul and reality TV star, stated he still plans to endorse a Republican candidate despite his consideration of an independent bid. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, lost traction as most candidates opted out, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum attending. Trump praised their "courage, conviction, and confidence" but expressed doubt the debate would proceed without him. He remained confident in its potential success, reiterating his goal to "make America great again."  
END OF SUMMARY.
