Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump stepping down as the moderator for a Republican debate. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used, specifically using words like choose, chosen, defeat, failed, destructive, and make. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is bowing out as moderator because most candidates aren't attending. He's doing this to avoid a conflict of interest if he runs as a third-party candidate next year. He's still considering an independent bid, especially if the economy stays bad and the Republicans pick the wrong candidate. He wants to ensure the right candidate is chosen to defeat Obama's administration, which he sees as failed and destructive. He also mentions that without him, the debate might not happen.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words. The key points are his decision to step down, his reasons involving conflict of interest, his consideration of a third-party run, his desire for the right candidate to be chosen, and his criticism of Obama's administration.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his decision, reasons, implications, and his comments about the debate. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include those specific words.

Let me draft it: Trump is stepping down as moderator to avoid conflict if he runs as an independent. He wants to ensure the right Republican is chosen to defeat Obama's failed, destructive administration. Despite this, he plans to endorse a candidate. Few candidates attended, and he doubts the debate will proceed without him.

Wait, I need to make sure I include all the morally framed words. "Choose," "chosen," "defeat," "failed," "destructive," and "make." I think I've covered them: "chosen," "defeat," "failed," "destructive." Maybe I can include "make" by saying he wants to make sure the right candidate is chosen. 

Let me check the word count. The summary I have is about 100 words, so I can add a bit more about his confidence in the debate's success and his endorsement plan. 

Putting it all together, the summary should mention his stepping down, reasons, implications, his consideration of a third-party run, the importance of choosing the right candidate, and his view of Obama's administration. I should also note that few candidates attended and his doubt about the debate proceeding without him.

I think that covers all the points and includes the necessary moral framing words. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
