SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced he will no longer moderate a Republican debate later this month, citing a desire to avoid a "conflict of interest" should he decide to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure Republicans choose the "right" candidate to defeat the "failed and destructive" Obama administration. While some candidates agreed to attend the debate, most opted out due to concerns over Trump's potential third-party bid. Trump praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage and confidence in agreeing to the debate. He expressed confidence that the debate would have garnered great ratings had he moderated. Trump's decision underscores his commitment to keeping his options open and ensuring America's greatness.
END OF SUMMARY.
