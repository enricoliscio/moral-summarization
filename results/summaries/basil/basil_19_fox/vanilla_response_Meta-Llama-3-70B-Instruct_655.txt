SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing concerns about a potential conflict of interest if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump stated that he wants to keep his options open and ensure that the Republican Party chooses the "right" candidate. He also expressed his desire to make an endorsement, despite considering an independent bid. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, had already seen most candidates opt out of attending, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to participate. Trump's decision was influenced by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement. Trump is still considering an independent run, citing the possibility of the Republicans choosing the wrong candidate and the continued poor state of the economy.

END OF SUMMARY.
