SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has decided to step down as moderator of the Republican presidential debate scheduled for later this month, citing concerns about a "conflict of interest" should he decide to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure Republicans select the *right* candidate, and he intends to endorse a candidate despite his potential independent bid. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, became associated with Trump when he was initially named as moderator. While Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum initially agreed to participate, other candidates declined due to Trump's possible third-party ambitions. Trump specifically mentioned RNC Chairman Reince Priebus' worries about his involvement. Trump praised Gingrich and Santorum for their *courage*, *conviction*, and *confidence* in agreeing to the debate. Trump believes the debate would have been successful and garnered high ratings. He reiterated his interest in an independent bid if Republicans choose the *wrong* candidate and the economy remains *bad*. Trump emphasized his priority is to "make America great again."
END OF SUMMARY.
