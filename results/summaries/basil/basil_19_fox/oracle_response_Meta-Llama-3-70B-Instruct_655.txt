SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration". He believes that if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate, he may need to run as an independent to "make America great again". Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to agree to the debate. Despite his decision to step down as moderator, Trump still plans to make an endorsement, emphasizing the importance of selecting the correct candidate. By bowing out, Trump is keeping his options open, leaving the door ajar for a potential independent bid.

END OF SUMMARY.
