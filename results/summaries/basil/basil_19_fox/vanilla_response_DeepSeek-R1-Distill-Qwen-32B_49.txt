Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Donald Trump's decision to step down as the moderator for a Republican debate. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Trump announced he's bowing out as the moderator for the debate scheduled on December 27. The reason he gave was to avoid any conflict of interest if he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He mentioned that most candidates didn't attend, so he wanted to keep his options open.

He also said he's still considering an independent bid, especially if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate and the economy remains bad. Despite this, he plans to endorse a Republican candidate. The debate was technically sponsored by Newsmax, but Trump was the face of it. Some candidates like Gingrich and Santorum agreed to attend, but others dropped out, possibly worried about Trump's potential third-party run.

Trump cited concerns from RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and doesn't expect the debate to proceed without him. He expressed confidence that the debate would have been successful, highlighting his trademark self-assurance. He ended his statement by praising Gingrich and Santorum for their courage.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words, ensuring all key points are included: his withdrawal as moderator, the reason of conflict of interest, considering a third-party run, endorsing a Republican, the impact on the debate, and his praise for Gingrich and Santorum.

I should structure it to first state his decision, the reason, his consideration for a third-party run, his endorsement plan, the debate's sponsorship and candidates' responses, and his confidence in the debate's success. Also, mention his praise for Gingrich and Santorum.

Let me make sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll need to be concise and use clear, straightforward language to convey each point effectively.
