Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump stepping down as the moderator for a Republican debate. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Trump announced he's bowing out as the moderator for the Republican debate on December 27. The main reason he gave is to avoid a conflict of interest in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He mentioned that he's considering an independent bid if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate and the economy stays bad.

He still plans to endorse a Republican candidate, even though he's thinking about running independently. The debate was technically sponsored by Newsmax, but Trump became the main figure after being named moderator. Some candidates like Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend, but others dropped out, possibly worried Trump might run as a third-party candidate.

Trump also mentioned that without him, the debate might not happen. He expressed confidence that it would have been successful. He made this announcement in a written statement, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat Obama's administration but keeping his options open.

He praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage in attending the debate. The summary should include all these points concisely, under 200 words.

I'll start by stating Trump's decision to step down as moderator to avoid conflict of interest. Mention his possible third-party run and his endorsement plans. Note that other candidates dropped out due to concerns about his potential candidacy. Also, include that the debate might not proceed without him and his confidence in its success. End with his statement about choosing the right candidate and making America great again, as well as praising Gingrich and Santorum.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring all key points are included without unnecessary details.
