SUMMARY: Donald Trump has decided not to moderate a Republican presidential debate later this month, citing a potential "conflict of interest" in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure Republicans choose the "right" candidate to defeat the "failed and destructive" Obama administration. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to the debate, but most other candidates opted out due to concerns about Trump's possible third-party bid. Trump wants to keep his options open, and is still considering an independent run if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate and the economy remains weak. He stated that he must do what is necessary to "make America great again!" 

END OF SUMMARY.
