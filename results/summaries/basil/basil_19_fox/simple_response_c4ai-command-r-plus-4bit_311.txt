SUMMARY: Donald Trump has bowed out as the moderator of a Republican presidential debate due to a potential "conflict of interest," as he is considering running as a third-party candidate. This decision highlights his sense of moral responsibility and commitment to ensuring the right Republican candidate is chosen to defeat President Obama. Despite the setback, Trump remains confident in his ability to draw an audience and make a meaningful endorsement. 

Trump expressed concern about the potential for a "wrong" Republican candidate and the continued poor state of the economy. His decision was also influenced by the concerns of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and the lack of participation from most candidates. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend, while others were wary of Trump's potential third-party candidacy. 

Trump's statement emphasized the importance of keeping his options open and his unwavering commitment to making America great again. He praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage and confidence in agreeing to the debate. However, with Trump's withdrawal, the future of the Newsmax debate is now uncertain. 

END OF SUMMARY.
