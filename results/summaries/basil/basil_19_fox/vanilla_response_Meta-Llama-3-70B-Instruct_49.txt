SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open in case the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate. He stated that he is still considering an independent bid if the economy continues to decline and the Republicans select a poor candidate. Trump's decision comes after most candidates opted not to attend the debate, citing concerns that he might not rule out a third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to participate in the debate, but expressed doubt that the event will proceed without him. Trump emphasized his desire to see the "right" Republican candidate chosen to defeat the Obama administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
