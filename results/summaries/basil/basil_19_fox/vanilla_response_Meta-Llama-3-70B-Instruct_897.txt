SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate in 2016. Trump wants to keep his options open, considering an independent bid if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate or if the economy continues to decline. Despite this, Trump still plans to make an endorsement in the Republican primary. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, had already seen most candidates drop out due to concerns that Trump might not rule out a third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, the only two candidates who had agreed to attend, for their "courage, conviction, and confidence". Trump expressed confidence that the debate would have gotten high ratings with him as moderator, but now expects the event to be cancelled.

END OF SUMMARY.
