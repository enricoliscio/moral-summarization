SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is "chosen" to "defeat" the "failed" and "destructive" Obama administration. He believes it's crucial to keep his options open, including a possible independent bid, if the Republicans select the wrong candidate. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to participate in the debate. He emphasized that his primary goal is to "make America great again!" and will not rule out an independent run if the Republican party fails to select a suitable candidate. By stepping down as moderator, Trump aims to avoid any perceived bias and maintain his ability to potentially run as a third-party candidate.

END OF SUMMARY.
