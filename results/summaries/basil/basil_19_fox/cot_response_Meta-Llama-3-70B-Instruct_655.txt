SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open, ensuring that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. If not, he may consider an independent bid. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to agree to the debate. Trump's decision was influenced by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement. Despite his withdrawal, Trump expressed confidence that the debate would have gotten "great" ratings. END OF SUMMARY.
