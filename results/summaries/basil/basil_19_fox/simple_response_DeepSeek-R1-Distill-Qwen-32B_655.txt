Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Donald Trump stepping down as a moderator for a Republican debate. He's doing this to avoid a conflict of interest if he runs as a third-party candidate. 

First, I should identify the main points: Trump's decision to bow out, his reasoning about conflict of interest, his consideration of an independent bid, the candidates' concerns, and the implications for the debate.

I need to capture Trump's motivations clearly. He wants to keep his options open, implying he's prioritizing his potential future candidacy over his role in the Republican Party. This shows a potential conflict between his personal ambitions and the party's interests.

Also, the fact that most candidates didn't attend the debate because they were worried about Trump's impartiality highlights a deeper issue about trust and leadership within the party.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's announcement, his reasons, the candidates' reactions, and the broader implications. Keeping it under 200 words means being concise but comprehensive.

I'll start by stating Trump's decision, then explain his reasoning, mention the candidates' concerns, note that the debate might not happen, and conclude with his broader goal of making America great again. This should encapsulate the moral framing around ambition, conflict of interest, and party dynamics.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn as the moderator for an upcoming Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate in 2016. Trump emphasized his desire to keep his options open, stating he is considering an independent bid if the Republican field selects a candidate he deems unfit or if the economy deteriorates further. Despite his withdrawal, Trump expressed confidence in the debate's potential success and praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their willingness to participate. Other candidates reportedly withdrew due to concerns about Trump's impartiality, given his prior flirtation with a Republican candidacy. Trump's decision reflects his ambition to remain a viable political option while maintaining flexibility. The debate, originally slated for December 27, may now be canceled, as Trump does not expect Newsmax to proceed without him. Trump's actions highlight his focus on ensuring the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to oppose the Obama administration, while also preserving his own political future. END OF SUMMARY.
