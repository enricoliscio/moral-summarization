SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump claims he wants to keep his options open and ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the Obama administration. However, his decision raises questions about his true motives and commitment to the Republican party. Trump's actions can be seen as self-serving and opportunistic, as he prioritizes his own interests over the party's needs. By threatening to run as an independent candidate, Trump is holding the Republican party hostage and undermining the democratic process. His praise for Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, who agreed to attend the debate, rings hollow in light of his own self-interested actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
