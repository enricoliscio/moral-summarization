SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is "chosen" to "defeat" the "failed" and "destructive" Obama administration. He believes it's essential to keep his options open, including a possible independent bid, if the Republicans select the wrong candidate. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to participate in the debate. He emphasized that his priority is to "make America great again!" and will not rule out an independent run if necessary. Trump's decision to step down as moderator has likely ended the debate, which was scheduled for December 27.

END OF SUMMARY.
