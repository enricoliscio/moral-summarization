SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump's decision is seen as a way to keep his options open, as he is still considering an independent bid. He expressed his desire to ensure that the Republicans choose the "right" candidate, and threatened to run as a third-party candidate if they don't. Trump's move is seen as a moral imperative, as he prioritizes the country's interests over party loyalty. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their courage in agreeing to the debate, while criticizing other candidates for bowing out. Trump's decision is a testament to his commitment to putting America first, even if it means going against the Republican establishment.
