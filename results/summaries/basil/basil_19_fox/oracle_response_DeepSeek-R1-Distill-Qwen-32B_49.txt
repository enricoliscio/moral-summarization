Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is stepping down as a debate moderator because he might run as a third-party candidate. He mentions not wanting a conflict of interest. He's considering an independent bid if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate and the economy stays bad. He still plans to endorse someone. The debate was sponsored by Newsmax, but without him, it might not happen. He's confident it would have been successful. He praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage.

The author used words like "choose," "chosen," "defeat," "failed," "destructive," and "make." I need to include these in the summary. I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's decision, his reasons, and the implications. I should make sure to use those specific words to maintain the moral framing. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has stepped down as the moderator for a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He emphasized the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat the "failed and destructive" Obama administration but reserved his option to run independently if he deems the party's choice unsuitable. Trump expressed confidence that the debate, sponsored by Newsmax, would have "made" the Republican field "great" but now doubts it will proceed without him. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their "courage" in agreeing to attend but criticized the Republican National Committee's concerns about his involvement. Trump remains focused on ensuring the party selects the "right" candidate to "make America great again." END OF SUMMARY.
