SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump claims he wants to keep his options open and ensure the Republicans choose the "right" candidate. He still plans to make an endorsement, but is considering an independent bid if the economy remains bad and the Republicans choose a weak candidate. Trump's decision comes after most candidates opted not to attend the debate, citing concerns that he might not rule out a third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to participate, calling them courageous and confident. By stepping down, Trump is prioritizing the integrity of the Republican Party and putting the country's interests above his own ambitions.

END OF SUMMARY.
