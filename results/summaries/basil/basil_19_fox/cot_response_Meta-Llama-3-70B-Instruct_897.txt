SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open and ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to agree to the debate. Trump still plans to make an endorsement, but will consider an independent bid if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate. He believes the economy will continue to be bad, and if that's the case, he may run as a third-party candidate to "make America great again!"
END OF SUMMARY.
