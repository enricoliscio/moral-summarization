SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump stated that he wants to keep his options open in case the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate. He also expressed concerns about the economy and hinted that he may still endorse a Republican candidate. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, had already seen several Republican candidates withdraw due to concerns that Trump may not rule out a third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to participate in the debate, but expects Newsmax to cancel the event now that he is no longer involved. Trump remains confident in his ability to draw high ratings and reiterated his goal of making America great again.

END OF SUMMARY.
