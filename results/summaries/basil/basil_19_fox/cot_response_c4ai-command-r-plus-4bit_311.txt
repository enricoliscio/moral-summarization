SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has stepped down as moderator of a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" should he decide to run as an independent candidate. This decision came after most candidates opted out of the debate due to *concerns* about Trump's possible third-party bid. Trump wants to ensure Republicans choose the *right* candidate to defeat the *failed* and *destructive* Obama administration. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their *courage*, *conviction*, and *confidence* in agreeing to the debate. Trump expressed his trademark *confidence* that the debate would have been successful, but he wants to keep his options open. He still *considers* an independent bid if Republicans choose the *wrong* candidate and the economy remains poor. Despite this, Trump plans to endorse a Republican candidate.
END OF SUMMARY.
