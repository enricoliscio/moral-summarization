SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced he will not moderate a Republican presidential debate scheduled for December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" due to his possible independent candidacy in the 2012 election. Trump wants to ensure Republicans choose the "right" candidate to defeat President Obama, whom he describes as a failure who has led a destructive administration. He believes the economy will remain weak and that Republicans may choose the wrong candidate. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to the debate and expressed confidence that the debate would have been successful had he moderated it. Trump's decision follows concerns raised by Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee Chairman, and the reluctance of most Republican candidates to participate. Trump is keeping his options open for an independent bid, emphasizing the importance of selecting the right Republican candidate to make America great again.
END OF SUMMARY.
