Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, Donald Trump is stepping down as the moderator for a Republican debate. He says it's to avoid a conflict of interest in case he runs as a third-party candidate next year. He's still considering an independent bid if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate and the economy stays bad. He also mentions he'll endorse a Republican but wants to keep his options open. The debate was sponsored by Newsmax, but without Trump, it might not happen. He thinks the ratings would have been good. He praised Gingrich and Santorum for attending.

I need to capture the key points: Trump stepping down, his reasons, his consideration for a third-party run, his endorsement plan, and the impact on the debate. Also, note his confidence and the candidates' concerns.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's decision, his motivations, the potential third-party run, his endorsement, the debate's status, and the candidates' reactions. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is maintainedâ€”like his responsibility to the party versus his personal ambitions.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without being too wordy. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.
