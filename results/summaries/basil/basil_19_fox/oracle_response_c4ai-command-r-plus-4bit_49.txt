SUMMARY: Donald Trump has bowed out as moderator of a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" should he decide to run as a third-party candidate. This decision reflects his commitment to ensuring the Republican Party chooses the "right" candidate to defeat the "failed and destructive" Obama administration. Despite his threatened independent bid, Trump still plans to endorse a Republican candidate. 

Trump's involvement in the debate, sponsored by Newsmax, sparked concern among Republican candidates, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum initially agreeing to attend. Trump specifically referenced RNC Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns, indicating his influence as a potential third-party candidate could sway the Republican nomination. 

Trump praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage and confidence in agreeing to the debate, emphasizing his desire to keep his options open to "make America great again!" His decision underscores the importance he places on selecting a Republican candidate capable of defeating the incumbent administration, which he deems destructive and a failure. 

Trump's decision to step down from moderating the debate highlights the delicate balance of power within the Republican Party and the influence of external factors, such as potential third-party candidates, in shaping the course of the nomination process. 

END OF SUMMARY.
