SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn as moderator of a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" in case he decides to run as an independent candidate. He wants to ensure Republicans choose the "right" candidate to defeat what he calls the "failed and destructive" Obama administration. Trump wants to keep his options open, stating that he might run as an independent if Republicans choose the wrong candidate and the economy remains weak. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for their courage in agreeing to the debate, but most other candidates opted out due to concerns over Trump's possible third-party candidacy. Trump's decision came after RNC Chairman Reince Priebus expressed concerns, and he doesn't expect the debate to go ahead without him. Trump believes the debate would have been successful and garnered great ratings. He continues to consider an independent bid, emphasizing the importance of selecting the right Republican candidate to make America great again.
END OF SUMMARY.
