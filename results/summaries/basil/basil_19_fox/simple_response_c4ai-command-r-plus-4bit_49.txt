SUMMARY: Donald Trump, a man known for his business acumen and reality TV stardom, has once again flexed his political muscle by backing out of moderating a Republican presidential debate. Trump cited concerns over a potential "conflict of interest" as he may still run as an independent candidate in the upcoming election. He wants to ensure Republicans choose the "right" candidate and is keeping his options open in case they don't. Despite this, Trump still plans to endorse a Republican candidate. 

The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, quickly became associated with Trump, who was initially named as moderator. Only Gingrich and Santorum agreed to attend, while other candidates expressed wariness of Trump's possible third-party candidacy and refused to participate. Trump's decision respects the concerns of the Republican National Committee Chairman, Reince Priebus. Trump praised Gingrich and Santorum for their bravery in agreeing to the debate and emphasized his priority to make America great again. 

Trump's decision showcases his commitment to doing what he believes is best for America, even if it means sacrificing the chance to moderate a high-profile debate and potentially boost his own brand. 

END OF SUMMARY.
