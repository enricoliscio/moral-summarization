SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has stepped down as moderator for a Republican presidential debate, citing potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open, considering an independent bid if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate or if the economy continues to decline. Despite this, he still plans to make an endorsement. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, was initially well-received, with Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. However, other candidates bowed out, concerned that Trump might not rule out a third-party run. Trump's decision is framed as a selfless act, prioritizing the Republican Party's interests and ensuring the "right" candidate is chosen to defeat the Obama administration. Trump's trademark confidence is on display, as he praises Gingrich and Santorum for their "courage, conviction, and confidence" in agreeing to the debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
