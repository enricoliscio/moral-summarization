SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open, ensuring that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. If not, he may run as an independent candidate. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to participate in the debate. Despite his withdrawal, Trump still plans to make an endorsement, emphasizing the importance of choosing a candidate who will "make America great again!" Trump's decision was influenced by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement. END OF SUMMARY.
