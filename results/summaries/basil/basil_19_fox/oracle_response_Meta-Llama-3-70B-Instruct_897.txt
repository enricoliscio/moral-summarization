SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration". He emphasized that he must keep his options open to make America great again. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the courage to agree to the debate, but other candidates had bowed out due to concerns about Trump's potential third-party run. Trump stated that he is still considering an independent bid if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate. He believes the economy will continue to be bad, and if that's the case, he may run as an independent to make a difference. By stepping down as moderator, Trump aims to avoid any perceived conflict of interest within the Republican Party.

END OF SUMMARY.
