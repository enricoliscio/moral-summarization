SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump stated that he wants to keep his options open and ensure that the Republicans choose the "right" candidate. He also expressed concerns that the economy may continue to deteriorate, which could lead him to consider an independent bid. Trump's decision comes after most Republican candidates opted not to attend the debate, with some expressing concerns that he may not rule out a third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to participate in the debate, but doubts that the event will proceed without him as moderator.

END OF SUMMARY.
