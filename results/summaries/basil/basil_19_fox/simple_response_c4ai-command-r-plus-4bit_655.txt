SUMMARY: Donald Trump has bowed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate, citing a potential "conflict of interest" in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure Republicans pick the "right" candidate to defeat President Obama, but reserves the right to endorse a third-party candidate if the Republicans choose poorly. Trump's involvement in the debate raised concerns among Republican candidates, who feared he would not rule out a third-party run. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to the debate despite the controversy. Trump's decision was influenced by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns, and he expects the debate to be cancelled now that he has withdrawn. Trump expressed confidence that the debate would have garnered strong ratings. Trump's statement emphasized his commitment to keeping his options open in the best interest of America.

END OF SUMMARY.
