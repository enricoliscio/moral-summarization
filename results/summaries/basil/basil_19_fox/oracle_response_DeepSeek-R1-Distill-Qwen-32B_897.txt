Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified certain morally charged words that should be included: choose, chosen, defeat, failed, destructive, and make. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is stepping down as a debate moderator because he might run as an independent. He wants no conflict of interest. He's considering running if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate and the economy stays bad. He still plans to endorse someone. The debate was sponsored by Newsmax but Trump was the face of it. Some candidates dropped out because they were worried Trump might run as a third-party candidate. Trump cited RNC chairman's concerns and thinks the debate won't happen now. He's confident it would have been successful. He announced his decision in a statement, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat Obama. He praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes the moral words. I'll structure it to highlight Trump's decision, his reasons, and the implications. I'll make sure to use "choose," "chosen," "defeat," "failed," "destructive," and "make" where appropriate.

I should start by stating Trump's decision to step down as moderator. Mention his reason about conflict of interest and potential third-party run. Include his endorsement plan despite the run. Note the initial candidates and others dropping out. Cite RNC chairman's concerns. Trump's confidence in the debate's success. His statement about choosing the right candidate to defeat Obama. End with praise for Gingrich and Santorum.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft this, ensuring all moral words are included and the summary flows naturally.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating a Republican presidential debate to avoid a potential "conflict of interest," as he considers running as an independent candidate next year. He emphasized the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat the "failed and destructive" Obama administration but reserved the right to run independently if the party selects someone he deems unfit. Despite his decision, Trump plans to endorse a Republican candidate. The debate, sponsored by Newsmax, had initially drawn some candidates but lost momentum as others dropped out, concerned Trump might pursue a third-party bid. Trump cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns and expressed confidence the debate would have succeeded. In a statement, Trump stressed the need to make America great again and praised Gingrich and Santorum for their courage in agreeing to participate. END OF SUMMARY.
