SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate scheduled for December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Most candidates opted not to attend the debate due to concerns about Trump's potential third-party bid and his previous flirtation with a Republican candidacy. Trump wants to ensure Republicans pick the "right" candidate and is still considering an independent run if the "wrong" candidate is chosen and the economy remains poor. Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for agreeing to the debate and expressed confidence that the debate would have garnered high ratings. Trump's decision came after Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus expressed concerns about his involvement. 

END OF SUMMARY.
