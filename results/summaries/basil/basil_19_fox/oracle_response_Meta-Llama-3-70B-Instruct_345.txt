SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate a Republican presidential debate, citing concerns about a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to ensure that the "right" Republican candidate is "chosen" to "defeat" the "failed" and "destructive" Obama administration. However, if he deems the chosen candidate unfit, he reserves the right to run as an independent, emphasizing that he must "make America great again!" Trump praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to participate in the debate. Despite his withdrawal, Trump remains confident that he would have brought high ratings to the event. By stepping down, Trump is keeping his options open, prioritizing the ultimate goal of making America great again.

END OF SUMMARY.
