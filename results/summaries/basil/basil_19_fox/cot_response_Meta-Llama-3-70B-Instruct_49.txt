SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Republican presidential debate on December 27, citing a potential "conflict of interest" if he decides to run as a third-party candidate. Trump wants to keep his options open, ensuring that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. He praised Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for having the "courage, conviction, and confidence" to agree to the debate. Trump is still considering an independent bid, stating that he will not rule out running if the Republicans choose the "wrong" candidate. He believes the economy will continue to be bad, and wants to make sure America is made "great again!" Trump's decision to step down as moderator has led to uncertainty about the debate's future. END OF SUMMARY.
