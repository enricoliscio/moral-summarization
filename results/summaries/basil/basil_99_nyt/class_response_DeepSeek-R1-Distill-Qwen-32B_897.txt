Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words, and I need to make sure as many of those are included as possible in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee where Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. The hearing was tense, with accusations flying on both sides. The key elements are the conflict over Schiff's leadership, the accusations of McCarthyism, the mention of Mueller's report, and the moral terms used by both parties.

I notice that the author uses words like "investigation," "chasing," "immoral," "unethical," "corrupt," etc. I need to include these in the summary. The Republicans are accusing Schiff of McCarthyism, while Schiff is calling their actions unethical and unpatriotic.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the accusations, and the moral terms used. I'll start by mentioning the hearing and the demand for Schiff's resignation. Then, I'll note the accusations from both sides, including the use of terms like "McCarthyism" and Schiff's response about the conduct being immoral and unethical.

I also need to include the points about the Mueller report, the length, and the differing interpretations. Schiff's stance on the Russian collusion and the Democrats' support for him should be mentioned, as well as the Republicans' accusations of wrongdoing and corruption.

I should keep the summary tight, making sure each sentence encapsulates a key point without getting too detailed. I'll aim to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without forcing them in awkwardly.

Let me draft the summary step by step:

1. Start with the hearing and the demand for Schiff's resignation.
2. Mention the accusations of McCarthyism and Schiff's response about the conduct.
3. Include the points about the Mueller report and Schiff's concerns.
4. Note the Republicans' accusations of wrongdoing and corruption.
5. Highlight Schiff's defense and the moral terms he uses.
6. Conclude with the ongoing conflict and the Senate's separate investigation.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the necessary moral framing words and accurately reflects the article's content.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing, following Robert Mueller's report, saw Republicans demand Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and unethical conduct. Schiff defended his stance, calling the Trump campaign's actions with Russia immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, while Republicans argued Mueller's findings absolved Trump. The 300-page Mueller report raised questions about the four-page summary, with Schiff emphasizing concerns over secret communications and Russian collusion. Republicans accused Schiff of wrongdoing and corruption, while Democrats supported him, highlighting his professional and patriotic work. The hearing underscored the deep partisan divide, with both sides using moral terms to frame their arguments, as the Senate continued its separate investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
