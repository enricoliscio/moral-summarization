SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election was marred by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of "chasing" Russian collusion and promoting false information. Schiff refused, calling the president's conduct with Moscow "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." He listed several instances of wrongdoing, including secret back channels with Russians and lying to the FBI. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his calm and professional demeanor, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and undermining faith in US government institutions. The president intervened, accusing Schiff of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." The hearing highlighted the deep divide between Democrats and Republicans, with each side accusing the other of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat or trying to ruin the presidency. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to investigating Russian interference.
