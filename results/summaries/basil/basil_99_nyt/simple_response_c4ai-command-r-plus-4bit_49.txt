SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by partisan acrimony, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff, however, remained steadfast and signaled that the committee's investigation into evidence of foreign compromise would continue. He questioned the morality, ethics, and patriotism of the Trump campaign's conduct with Moscow, even as Republicans embraced Mueller's absolution of Trump. The hearing showcased the bitter divide in Congress, with Republicans accusing Schiff of "McCarthyism" and Democrats defending his integrity. The contrast with the Senate Intelligence Committee's quiet progress on its own Russia investigation was stark. Outside the hearing, Democrats expressed concern about a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump, his businesses, and administration, while Republicans accused them of trying to ruin the presidency. The whole episode underscored the sharp political divide and the ongoing struggle to address the threat of Russian interference.
