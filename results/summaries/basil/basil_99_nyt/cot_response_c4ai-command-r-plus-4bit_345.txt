SUMMARY:
At the House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller completed his report, Republicans demanded the resignation of the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff. The hearing, which was supposed to focus on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, devolved into partisan bickering and accusations. Republicans accused Schiff of promoting false information and undermining faith in US institutions, while Schiff countered that there is a difference between proving a criminal conspiracy and investigating evidence of foreign compromise. The hearing highlighted the bitter divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's absolution of Trump and Democrats determined to uncover what they see as a pattern of immoral, unethical, and corrupt wrongdoing by the president and his administration. The partisan divide was further exacerbated by Trump's intervention on Twitter, accusing Schiff of "lying and leaking," while Democrats defended Schiff's conduct as calm, professional, and patriotic. The hearing also featured testimony from experts warning about the growing threat of Russian interference in Western democracies, highlighting the need for a thorough investigation.
