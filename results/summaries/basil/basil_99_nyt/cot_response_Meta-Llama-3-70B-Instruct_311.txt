SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election was marred by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused, calling the president's conduct "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his work as "calm," "professional," and "patriotic." The party gave Schiff a nod of confidence, announcing he would serve as a key fundraiser for vulnerable members. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee continued its Russia investigation, aiming to finish witness interviews and issue a report in the coming months. The episode highlighted the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate wrongdoing by the Trump administration and Republicans accusing them of promoting false information.
