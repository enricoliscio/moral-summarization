SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election was marked by acrimony and partisan divisions. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff, meanwhile, remained defiant, arguing that there was evidence of immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic conduct by President Trump and his campaign. He highlighted potentially compromising contacts with Russia and questioned the integrity of Trump's son-in-law and associates. 

The committee's Republicans and Democrats clashed over the interpretation of Mueller's report, with Republicans embracing what they saw as Trump's absolution and Democrats emphasizing a pattern of wrongdoing. The hearing exposed the bitter divide in Congress, with personal attacks and accusations flying between the parties. 

Amid the partisan rancor, the hearing's subject matter – Putin's playbook and Russia's ongoing efforts to destabilize Western democracies – was somewhat overshadowed. The sharp contrast with the more measured and leak-free Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation was also noted. The Senate committee quietly continued its work, calling back Jared Kushner for another interview.
END OF SUMMARY.
