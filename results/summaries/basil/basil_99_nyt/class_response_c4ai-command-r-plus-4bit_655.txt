SUMMARY: At the House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller completed his report, Republicans demanded the resignation of the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and abusing his position. Schiff, however, remained steadfast, arguing that there is a difference between proving a criminal conspiracy and investigating evidence of foreign compromise. He questioned the morality, ethics, patriotism, and legality of the Trump campaign's actions during the 2016 election, including their contacts with Russia and attempts to undermine US sanctions. Democrats have backed Schiff, citing a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump, while Republicans have embraced Mueller's absolution of the president. The hearing laid bare the bitter divide in Congress, with Republicans accusing Schiff of McCarthyism and Democrats defending his work as calm, professional, and patriotic. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee continues its own Russia investigation at a more measured pace, calling back Jared Kushner for another interview. The episode highlights the sharp contrast between the two chambers and the ongoing partisan battles over the Mueller report's findings.
END OF SUMMARY.
