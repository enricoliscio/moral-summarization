SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marred by acrimony, with Republicans demanding Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation. Schiff refused, citing concerns over President Trump's "nefarious conduct" with Moscow, including attempts to establish a secret back channel with Russians and lying to the FBI. Schiff deemed such actions "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Republicans, who claim Mueller's report absolves Trump, accused Schiff of "chasing after Russian collusion" and "abusing" his position to promote "false information." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his "professional" and "patriotic" work. The committee's investigation will continue, despite Republican efforts to discredit Schiff. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee is quietly continuing its own Russia investigation, warning that Vladimir Putin's Russia will only grow bolder in its efforts to "destabilize" western democracies.
