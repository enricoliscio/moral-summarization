SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by acrimony and partisan divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and spreading false information. Schiff, undeterred, questioned the morality, ethics, and patriotism of Trump's conduct with Moscow, vowing to continue the committee's investigative work. He highlighted potentially compromising actions by Trump's son-in-law and associates, deeming them immoral and unpatriotic. Democrats backed Schiff, with Speaker Pelosi praising his calm and professional demeanor, in stark contrast to the "almost criminal" behavior of previous chair Devin Nunes. The committee's Republicans, however, labeled Schiff's actions as "McCarthyism," drawing parallels with Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade. The hearing showcased a sharp contrast between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, with the latter proceeding at a more measured pace. The partisan divide and personal attacks overshadowed the hearing's intended focus on Putin's playbook for destabilizing western democracies. The episode underscored the ongoing bitter divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's absolution of Trump and Democrats highlighting his pattern of wrongdoing.
END OF SUMMARY.
