SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter division. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused, citing immoral and unethical conduct by President Trump and his campaign regarding Russia. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his calm and professional demeanor, while Republicans accused him of chasing after Russian collusion. The Justice Department revealed that Mueller's report exceeded 300 pages, raising questions about the four-page summary released by Attorney General William Barr. Schiff vowed to continue investigating evidence of foreign compromise, despite Republican claims that Democrats are trying to ruin Trump's presidency. The episode highlighted the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to expose wrongdoing and Republicans accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat.
