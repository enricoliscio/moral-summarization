Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee where Republicans demanded the chairman's resignation. The main points are the conflict between Democrats and Republicans over the Mueller report, accusations of McCarthyism, and the chairman's stance on ethics. I should highlight the moral issues each side presents, like Republicans accusing Schiff of McCarthyism and Democrats emphasizing ethics. Also, include the broader context of the committee's work and the Senate's contrast. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing, following the release of Robert Mueller's report, exposed deep political divisions. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and unethical conduct, while Schiff defended his investigation into potential Trump-Russia collusion as a matter of morality and patriotism. Democrats backed Schiff, framing the issue as a fight against corruption, while Republicans argued Mueller cleared Trump, accusing Democrats of politicizing the investigation. The hearing highlighted the ongoing conflict over the Mueller findings, with Democrats emphasizing the need for accountability and Republicans dismissing the investigation as baseless. The contrast with the Senate's quieter, bipartisan approach underscored the partisan divide in Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
