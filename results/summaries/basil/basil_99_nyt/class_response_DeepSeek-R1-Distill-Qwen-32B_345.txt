Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about a House Intelligence Committee hearing after Mueller's report. Republicans demanded Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and unethical behavior. Schiff defended his actions, highlighting the moral issues like collusion and lying. Democrats support him, while Republicans are angered by his stance. The committee's work continues despite the conflict, and the Senate is handling their investigation differently.

I should focus on the conflict between parties, the moral accusations, and the implications for the investigation. I need to include words like "investigation," "chasing," "immoral," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," etc. I'll structure the summary to show the division, the accusations, and the ongoing work.

Let me make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the key moral terms. I'll start by setting the scene of the hearing, mention the accusations, Schiff's defense, and the ongoing work in the Senate. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee hearing after Robert Mueller's report revealed deep partisan divisions. Republicans accused Chairman Adam Schiff of unethical and immoral conduct, likening him to McCarthyism, while Schiff defended his investigation into potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. He criticized actions like the president's son-in-law seeking a secret back channel with Russia and associates' contacts with hostile intelligence agencies, calling such behavior "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt." Republicans, embracing Mueller's findings, accused Schiff of abusing his position to promote false information, demanding his resignation. Schiff, backed by Democrats, argued the committee's work must continue, emphasizing the difference between criminal conspiracy and foreign compromise. The hearing highlighted the ongoing ideological conflict in Congress, with Democrats and Republicans clashing over the integrity of the investigation and the threat of Russian interference. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee quietly continued its own probe, underscoring the stark contrast in approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
