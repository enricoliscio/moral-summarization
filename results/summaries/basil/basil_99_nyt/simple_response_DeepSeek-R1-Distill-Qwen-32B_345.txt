Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the House Intelligence Committee hearing after Mueller's report, the conflict between Republicans and Democrats, and the accusations flying both ways.

The user wants the summary to be no longer than 200 words, so I need to be concise. I should focus on the key events: the Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation, the accusations of McCarthyism, Schiff's response about the unethical conduct, and the broader implications of the partisanship.

I also need to maintain the moral framing. The article highlights the ethical concerns from both sidesâ€”Democrats accusing Republicans of ignoring Russian threats and Republicans accusing Democrats of spreading false information. Schiff's strong stance on the unethical behavior and the partisanship affecting the committee's work are crucial points.

I'll structure the summary by starting with the hearing's setup, then the conflict, Schiff's arguments, the accusations from both sides, and the implications for the committee's work. I should ensure that the moral aspects are clearly presented without bias, reflecting the author's framing.

Finally, I'll keep the summary within the word limit, making sure it's clear and captures all essential elements without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee hearing, following Robert Mueller's report, highlighted deep partisan divisions in Congress. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and unethical conduct, while Schiff criticized the Trump administration's ties to Russia as "immoral" and "unpatriotic." Democrats defended Schiff, emphasizing their commitment to investigating potential wrongdoing, while Republicans claimed Mueller exonerated Trump and accused Democrats of politicizing the issue. The hearing revealed a toxic environment, with both sides trading accusations and undermining each other's credibility. Despite the acrimony, the committee's work continues, with Democrats vowing to hold Trump accountable, while Republicans accuse them of abusing their power. The clash underscored the ongoing polarization in Congress over the Russia investigation and its implications for U.S. democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
