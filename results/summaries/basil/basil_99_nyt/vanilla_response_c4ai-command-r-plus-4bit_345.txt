SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee held its first hearing since Robert Mueller completed his report, but the hearing was marred by partisan bickering and accusations. Republicans demanded the resignation of the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff defended himself, arguing that there is a difference between criminal conspiracy and foreign compromise, and signaled that the committee's investigative work would continue. The hearing included testimony from experts on Russia's efforts to destabilize western democracies, who warned that Vladimir Putin's Russia would only grow bolder. The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, has continued its investigation at a slower pace, and has called Jared Kushner back for another interview. The partisan divide over the Mueller report and the role of the Intelligence Committees highlights the ongoing tensions in Congress and the differing approaches taken by the House and Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
