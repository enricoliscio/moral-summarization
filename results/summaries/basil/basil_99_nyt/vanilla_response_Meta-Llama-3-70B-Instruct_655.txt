SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans demanded the resignation of Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused to step down, citing concerns over President Trump's campaign's conduct with Moscow and the need to see Mueller's full report. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his work as chairman, while Republicans accused him of McCarthyism. The hearing laid bare the deepening partisan divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate Trump's campaign and Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution for the president. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to its own Russia investigation.
