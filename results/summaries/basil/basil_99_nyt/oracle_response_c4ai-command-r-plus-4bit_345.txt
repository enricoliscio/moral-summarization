SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of the Mueller report was marked by acrimony and partisan divides. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and abusing his position. Schiff, undeterred, questioned the morality, ethics, and patriotism of the Trump campaign's conduct with Moscow, citing specific instances of potentially compromising behavior. Democrats backed Schiff, expressing determination to investigate a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. Republicans, on the other hand, embraced Mueller's absolution of Trump and accused Democrats of attempting to ruin his presidency. The hearing, ironically, focused on Putin's playbook for destabilizing western democracies, with witnesses warning of an ideological fight between Putinism and the West. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee quietly continued its own Russia investigation, calling Jared Kushner for another interview. The contrasting approaches of the House and Senate committees highlighted the partisan divide and the ongoing battle over the interpretation of Mueller's findings.
END OF SUMMARY.
