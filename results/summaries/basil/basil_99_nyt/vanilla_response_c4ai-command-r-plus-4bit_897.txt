SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marked by acrimony and partisan divisions, with Republicans demanding the resignation of the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff. Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his position and promoting false information, while Schiff defended his actions and argued that the committee's investigation into foreign compromise by the Trump campaign would continue. The hearing came after the release of a summary of Mueller's report, which found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia but did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice. Democrats are determined to continue investigating Trump's wrongdoing, while Republicans have embraced Mueller's absolution of Trump. The hearing featured sharp exchanges and attacks on Schiff's character, with Trump himself calling for Schiff's resignation via Twitter. The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, is continuing its own investigation with a more bipartisan and measured approach, quietly calling back Jared Kushner for another interview. 

END OF SUMMARY.
