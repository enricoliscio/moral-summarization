SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "McCarthyism" and promoting false information. Schiff refused, citing the need to investigate Russia's intervention in the 2016 election and President Trump's campaign's nefarious conduct with Moscow. He condemned the campaign's attempts to establish secret back channels with Russia, contact with hostile intelligence agencies, and undermining of US sanctions as "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his professionalism and patriotism, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and damaging the committee's integrity. The hearing laid bare the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to uncover wrongdoing and Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution for Trump. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to investigating Russian interference. END OF SUMMARY.
