Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Mueller's report. Republicans demanded Schiff's resignation, which caused a lot of tension. Schiff defended his position, emphasizing that he wouldn't accept Barr's summary without seeing the full report. The Republicans accused him of McCarthyism and spreading false information. Democrats supported Schiff, and Trump even tweeted about him. The hearing was supposed to discuss Russia's interference but ended up being a political fight. The Senate committee is still working on their investigation. I should highlight the main points: the conflict in the House committee, Schiff's stance, Republican accusations, Democratic support, and the contrast with the Senate's ongoing work. Keep it concise, under 200 words.
