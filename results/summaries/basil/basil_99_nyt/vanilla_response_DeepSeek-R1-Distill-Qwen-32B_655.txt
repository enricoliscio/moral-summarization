Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Mueller's report. The Republicans are demanding Schiff's resignation. There's a lot of tension and accusations between the parties. Schiff is standing his ground, while Republicans are comparing him to McCarthy. They're upset because Schiff isn't accepting Barr's summary and wants to see the full report. Democrats support Schiff, and there's mention of the Senate committee moving forward separately. The summary needs to capture the main points: the conflict, the reasons behind it, key players, and the implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and objective.
