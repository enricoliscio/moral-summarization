Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Mueller's report. Republicans demanded Schiff's resignation, comparing him to McCarthy. Schiff defended his position, stating that certain actions were immoral and unethical. Democrats support him, while Republicans accuse him of abusing his position. The hearing highlighted divisions in Congress over the Mueller investigation.

I should focus on the key elements: the hearing, the demand for Schiff's resignation, the comparison to McCarthy, Schiff's moral arguments, the split between parties, and the broader context of the Mueller report and Russia interference.

I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral aspects. Let me structure it: start with the hearing, mention the Republican demand and McCarthy comparison, then Schiff's response emphasizing morality, followed by the party divide, and conclude with the implications of the hearing.

Make sure to include that Democrats back Schiff and Republicans accuse him of wrongdoing. Also, note that the hearing was during a discussion on Russia's playbook, adding context about ongoing investigations.

I think that's a solid summary. Let me put it together concisely, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing.
