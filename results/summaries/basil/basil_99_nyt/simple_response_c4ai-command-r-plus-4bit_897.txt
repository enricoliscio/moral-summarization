SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marked by acrimony and partisan divide, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff defended his stance, arguing that there is a moral, ethical, and patriotic duty to investigate evidence of foreign compromise. He highlighted instances of potentially immoral and unethical behavior by the Trump campaign and administration, despite the Mueller report's conclusion of no criminal conspiracy. The divide reflects a broader rift in Congress, with Democrats determined to scrutinize Trump's conduct and Republicans embracing Mueller's absolution of the president. The hearing featured warnings from experts about the threat of Putin's Russia to western democracies. The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, continues its own investigation with a more subdued and bipartisan approach.
