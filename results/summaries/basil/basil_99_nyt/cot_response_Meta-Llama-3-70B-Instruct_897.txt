SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election turned into a bitter confrontation, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff refused, calling the Trump campaign's conduct "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." He listed several instances of questionable behavior, including secret back-channel communications with Russians and lying to the FBI. Republicans, who have accepted Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report, accused Schiff of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." The president also weighed in, calling for Schiff's resignation. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his "calm, professional, patriotic" leadership. The episode highlighted the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate the Trump campaign's wrongdoing and Republicans accusing them of trying to ruin the presidency.
