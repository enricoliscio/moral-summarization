SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee held its first hearing since Robert Mueller completed his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, but the hearing was marred by partisan acrimony. Republicans demanded the resignation of the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff, in turn, argued that there was a difference between Mueller's criminal investigation and the committee's probe into foreign compromise. Democrats backed Schiff, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling him "calm, professional, and patriotic," while Republicans, including President Trump, continued their attacks on Schiff outside the hearing room. The hearing also featured testimony from experts on Russian President Vladimir Putin's tactics, who warned that Russia would grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee quietly continued its own Russia investigation, calling back Jared Kushner for another interview.
END OF SUMMARY.
