SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "chasing" Russian collusion and promoting false information. Schiff refused, citing immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic conduct by President Trump's campaign and administration. He highlighted instances of wrongdoing, including secret back channels with Russians, lying to the FBI, and undermining US sanctions. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his calm, professional, and patriotic demeanor. Republicans, however, embraced Mueller's findings as absolution for Trump, accusing Democrats of ruining his presidency. The committee's investigation will continue, despite Republican attempts to discredit Schiff. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan approach to its own Russia investigation. As the House committee's work proceeds, Democrats will focus on uncovering evidence of foreign compromise and wrongdoing, while Republicans will continue to accuse them of spreading false information and conspiracies.

END OF SUMMARY.
