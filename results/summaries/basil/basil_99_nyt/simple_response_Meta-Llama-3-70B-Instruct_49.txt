SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of the Mueller report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused to step down, citing immoral and unpatriotic conduct by the Trump campaign and administration. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his calm and professional demeanor, while Republicans accused him of chasing after Russian collusion. The hearing laid bare the deep partisan divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate wrongdoing by Trump and his associates, and Republicans embracing the Mueller report's findings as absolution. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to its own Russia investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
