SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marked by acrimony and partisan divide, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff, however, remained steadfast, questioning the morality, ethics, and patriotism of the Trump campaign's conduct with Moscow. He argued that the committee's investigation should continue, even without seeing Mueller's report first. Democrats backed Schiff, expressing concern about a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his position and spreading false information. The hearing featured expert testimony on Putin's tactics and intentions, but the partisan divide overshadowed the discussion. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee quietly continued its own Russia investigation, interviewing Jared Kushner again. The sharp contrast between the House and Senate committees underscores the challenges of conducting a bipartisan investigation into Russia's election interference.
