SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of the Mueller report was marked by acrimony and partisan divides, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. The hearing aimed to resume the committee's work on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, but instead devolved into accusations and defenses of President Trump's conduct with Moscow. Schiff refused to step down and insisted on the importance of investigating evidence of foreign compromise, despite Republican claims that he was chasing conspiracy theories. The committee's work will continue, with Schiff determined to uncover any wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. The hearing also included warnings from experts about Vladimir Putin's efforts to destabilize western democracies. The partisan divide contrasts the Senate Intelligence Committee's more measured approach, which continues its investigation with a yawning pace and no-leaks team.

END OF SUMMARY.
