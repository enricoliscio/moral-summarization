SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marked by acrimony and partisan divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff countered that there is a difference between criminal conspiracy and foreign compromise, signaling the committee's investigative work will continue. He questioned the morality, ethics, and patriotism of the Trump campaign's conduct with Moscow. Democrats backed Schiff, with Speaker Pelosi praising his calm and professional demeanor. The hearing featured testimony from experts warning about Vladimir Putin's efforts to destabilize western democracies. The sharp contrast between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' approaches was highlighted, with the Senate committee quietly continuing its own Russia investigation. The partisan divide and moral framing of the Russia investigation persist, even after Mueller's report.
END OF SUMMARY.
