SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election turned acrimonious as Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff refused, accusing President Trump and his campaign of "nefarious conduct" with Moscow. He argued that the committee's investigation would continue, despite Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report. Schiff's stance was backed by Democrats, who see a "deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing" by Trump and his administration. Republicans, on the other hand, accused Schiff of promoting false information and undermining faith in government institutions. The moral framing of the article suggests that Schiff's actions are patriotic and ethical, while Trump and his allies are corrupt and unpatriotic. The article implies that the Republican Party is more interested in protecting Trump than in addressing the Russian threat to American democracy.
