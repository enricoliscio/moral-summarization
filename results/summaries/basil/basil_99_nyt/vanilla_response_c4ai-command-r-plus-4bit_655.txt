SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of the Mueller report was marked by partisan acrimony, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff and accusing him of spreading false information. Schiff defended his actions, arguing that the committee's investigation into foreign compromise by the Trump campaign would continue. Democrats backed Schiff, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi praising his work as chairman and the party appointing him as a key fundraiser for vulnerable members. The hearing, ironically focused on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, featured warnings from experts about Vladimir Putin's growing boldness in destabilizing western democracies. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee quietly continued its own Russia investigation, calling back Jared Kushner for another interview. The partisan divide in Congress persists despite Mueller's investigation conclusion, with Republicans embracing the report as absolution for Trump and Democrats remaining troubled by his conduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
