SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by acrimony and partisan attacks. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff defended himself, arguing that there is a difference between criminal conspiracy and evidence of foreign compromise, and that the committee's investigation into Trump's immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic conduct would continue. He highlighted instances of Trump's associates' contact with Russian intelligence and efforts to undermine U.S. sanctions. Democrats backed Schiff, with Speaker Pelosi calling him "calm, professional, and patriotic," in contrast to the previous chair, Devin Nunes. The hearing featured expert testimony warning of Russia's bold and destabilizing tactics, but the partisan divide and continued investigation into Trump's wrongdoing overshadowed the proceedings. The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, quietly continues its own Russia investigation, interviewing Jared Kushner again.
END OF SUMMARY.
