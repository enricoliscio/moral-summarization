SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the release of the Mueller report was marked by acrimony and bitter division. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff refused, citing the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise and wrongdoing by the Trump campaign. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his professionalism and patriotism. The hearing laid bare the deep divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing the Mueller report's findings as absolution for Trump and Democrats determined to continue investigating. The committee's work will continue, with Schiff signaling that it may need to shift course once the full Mueller report is released. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has continued its own Russia investigation in a more bipartisan and low-key manner.

END OF SUMMARY.
