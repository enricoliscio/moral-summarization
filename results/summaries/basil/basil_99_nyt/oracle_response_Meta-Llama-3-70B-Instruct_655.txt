SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the Mueller report's completion was marred by acrimony, with Republicans demanding Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation. The bitter divide persists in Congress, with Schiff refusing to step down or absolve President Trump of nefarious conduct with Moscow. Schiff condemned the president's son-in-law's attempts to establish a secret back channel with Russians and an associate's contact with a hostile intelligence agency, calling it "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his professionalism and patriotism, while Republicans accused him of promoting false information and undermining faith in government institutions. The president intervened, accusing Schiff of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." The committee's work will continue, with Schiff vowing to investigate evidence of foreign compromise. The episode highlighted the deepening partisan divide, with Democrats determined to expose wrongdoing and Republicans accusing them of trying to ruin the presidency.
