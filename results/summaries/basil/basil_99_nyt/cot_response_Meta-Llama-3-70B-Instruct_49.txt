SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election was marred by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of being "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic" for not accepting Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report. Schiff refused to step down, calling the Trump campaign's conduct with Moscow "nefarious" and "corrupt." Democrats backed Schiff, praising him as "calm, professional, and patriotic." The party gave him a nod of confidence, announcing he would serve as a key fundraiser for vulnerable members. The hearing highlighted the deep divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's findings and Democrats determined to investigate further. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to the Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
