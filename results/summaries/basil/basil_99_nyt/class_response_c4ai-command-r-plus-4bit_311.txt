SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by acrimony and partisan divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff defended his actions, distinguishing between criminal conspiracy and evidence of foreign compromise. He highlighted instances of immoral, unethical, and potentially corrupt conduct by the Trump campaign, including seeking secret back channels with Russia and conferring with the Russian ambassador about undermining US sanctions. Democrats back Schiff, citing a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. Republicans, however, embrace Mueller's absolution of Trump and accuse Democrats of attempting to ruin his presidency. The hearing featured expert testimony on Putin's playbook of using oligarchs, money, and intelligence to destabilize western democracies. The sharp contrast between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' approaches was evident, with the Senate committee quietly continuing its investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
