SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election was marred by acrimony and bitter divides. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "McCarthyism" and promoting false information. Schiff refused, citing immoral and unethical conduct by President Trump and his campaign, including attempts to establish secret back channels with Russians and lying to the FBI. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his calm and professional demeanor, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and undermining faith in government institutions. The committee's investigation will continue, despite Republican attempts to discredit Schiff and absolve Trump of wrongdoing. The hearing highlighted the deep moral divide between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats determined to expose Trump's corrupt behavior and Republicans eager to turn a blind eye to the Russian threat.

END OF SUMMARY.
