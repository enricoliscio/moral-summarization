Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the House Intelligence Committee hearing after the Mueller report, with a lot of conflict between Republicans and Democrats. The author used specific morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It starts with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Schiff, accusing him of McCarthyism. Schiff defends his actions, calling certain conduct immoral and unethical. The Mueller report is mentioned as over 300 pages, but only a summary was released. Schiff is critical of the Trump administration's actions regarding Russia. Democrats support him, while Republicans are angered, feeling he's abusing his position. Trump himself tweets about Schiff lying and leaking. The hearing was about Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, and the Senate is handling their investigation more quietly.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the author's list: investigation, fueled, infiltrated, chasing, conduct, conferred, undermining, lied, immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, corrupt, wrongdoing, embraced, threat, assertions, abused, promote, damaged, undermined, actions, incompatible, knowingly, lying, leaking, conspiracy, compromise, behavior, convict, used, conspiracies, bolder, destabilize, underestimating.

I should include as many of these as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and capture the conflict, the accusations, and the moral stances taken by both sides.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Republicans demand Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism. Schiff counters by highlighting immoral and unethical conduct by Trump's associates. The Mueller report's details are still unknown, leading to questions. Democrats support Schiff, while Republicans feel he's damaged the committee's integrity. Trump criticizes Schiff on Twitter. The hearing was about Russia's election interference, with experts warning of continued threats. The Senate is proceeding more quietly.

I'll make sure to include words like investigation, chasing, conduct, undermine, lied, immoral, unethical, corrupt, wrongdoing, embraced, threat, assertions, damaged, incompatible, lying, leaking, conspiracies, destabilize.

Putting it all together, I need to craft a summary that flows well, includes these terms, and stays within the word limit.
