SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of Robert Mueller's report was marred by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused to step down, stating that he would not absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow without seeing the full report. He condemned the president's actions as "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his work as "calm, professional, and patriotic." The episode highlighted the deepening partisan divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution for Trump and Democrats determined to investigate further. The committee's work will continue, with Schiff signaling that it may need to shift course once Mueller's findings are fully understood. END OF SUMMARY.
