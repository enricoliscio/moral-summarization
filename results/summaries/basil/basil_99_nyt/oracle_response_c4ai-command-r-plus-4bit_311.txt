SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marked by acrimony and partisan divide, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff defended his position, arguing that there is a difference between criminal conspiracy and foreign compromise, and questioned the morality and patriotism of the Trump campaign's conduct with Moscow. Democrats backed Schiff, citing a "pattern of wrongdoing" by Trump, while Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his position and promoting false information. The hearing featured testimony from experts on Putin's efforts to destabilize Western democracies, providing a sharp contrast to the more bipartisan approach of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The episode highlights the ongoing bitter divide in Congress, with Democrats seeking to investigate Trump's conduct and Republicans embracing Mueller's absolution of the president.
