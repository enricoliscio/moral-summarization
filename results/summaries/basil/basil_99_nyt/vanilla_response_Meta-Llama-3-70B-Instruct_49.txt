SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter division. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff refused to step down, citing the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise and wrongdoing by President Trump and his campaign. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his work as chairman, while Republicans accused him of McCarthyism. The hearing laid bare the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate Trump's conduct and Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to its own Russia investigation. As the House committee's work continues, Schiff signaled that it may need to shift course once Mueller's full report is released.

END OF SUMMARY.
