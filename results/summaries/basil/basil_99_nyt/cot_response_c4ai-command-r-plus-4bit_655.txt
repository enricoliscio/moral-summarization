SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marked by acrimony, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff refused, stating that there is a difference between proving criminal conspiracy and investigating foreign compromise. He highlighted immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic conduct by the Trump campaign, including secret communications with Russians and undermining sanctions. Democrats support Schiff's stance, calling his work calm, professional, and patriotic, while Republicans accuse him of spreading false information and abusing his position. The hearing showcased a bitter divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's absolution of Trump and Democrats troubled by a pattern of wrongdoing. The committee's work will continue, but the partisan rancor and mutual accusations of immoral behavior persist. 

END OF SUMMARY.
