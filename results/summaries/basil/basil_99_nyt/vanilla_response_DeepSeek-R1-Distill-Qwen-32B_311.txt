Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the House Intelligence Committee hearing. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the hearing where Republicans demanded the chairman, Adam Schiff, resign. It's tense because of the Mueller report. Schiff is being criticized by Republicans like Kevin McCarthy and Michael Turner, comparing him to McCarthy from the 50s. Schiff isn't backing down, saying the president's actions with Russia are wrong. The Mueller report is 300+ pages, so there's more to uncover. Democrats support Schiff, while Republicans think Mueller cleared Trump. Schiff is a key fundraiser for Democrats now. The Senate is handling their investigation more quietly. 

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll focus on the main points: the hearing's conflict, Schiff's stance, Republican accusations, Mueller report details, and the contrast with the Senate. Make sure to mention both parties' reactions and the implications. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing after Robert Mueller's report was marked by intense partisanship. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and failing to accept Mueller's findings that cleared Trump of collusion. Schiff defended his stance, emphasizing concerns over Trump's administration's ties to Russia and rejecting Republicans' claims. The Mueller report, over 300 pages, raised questions about its summary's completeness. Democrats supported Schiff, while Republicans criticized him for promoting false information. Trump also attacked Schiff on Twitter. The hearing highlighted the deep divide in Congress over Russia's 2016 election interference. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee continued its investigation quietly. END OF SUMMARY.
