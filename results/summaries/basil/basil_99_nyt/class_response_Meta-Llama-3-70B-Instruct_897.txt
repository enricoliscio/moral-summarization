SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marred by acrimony, with Republicans demanding Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation. The bitter divide persists in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate Russia's intervention in the 2016 election and Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution for President Trump. Schiff refused to step down, citing immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic conduct by Trump's campaign, including secret back channels with Russians and lies to the FBI. Republicans, including Trump, accused Schiff of knowingly promoting false information and damaging the committee's integrity. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his calm, professional, and patriotic leadership. The party also gave him a nod of confidence, announcing he would serve as a key fundraiser for vulnerable members. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee continues its own Russia investigation, aiming to finish witness interviews and issue a report in the coming months. The episode highlights the sharp contrast between the two committees and the ongoing bitter divide in Congress.
