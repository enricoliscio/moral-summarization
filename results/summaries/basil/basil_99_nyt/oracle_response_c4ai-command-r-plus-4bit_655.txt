SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by partisan acrimony, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff refused, citing evidence of President Trump's campaign's nefarious conduct and immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt actions. Democrats support Schiff, vowing to continue investigating Trump's wrongdoing despite Republican efforts to absolve him. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Republicans "scaredy-cats," while Trump accused Schiff of lying and leaking. The hearing featured experts warning of Vladimir Putin's destabilizing agenda, yet the partisan divide persists, with the Senate Intelligence Committee quietly continuing its own Russia probe.
END OF SUMMARY.
