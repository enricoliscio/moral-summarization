SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee’s hearing, following the release of Robert Mueller’s report, was marked by intense partisanship and moral accusations. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff’s resignation, accusing him of "abusing his position" and "promoting false information," while Schiff defended his investigation into potential "nefarious conduct" by President Trump and his campaign. Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, likened Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, charging him with "chasing" Russian collusion. Schiff, however, accused the Trump administration of "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic" actions, including "secret back channels" with Russia and "undermining" U.S. sanctions. The 300-page Mueller report raised questions about the four-page summary released by Attorney General William Barr, with Schiff warning against "corrupt" behavior and "wrongdoing." Democrats praised Schiff as "professional" and "patriotic," while Republicans accused him of "lying" and "leaking." The hearing highlighted the deep divide in Congress over Russia’s 2016 election interference, with Democrats vowing to continue their "investigative" work despite Republican accusations of "irresponsible" and "criminal" behavior. The conflict underscored the ongoing ideological battle over Trump’s administration and its ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
