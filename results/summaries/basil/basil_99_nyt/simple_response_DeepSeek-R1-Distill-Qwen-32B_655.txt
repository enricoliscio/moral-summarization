Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral aspects involved.

The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Robert Mueller's report. There's a lot of conflict between Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. They're comparing him to Joseph McCarthy, which is a strong moral criticism. Schiff is standing his ground, arguing that certain actions by Trump and his associates are immoral and unethical. The article also mentions the Mueller report's length and the Democrats' intention to continue their investigation despite the Republicans' accusations.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements: the accusations of McCarthyism, the ethical concerns about Trump's actions, and the partisanship in Congress. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the main players and their arguments.

Let me outline the main points:

1. The House Intelligence Committee hearing after Mueller's report.
2. Republicans demand Schiff's resignation, comparing him to McCarthy.
3. Schiff defends his stance, calling certain actions immoral and unethical.
4. The Mueller report's length raises questions.
5. Democrats continue their investigation, while Republicans accuse them of partisanship.
6. Schiff's support from Democrats and the contrast with Nunes.
7. The Senate's ongoing investigation in contrast.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points, emphasizing the moral framing as per the user's request. I need to ensure it's clear and concise, highlighting the ethical concerns and the partisanship without getting bogged down in too many details.

I should start with the conflict over Schiff's leadership, mention the McCarthy comparison, Schiff's response, the Mueller report's implications, and the ongoing divide in Congress. I'll also touch on the Senate's approach as a contrast to show the broader context.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence adds value and contributes to the moral framing without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing after Robert Mueller's report revealed deep partisan divisions. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism for pursuing the Russia investigation. Schiff defended his stance, calling certain Trump administration actions "immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic." The 300-page Mueller report raised questions about the four-page summary released by Attorney General William Barr. Democrats plan to continue their investigation, while Republicans argue Mueller exonerated Trump. Schiff faced accusations of abusing his position, with President Trump also criticizing him. Despite the backlash, Schiff vowed to continue the committee's work. Democrats supported him, with Nancy Pelosi praising his professionalism. The hearing highlighted the ongoing ideological clash in Congress, contrasting with the Senate's more bipartisan approach to the Russia probe. END OF SUMMARY.
