SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by partisan acrimony, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff, however, refused to step down and defended his investigation into President Trump's alleged wrongdoing, arguing that there is a difference between criminal conspiracy and foreign compromise. He criticized several actions taken by Trump's associates, including establishing secret back channels with Russia and making direct contact with Russian military intelligence, as immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Democrats backed Schiff, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and spreading false information. The hearing came as the Justice Department revealed that Mueller's report was over 300 pages long, raising questions about the accuracy of Attorney General Barr's summary. Outside the hearing, Democrats expressed concern about a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump and his administration, while Republicans embraced Mueller's absolution of Trump. The sharp divide between the parties underscores the ongoing partisan battle over the investigation into Russian interference.
