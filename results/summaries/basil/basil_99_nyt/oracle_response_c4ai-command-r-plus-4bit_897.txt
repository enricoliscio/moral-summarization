SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller completed his report was marked by acrimony and partisan divide, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff, undeterred, questioned the morality, ethics, and patriotism of Trump's conduct with Moscow, despite Mueller's findings. He vowed to continue the committee's investigative work, accusing the president's son-in-law of seeking a secret back channel with Russia and an associate of making contact with Russian military intelligence. He deemed such actions "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." Democrats backed Schiff, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and undermining faith in government institutions. The partisan divide reflects differing interpretations of Mueller's report, with Democrats focusing on a pattern of wrongdoing and Republicans embracing absolution of the president. The hearing ironically focused on Putin's playbook for destabilizing western democracies, with witnesses warning of an ideological fight between Putinism and the West. The sharp contrast with the Senate Intelligence Committee's measured pace and bipartisan approach underscores the deep divide in Congress.
