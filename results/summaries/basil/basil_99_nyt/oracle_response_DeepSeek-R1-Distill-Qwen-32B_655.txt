Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary must include as many of the morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article describes a heated hearing in the House Intelligence Committee where Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation. There's a lot of conflict between parties, accusations of McCarthyism, and references to the Mueller report. 

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author. The list provided includes words like "fueled," "chasing," "nefarious," "immoral," etc. I should make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the original moral tone.

I'll start by outlining the key events: the hearing, Republican demands, Schiff's response, accusations from both sides, and the underlying conflict over the Mueller report. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the conflict, the accusations, and the moral implications. I'll ensure that each paragraph in the summary captures a main point without getting too detailed.

I should also make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the event, moving to the accusations, and ending with the broader implications. Including words like "nefarious," "immoral," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt" will help maintain the moral framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered while preserving the moral language. This should provide a clear, concise, and morally framed summary as requested.

SUMMARY:  
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's 2016 election interference was marred by intense partisanship, as Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "McCarthyism" and "chasing" false claims of Russian collusion. Schiff defended his investigation, calling certain actions by Trump associates "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt." Republicans, citing Mueller's findings, accused Schiff of "abusing" his position to spread false information, claiming his actions were "incompatible" with his role. Democrats, led by Schiff, maintained that the committee's work must continue, emphasizing the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise. The clash highlighted the ongoing divide in Congress over Russia's interference, with Democrats accusing Republicans of "undermining" the committee's integrity and Republicans accusing Democrats of "spreading conspiracies." The hearing underscored the toxic political environment and the broader struggle to address Russia's ongoing efforts to destabilize Western democracies. END OF SUMMARY.
