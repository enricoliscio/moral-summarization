SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee held its first hearing since the completion of the Mueller report, but the hearing was overshadowed by partisan divisions and accusations. Republicans demanded the resignation of the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff defended himself, arguing that there is a difference between criminal conspiracy and evidence of foreign compromise. The hearing also included testimony from experts on Russia's efforts to interfere in Western democracies, including the US. The Senate Intelligence Committee is continuing its own investigation and has called Jared Kushner back for another interview. The partisan divide and acrimony on display at the hearing reflect the ongoing tensions in Congress regarding the Mueller report and the Trump administration's relationship with Russia. 

END OF SUMMARY.
