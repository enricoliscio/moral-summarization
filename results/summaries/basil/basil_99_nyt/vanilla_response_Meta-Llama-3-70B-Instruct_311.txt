SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the completion of Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff refused to step down, citing the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise and wrongdoing by President Trump and his campaign. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his work as chairman, while Republicans accused him of chasing after Russian collusion. The hearing highlighted the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate Trump's conduct and Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution for the president. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has continued its Russia investigation in a more bipartisan and low-key manner.

END OF SUMMARY.
