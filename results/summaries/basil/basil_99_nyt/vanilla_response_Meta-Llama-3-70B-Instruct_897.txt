SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the release of the Mueller report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his position and promoting false information. Schiff refused to step down, citing concerns over President Trump's campaign's conduct with Moscow. Democrats backed Schiff, saying they will continue to investigate evidence of foreign compromise. The hearing highlighted the deep partisan divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution for Trump and Democrats determined to uncover wrongdoing. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has continued its own Russia investigation in a more bipartisan manner. The House hearing also saw Trump intervene, accusing Schiff of lying and leaking, and Democrats praising Schiff as "calm, professional, and patriotic."

END OF SUMMARY.
