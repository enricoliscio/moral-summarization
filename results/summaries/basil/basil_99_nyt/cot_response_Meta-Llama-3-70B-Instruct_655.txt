SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election turned into a bitter clash between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of being "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic" for not accepting Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report. Schiff refused to step down, calling the president's actions "corrupt" and vowing to continue the committee's investigation. Democrats backed Schiff, praising him as "calm, professional, patriotic", while Republicans accused him of spreading "false" information and damaging the integrity of the committee. The episode highlighted the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to uncover the truth and Republicans embracing the Mueller report's findings as absolution for President Trump.
