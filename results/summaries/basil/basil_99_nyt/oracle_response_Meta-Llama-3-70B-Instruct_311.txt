SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election turned acrimonious as Republicans demanded the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused to step down, citing the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise and condemning the Trump campaign's "nefarious conduct" with Moscow as "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his "calm, professional, patriotic" leadership, while Republicans accused him of "chasing after Russian collusion" and "abusing" his position. The hearing laid bare the bitter divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to expose the "pattern of wrongdoing" by Trump and his administration, and Republicans embracing Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report as absolution for Trump. The committee's investigation will continue, despite Republican attempts to discredit Schiff and undermine the committee's work.

END OF SUMMARY.
