Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to get a good understanding.

The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Robert Mueller completed his report. It started with Republicans demanding the resignation of the chairman, Adam Schiff. The tension was high because of the ongoing divide in Congress about the Mueller investigation. Republicans compared Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, which is a strong move. Schiff defended his position and criticized the Trump administration's actions regarding Russia. Democrats support him, while Republicans are upset, saying Mueller cleared Trump. There's a lot of back and forth, with Trump even weighing in on Twitter. The hearing was supposed to focus on Russia's 2016 intervention, but it turned into a partisan fight. The Senate is handling things more quietly, which contrasts with the House's drama.

So, the key points are: the hearing started with Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation, the tension reflects the ongoing divide in Congress, Schiff criticized Trump's actions, Democrats support him, Republicans are angry, Trump intervened, and the Senate is handling their investigation more calmly.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main events, the conflict between parties, and the contrast with the Senate. Make sure it's clear and concise, capturing the essence without too much detail.
