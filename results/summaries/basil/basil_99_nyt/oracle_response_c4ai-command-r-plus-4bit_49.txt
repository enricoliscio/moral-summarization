SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by acrimony and partisan divide, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff defended his stance, arguing that while Mueller's report may not have found criminal conspiracy, there was ample evidence of immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic conduct by the Trump campaign and administration. He highlighted instances of secret dealings with Russia and lies to the FBI, which he deemed corrupt. Democrats supported Schiff, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and spreading false information. The hearing showcased a sharp contrast between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in their approaches to investigating Russian interference. Outside the hearing, Democrats expressed concern about a pattern of wrongdoing by Trump and his associates, while Republicans accused them of trying to ruin his presidency. The committee's work will continue, but the partisan divide and bitter rhetoric remain obstacles to a unified understanding of the Mueller report and how to move forward.
END OF SUMMARY.
