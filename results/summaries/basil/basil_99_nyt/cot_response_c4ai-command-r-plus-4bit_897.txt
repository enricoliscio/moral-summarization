SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 election was marred by acrimony and partisan bickering, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff, undeterred, outlined a pattern of immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt behavior by President Trump and his associates, including secret dealings with Moscow. Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his position and spreading false information, while Democrats defended him, citing his calm, professional, and patriotic demeanor in contrast to his predecessor, Devin Nunes. The hearing showcased the bitter divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's absolution of Trump and Democrats committed to exposing wrongdoing. The episode stood in contrast to the more measured pace of the Senate Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation, which has continued without the partisan fireworks seen in the House.
END OF SUMMARY.
