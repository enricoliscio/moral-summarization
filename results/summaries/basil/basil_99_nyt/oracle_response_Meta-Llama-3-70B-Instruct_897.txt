SUMMARY:

The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "McCarthyism" and promoting false information. Schiff refused, citing the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise and wrongdoing by President Trump and his campaign. He condemned their conduct as "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic," and vowed to continue the committee's investigative work. Democrats backed Schiff, praising him as "calm, professional, and patriotic." Republicans, on the other hand, were outraged, accusing Democrats of trying to ruin Trump's presidency and turning a blind eye to the Russian threat. The hearing highlighted the deepening divide in Congress, with both sides accusing each other of wrongdoing and corruption.
