SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was marred by acrimony, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff defended his investigation into President Trump's conduct, stating that it is immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. He questioned the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia and efforts to undermine U.S. sanctions. Democrats supported Schiff, while Republicans accused him of abusing his position and promoting false information. The hearing featured experts who warned of Russia's bold efforts to destabilize Western democracies. The Senate Intelligence Committee continues its investigation with a more measured approach, while the House committee faces sharp partisan divisions. The contrasting approaches highlight the stark divide in Congress, with Republicans embracing Mueller's findings and Democrats seeking to uncover further wrongdoing. The article also notes the absence of Devin Nunes, who was accused by Democrats of similar abuses last year.
