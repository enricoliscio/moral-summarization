Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Mueller's report. There's a lot of tension between Republicans and Democrats. The Republicans are demanding Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and promoting false information. Schiff is defending his stance, calling certain actions immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. The Democrats support him, while Republicans are accusing him of wrongdoing.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "fueled," "chasing," "nefarious," "contact," "conferred," "undermining," "lied," "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," "pattern," "wrongdoing," "assertions," "exposed," "abused," "promote," "damaged," "undermined," "actions," "incompatible," "unlawfully," "lying," "leaking," "forced," "investigating," "investigative," "professional," "patriotic," "irresponsible," "criminal," "spread," "conspiracies," "efforts," "destabilize," "underestimating."

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the conflict, the accusations from both sides, and the moral terms used. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including the key moral points.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include the main events and the moral language. I'll mention the Republicans' accusations, Schiff's defense, the Democrats' support, and the broader implications of the hearing. I'll also touch on the contrast with the Senate committee's quieter approach.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and captures the essence of the moral framing without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee's hearing after Robert Mueller's report exposed deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans accused Chairman Adam Schiff of "McCarthyism" and demanded his resignation, alleging he was "chasing" Russian collusion and "abusing" his position to promote false information. Schiff defended his stance, calling certain actions "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt," and emphasized the need to investigate evidence of foreign compromise. Democrats backed Schiff, praising his "professional" and "patriotic" conduct, while Republicans accused him of damaging the committee's integrity and spreading "conspiracies." The hearing highlighted the ongoing conflict over Mueller's findings, with Democrats focusing on a "pattern" of "wrongdoing" and Republicans asserting Trump's innocence. The confrontation underscored the partisan divide and the broader implications of Russia's efforts to "destabilize" Western democracies. END OF SUMMARY.
