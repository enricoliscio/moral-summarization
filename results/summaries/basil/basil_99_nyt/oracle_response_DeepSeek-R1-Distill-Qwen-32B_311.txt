Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the moral terms used.

The article describes a heated hearing in the House Intelligence Committee after Mueller's report. Republicans demanded Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and corruption. Schiff defended his stance, calling certain actions by Trump's associates immoral and unethical. The hearing highlighted the deep divide in Congress over the Russia investigation. The author uses words like "fueled," "nefarious," "immoral," "corrupt," etc., which I need to include in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to include the key events: the hearing, the accusations from Republicans, Schiff's defense, the moral terms used, and the contrast with the Senate's approach. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include as many moral words as possible without making it too long.

Let me start drafting: The hearing was tense with Republicans accusing Schiff of McCarthyism and corruption. Schiff argued that certain actions were immoral and unethical. The committee's work continues, but there's a clear divide. The Senate is more bipartisan. I'll incorporate the moral terms like "nefarious," "immoral," "corrupt," "chasing," "undermining," etc.

Now, I'll make sure the summary flows well and includes all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The House Intelligence Committee hearing, following Robert Mueller's report, was marked by intense partisanship. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of McCarthyism and corruption, while Schiff defended his stance, labeling certain Trump associates' actions as "immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic." The hearing highlighted the deep divide in Congress over the Russia investigation, with Democrats vowing to continue their probe despite Republican claims of exoneration. Schiff emphasized the "nefarious conduct" and "wrongdoing" by Trump's associates, while Republicans accused him of "abusing his position" and "damaging the committee's integrity." The showdown underscored the ongoing conflict over the Russia probe, with Democrats asserting their commitment to justice and Republicans accusing them of "irresponsible" tactics. The Senate's more bipartisan approach contrasted with the House's acrimony. END OF SUMMARY.
