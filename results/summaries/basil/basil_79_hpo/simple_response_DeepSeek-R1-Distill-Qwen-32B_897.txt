Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump mentions that Flynn's life was ruined because he lied to the FBI, while Clinton lied multiple times and faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty in Mueller's investigation, which is about possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and his lawyers are arguing that he can't obstruct justice because he's the president, and they're using this to defend Trump's actions regarding Flynn and the FBI.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be about fairness and justice. Trump is highlighting a double standard where Flynn's actions led to severe consequences, while Clinton's didn't. This comparison is meant to show that the treatment was unfair. Also, the article touches on the implications for Trump himself, suggesting that Flynn's case makes it harder for Trump to distance himself from the investigation, possibly implying potential wrongdoing on Trump's part.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral aspect. I should mention Trump's defense of Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, the consequences for Flynn, and the implications for Trump's own situation. Also, include Dowd's argument about the president's role in justice.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's defense and the comparison, then move on to Flynn's guilty plea and its implications. Finally, I'll mention Dowd's legal argument about the president's role.
