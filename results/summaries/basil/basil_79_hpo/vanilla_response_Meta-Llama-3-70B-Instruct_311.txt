SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" because he lied to the FBI, while Clinton lied many times and faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump's defense of Flynn raises questions about whether he obstructed justice in the investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer and has the right to express his view on any case.
