SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, by invoking Hillary Clinton and her email scandal. Trump lamented that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and that it is a "shame" Flynn was charged while Clinton was not. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Flynn's indictment makes it difficult for Trump to distance himself from the probe. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, claimed that Trump cannot be guilty of obstructing justice as he is the president and has the right to express his views. Trump's statements about the FBI investigation and his firing of James Comey have raised questions of obstruction of justice. END OF SUMMARY.
