SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and "destroyed" due to lying to the FBI, while Clinton "lied many times" and faced no consequences. Trump's defense of Flynn raises questions about his own involvement in the investigation, as Flynn's indictment makes it difficult for Trump to "distance" himself from the probe. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials, including discussing sanctions and creating a backchannel with the Kremlin. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer. However, this defense is questionable, as Trump previously admitted to firing FBI Director James Comey with the Russia investigation in mind.
