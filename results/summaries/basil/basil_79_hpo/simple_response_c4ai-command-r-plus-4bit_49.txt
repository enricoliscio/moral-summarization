SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe, by invoking Hillary Clinton and claiming she "lied many times to the FBI." Trump argued that Clinton faced no consequences while Flynn's life was "ruined." Trump's comments renew questions about possible obstruction of justice, as he previously fired FBI Director James Comey and requested an end to the Flynn investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, claimed the president cannot obstruct justice, as he is the chief law enforcement officer. This defense is questionable, as it implies the president is above the law and immune to consequences for potentially illegal actions. Trump's attempt to shift blame and justify Flynn's actions by comparing them to Clinton's alleged lies is a distraction from the gravity of Flynn's guilty plea and the ongoing investigation into Trump's campaign. It reflects a lack of moral responsibility and respect for the law, suggesting that political power should shield individuals from legal consequences.
END OF SUMMARY.
