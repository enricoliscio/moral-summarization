SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" because he lied to the FBI, while Clinton lied many times and nothing happened to her. Trump's comments sparked questions about his potential role in obstructing justice, as Flynn's indictment makes it harder for Trump to distance himself from the investigation. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claimed that the president already knew about Flynn's lies, and Dowd argued that Trump cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer. This defense has been met with skepticism, as it raises concerns about the president's abuse of power.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump's defense of Flynn is hypocritical and potentially corrupt. By invoking Clinton's situation, Trump is attempting to deflect attention from his own administration's wrongdoing. The article implies that Trump's actions may be motivated by a desire to protect himself and his associates, rather than upholding justice and accountability.
