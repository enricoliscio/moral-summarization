SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion with Russia. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming that she "lied many times to the FBI" without consequences, while Flynn's life has been ruined and destroyed due to lying. Trump's comments renew questions about his potential obstruction of justice, as he previously admitted to firing FBI Director James Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind and requested an end to the Flynn investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer. Trump's statements and Dowd's defense highlight a moral framing of the issue, with words like "ruined," "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," "lying," "collusion," "charges," "misled," "contacts," "sanctions," "backchannel," "knew," "fired," and "end" conveying a sense of ethical implications and potential wrongdoing.

END OF SUMMARY.
