SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and expressed sympathy for the damage done to his life. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, have raised questions about possible obstruction of justice by the president, who has the power to express his views on any case as the chief law enforcement officer. Trump's comments and Dowd's defense renew focus on the investigation and the president's possible involvement. This development highlights the ethical implications of the case, with Trump's actions being described as a "shame" and raising questions of guilt and obstruction.
