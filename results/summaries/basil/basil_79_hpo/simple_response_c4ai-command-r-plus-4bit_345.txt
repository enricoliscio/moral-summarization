SUMMARY: President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking Hillary Clinton and claiming unfair treatment in comparison. Trump stated that Flynn's life has been ruined due to his guilty plea for lying to the FBI, while Clinton faced no consequences for her alleged lies. Trump's comments renew questions about his possible obstruction of justice, as he previously admitted to firing FBI Director James Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, introduced a new defense, arguing that the president, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot obstruct justice. This defense raises moral and ethical concerns about the president's understanding of his role and responsibilities. Trump's comments also demonstrate a disregard for the integrity of the justice system, suggesting that different standards should be applied based on political affiliation. It is important to uphold the principle that no one is above the law and that equal treatment under the law is a fundamental aspect of a fair and just society.

END OF SUMMARY.
