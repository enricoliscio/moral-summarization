Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump feels sorry for Flynn, whose life was ruined after lying to the FBI. He points out that Clinton lied to the FBI too but didn't face consequences, while Flynn did. 

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying in the Mueller investigation, making him the first Trump admin official charged. Trump and the White House have always said the investigations don't involve Trump, but Flynn's case complicates that. Flynn resigned in February after admitting he misled the transition team about his contacts with Russia.

Now, Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, say Trump knew about Flynn's lies, which brings up obstruction of justice questions. Trump fired Comey, mentioning the Russia probe, and Comey testified that Trump asked him to stop the Flynn investigation. Dowd argues Trump can't obstruct justice because he's the chief law enforcement officer.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump defending Flynn by comparing him to Clinton. Mention Flynn's guilty plea and its implications. Then touch on the obstruction questions and Dowd's defense. Keep it concise and clear.
