SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while Clinton lied to the FBI multiple times and faced no consequences. Flynn's guilty plea is part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and the White House have tried to distance themselves from the investigation, but Flynn's indictment makes it harder for them to do so. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, is now claiming that Trump isn't guilty of obstructing justice because as president, he is the chief law enforcement officer and has the right to express his views on any case.

END OF SUMMARY.
