Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the content. The article talks about Trump defending Michael Flynn, comparing his situation to Hillary Clinton's. Trump mentions that Flynn's life was ruined because he lied, while Clinton lied but faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, which is part of Mueller's investigation. Trump's team is arguing that he can't obstruct justice because he's the president. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. Words like "ruined," "lied," "unfair," "dishonest," "justified," "obstructed," "culpable," and "fairness" stand out. These words carry moral judgments about the actions and outcomes.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these terms while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating Trump's defense of Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, Flynn's guilty plea, and the implications for Trump. Then, mention the argument that the president can't obstruct justice. I'll make sure to include the moral words to maintain the original framing.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be brief but cover all key points. Let me structure it: Trump defends Flynn, compares to Clinton, Flynn's lie leading to ruin, Mueller's investigation, Trump's distancing, and the legal argument about obstruction. I'll ensure each moral word is included where appropriate.

Double-checking the word count, I think it's around 190 words, so that's good. The summary should flow naturally while highlighting the moral aspects as presented in the article.

**SUMMARY:**
President Donald Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn’s life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump contrasted Flynn’s situation with Hillary Clinton’s, claiming Clinton lied to the FBI but faced no consequences, while Flynn’s lie destroyed his life, calling it "unfair." Flynn’s guilty plea in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia complicates Trump’s efforts to distance himself from the probe. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, argue that Trump cannot be accused of obstructing justice because, as president, he is the chief law enforcement officer and has the right to express his views on cases. The summary highlights the moral framing of the situation, emphasizing the unfairness and dishonesty involved. END OF SUMMARY.
