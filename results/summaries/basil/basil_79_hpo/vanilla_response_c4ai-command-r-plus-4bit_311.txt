SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been ruined and compared his situation to that of Hillary Clinton, who was investigated for her use of a private email server but faced no charges. Trump's comments renew questions about possible obstruction of justice, as he previously admitted to firing FBI Director James Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot obstruct justice as he is the chief law enforcement officer under the Constitution. Trump's statements and Dowd's defense come as Flynn's indictment brings the Russia probe closer to the president.
END OF SUMMARY.
