Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by talking about President Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump says he feels bad for Flynn because his life was ruined, while Clinton lied to the FBI and nothing happened to her. This seems to set up a moral contrast between the two, suggesting unfair treatment.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, which is part of Mueller's investigation. Trump and his team have been claiming the investigations don't involve him, but Flynn's case makes it harder for Trump to stay separate from the probe. Flynn had to step down because he lied about his contacts with Russian officials.

Now, Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, say Trump knew about Flynn's lies, which brings up questions about obstruction of justice. Earlier, Trump fired Comey, and Comey testified that Trump asked him to stop the Flynn investigation. Dowd is now arguing that Trump can't obstruct justice because he's the president, implying he has the right to influence the investigation.

So, the moral framing here is about fairness and justice. Trump is criticizing the treatment of Flynn compared to Clinton, implying that the justice system is biased. He's also defending his actions, suggesting that his position as president gives him immunity from obstruction charges.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral angle. I'll mention Trump's defense of Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, the implications for Trump's own involvement, and the legal defense from Dowd about presidential immunity. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

Let me structure this: Start with Trump defending Flynn, mention the comparison to Clinton, explain Flynn's guilty plea and its impact on Trump's position, then touch on the obstruction of justice claims and Dowd's defense. Make sure to highlight the moral points about fairness and the president's role in justice.

I think that covers all the key points while preserving the moral framing. Time to put it together concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump defended Michael Flynn, stating his life was ruined after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while criticizing the lack of consequences for Hillary Clinton, who also lied to the FBI. Flynn's case implicates Trump, as Flynn misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim Trump knew of Flynn's lies, raising questions of obstruction of justice. Trump previously fired FBI Director Comey, who testified Trump asked him to halt the Flynn investigation. Dowd argues Trump, as president, cannot obstruct justice. The comparison highlights a perceived unfairness in how Flynn and Clinton were treated, while Flynn's case complicates Trump's efforts to distance himself from the Russia probe. END OF SUMMARY.
