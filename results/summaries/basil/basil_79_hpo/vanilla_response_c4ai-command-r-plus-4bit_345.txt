SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been ruined and compared his situation to that of Hillary Clinton, who was investigated for her use of a private email server but faced no charges. Trump's comments come amid questions of possible obstruction of justice, as he and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim that Trump already knew about Flynn's lies to the FBI. Dowd also argued that Trump, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot obstruct justice. Flynn's indictment and Trump's comments make it difficult for the president to distance himself from the Russia investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
