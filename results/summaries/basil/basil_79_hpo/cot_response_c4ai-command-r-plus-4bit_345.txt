SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has come to the defense of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, claiming that his life has been "ruined" and that it is a "shame" compared to Hillary Clinton, who "lied many times to the FBI" without consequences. This incident has raised questions about Trump's possible obstruction of justice, as he and his lawyer, John Dowd, revealed that the President knew about Flynn's lies. Dowd defended Trump by arguing that the President, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot obstruct justice. Trump's statements and actions have made it difficult for him to distance himself from the investigation. This incident highlights the moral dilemma of fairness, justice, and the misuse of power, with Trump's actions being deemed *wrong* by some.
