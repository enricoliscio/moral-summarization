SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" because he lied to the FBI, whereas Clinton lied multiple times and faced no consequences. Trump's defense of Flynn raises questions about his own involvement in the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is the first former administration official to face charges in the probe. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that Trump cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because as president, he is the chief law enforcement officer and has the right to express his views on any case. This defense is morally questionable, as it implies that the president is above the law.

END OF SUMMARY.
