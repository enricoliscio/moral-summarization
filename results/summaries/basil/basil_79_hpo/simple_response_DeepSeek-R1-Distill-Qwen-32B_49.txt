Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, the article is about Trump defending Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. I need to make sure the summary captures that comparison and the underlying moral points. 

First, I should identify the key points: Trump feels sorry for Flynn, points out the double standard between Flynn's treatment and Clinton's, mentions Flynn's guilty plea, and the implications for Trump's own involvement. Also, Trump's lawyer's argument about the president's authority is important.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's defense of Flynn, then the comparison to Clinton. Next, mention Flynn's guilty plea and its impact on Trump's position. Then, touch on the implications of Trump knowing about Flynn's lies and the lawyer's defense. Finally, note the ongoing questions about obstruction of justice.

I should make sure the moral framing is clear—Trump is highlighting unfair treatment, suggesting a double standard, and his lawyer is arguing presidential immunity. I need to present this without bias, just summarizing the facts and the moral arguments presented.

Let me structure it step by step: Trump defends Flynn, compares to Clinton, Flynn's plea, Trump's connection, lawyer's defense, and ongoing issues. That should cover all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn’s life was “ruined” after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump compared Flynn’s treatment to Hillary Clinton, who faced no consequences despite allegedly lying to the FBI about her private email server. Trump argued that Flynn’s fate was “unfair,” while Clinton’s lies went unpunished. Flynn’s guilty plea in the Mueller investigation has complicated Trump’s efforts to distance himself from the probe. Flynn had misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, leading to his resignation in February. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim Trump knew about Flynn’s lies but argue that as president, Trump cannot obstruct justice. Dowd asserts that the president, as the chief law enforcement officer, has the right to express his views on cases. Trump’s comments and actions continue to raise questions about potential obstruction of justice. END OF SUMMARY.
