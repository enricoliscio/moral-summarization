SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while Clinton lied multiple times to the FBI without consequences. Trump's comments come after Flynn became the first former administration official to face charges in the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. The president's defense of Flynn raises questions about whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation, particularly given his previous statements about firing FBI Director James Comey with the Russia investigation in mind. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, has also claimed that the president cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer.
