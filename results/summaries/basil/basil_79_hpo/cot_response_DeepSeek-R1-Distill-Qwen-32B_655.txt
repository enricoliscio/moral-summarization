Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump mentions that Flynn's life was ruined because he lied, while Clinton lied and nothing happened to her. 

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "defended," "ruined," "lied," "shame," "unfair," "collusion," "indictment," "distance," "misled," "contacts," "sanctions," "backchannel," "Kremlin," "fired," "obstructed," "justice," and "defense." These words carry moral implications, so I should note them down.

Now, for the summary, I have to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral terms as possible. I'll start by stating Trump's defense of Flynn, mention the comparison to Clinton, and note Flynn's guilty plea. Then, I'll touch on Trump's attempts to distance himself and the implications of Flynn's case on Trump's own situation. I'll also include the legal arguments made by Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, about the president's role in justice.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting from Trump's comments, moving to the context of Flynn's case, and then discussing the implications and legal arguments. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the original framing.

Let me check the word count. The summary should be around 200 words. I'll write it out, then count the words to make sure it's within the limit. If it's too long, I'll trim some parts without losing the essential points.

Finally, I'll structure the response by first listing the morally framed words under STEP 1 and then providing the summary under SUMMARY, ending with END OF SUMMARY.

### SUMMARY:
President Trump defended Michael Flynn, stating his life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump compared Flynn's fate to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI about her private email server but faced no consequences. Flynn's case has made it harder for Trump to distance himself from the Russia investigation. Flynn misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, leading to his resignation. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim Trump knew about Flynn's lies but argue the president cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer. The summary highlights the moral framing of "ruined," "lied," "shame," and "unfair," reflecting Trump's criticism of the justice system's treatment of Flynn versus Clinton. END OF SUMMARY.
