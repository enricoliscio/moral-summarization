SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming that she lied to the FBI multiple times without consequences. Trump's comments come as questions arise about his own involvement in the investigation, with his lawyer arguing that the president cannot obstruct justice due to his position as chief law enforcement officer. In the past, Trump has admitted to firing FBI Director James Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind, and Comey testified that Trump requested an end to the Flynn investigation.
