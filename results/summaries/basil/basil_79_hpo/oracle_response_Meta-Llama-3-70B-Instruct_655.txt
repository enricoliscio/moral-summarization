SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and "destroyed" because he lied to the FBI, while Clinton "lied many times" and faced no consequences. Trump's comments sparked questions about fairness and justice, with many seeing his defense of Flynn as "unfair". Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible "collusion" between Trump's campaign and Russia. The indictment has made it difficult for Trump to "distance" himself from the investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer, but this defense has raised eyebrows. The controversy has led to questions about Trump's knowledge of Flynn's actions and whether he "misled" his transition team. END OF SUMMARY.
