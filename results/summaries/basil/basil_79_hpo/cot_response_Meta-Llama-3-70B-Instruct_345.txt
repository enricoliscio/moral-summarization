SUMMARY:
President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump said he felt "badly" for Flynn, whose life has been "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump claimed that Flynn's lie "destroyed his life", which is "very unfair" compared to Clinton, who "lied many times" to the FBI without consequence. This defense comes as Flynn becomes the first former administration official to face charges in the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, also argued that Trump cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president and has the right to express his view of any case. The investigation continues to pose a challenge to Trump's claims of innocence. END OF SUMMARY.
