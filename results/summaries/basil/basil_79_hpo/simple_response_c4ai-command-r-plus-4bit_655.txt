SUMMARY: President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking Hillary Clinton and claiming unfair treatment in comparison. Trump argued that Clinton "lied many times" to the FBI with no consequences, while Flynn's life has been "ruined" for the same offense. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, becoming the first former administration official charged. Trump's comments and his lawyer's defense raise questions about obstruction of justice. Dowd claimed Trump cannot obstruct justice as he is the chief law enforcement officer under the Constitution. This moral framing of "unfairness" and the assertion of presidential immunity from obstruction charges are questionable and have sparked controversy.

END OF SUMMARY.
