Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify the morally framed words. Let me read the article carefully.

The article is about Trump defending Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump says Flynn's life was ruined, implying it's unfair. He mentions Clinton lied to the FBI but nothing happened, while Flynn lied and got destroyed. That's a clear moral comparison, so "lied" and "ruined" are key.

Flynn pleaded guilty, which is a moral failing. The article also mentions the special counsel's investigation, which is about possible collusion, another moral issue. Trump's lawyers are arguing he can't obstruct justice because he's the president, so "obstructed justice" and "right" are important.

I need to list all the single words that carry moral weight. Words like "defended," "ruined," "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," "pleaded guilty," "collusion," "indictment," "distancing," "misled," "contacts," "sanctions," "backchannel," "Kremlin," "fired," "obstructing," "justice," "right," "express," "view," "case."

Now, for the summary. I should include Trump's defense, the comparison, Flynn's guilty plea, the implications for Trump, and the legal arguments. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure to include the moral terms.

I'll start by stating Trump defended Flynn, compare the treatment of Flynn and Clinton, mention the guilty plea, the impact on Trump's distancing, Flynn's misleading, and Trump's legal team's argument about obstruction of justice.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral framing intact.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn’s life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia collusion investigation. Trump compared Flynn’s fate to Hillary Clinton, who "lied many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Flynn’s indictment complicates Trump’s efforts to distance himself from the probe. Flynn had misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, including discussions on sanctions and a backchannel with the Kremlin. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim Trump knew about Flynn’s lies but argue the president cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer under the Constitution. Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey and requests to halt the Flynn investigation have renewed questions about potential obstruction of justice. END OF SUMMARY.
