SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, saying his life has been ruined, and compared his situation to that of Hillary Clinton, who was investigated for her use of a private email server. Trump claimed that Clinton lied to the FBI multiple times without consequences, while Flynn's lie has had severe repercussions. The president's comments come as questions arise about his own potential obstruction of justice in the investigation, particularly in relation to his firing of FBI Director James Comey. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, has argued that the president cannot obstruct justice due to his position as chief law enforcement officer under the Constitution.
