SUMMARY:
President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, saying he feels "very badly" for him and that his life has been "ruined" due to lying to the FBI. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming she "lied many times" to the FBI without consequence. Trump called it a "shame" that Flynn's life was destroyed while Clinton's was not. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer. The defense has raised questions about whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
