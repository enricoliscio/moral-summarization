SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and that it's a "shame" that Flynn lied to the FBI, while Clinton "lied many times" and nothing happened to her. Trump's defense of Flynn raises questions about whether he obstructed justice in the investigation. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, which some argue is an attempt to justify Trump's potential obstruction of justice. Dowd's new defense is that Trump, as the president, cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer. END OF SUMMARY.
