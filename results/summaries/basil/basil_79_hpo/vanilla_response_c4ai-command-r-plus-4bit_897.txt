SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been ruined and compared his situation to that of Hillary Clinton, who was investigated for her use of a private email server but faced no charges. Trump's comments come as questions arise about his own involvement in the investigation, with Trump and his lawyer claiming he cannot obstruct justice as the president. Trump's statements also renew questions about possible obstruction of justice, as he previously admitted to firing FBI Director James Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind and requested that Comey drop the investigation into Flynn.

END OF SUMMARY.
