Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first to understand what it's about. The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Trump compares Flynn's situation to Hillary Clinton's, pointing out that she lied to the FBI but faced no consequences, while Flynn's life was ruined. 

I need to make sure I capture the main points. Trump feels badly for Flynn, mentions Clinton's case, and then there's the context about Flynn's guilty plea and the Mueller investigation. Also, Trump and his lawyer argue that he can't obstruct justice because he's the president. 

I should structure the summary to include Trump's defense, the comparison to Clinton, Flynn's guilty plea, the implications for Trump's distancing from the investigation, and the legal arguments presented. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and factual. 

Let me check the key details: Flynn lied to the FBI, pleaded guilty, and Trump is using Clinton's case to justify why Flynn's situation is unfair. Also, Trump's lawyer brought up the constitutional argument about the president's role in justice. 

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented. Make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's defense, then the context of Flynn's case, and ending with the legal implications. 

I think that's all. Time to put it together in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn’s life was “ruined” after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia collusion probe. Trump compared Flynn’s situation to Hillary Clinton, claiming she lied to the FBI about her private email server but faced no consequences, while Flynn’s lie destroyed his life. Flynn’s guilty plea, the first by a Trump administration official in the Mueller investigation, complicates Trump’s efforts to distance himself from the probe. Flynn had misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, argue that Trump cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer under the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
