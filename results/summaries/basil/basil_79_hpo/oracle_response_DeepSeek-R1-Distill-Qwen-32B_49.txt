Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn and comparing him to Hillary Clinton. The key points are Trump's defense of Flynn, the moral words used like "ruined," "lied," and "unfair," and the context of Flynn's guilty plea and the implications for Trump's involvement.

First, I should identify the main events: Trump defended Flynn, comparing him to Clinton, who lied but faced no consequences, while Flynn's life was ruined. Flynn pleaded guilty, which connects to the Mueller investigation. Trump's team claims he knew about Flynn's lies, raising obstruction of justice questions. Trump fired Comey, who testified about Trump's request to end the Flynn investigation. Dowd argues Trump can't obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer.

I need to include the moral words: ruined, lied, destroyed, unfair, lying, collusion, charges, distance, misled, contacts, sanctions, backchannel, knew, fired, end, express. I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate, keeping it concise under 200 words.

I'll start by stating Trump defended Flynn, using "ruined" and "unfair." Then mention Flynn's guilty plea and the implications. Include Trump's claims of knowing about the lies and the obstruction questions. Mention Comey's firing and Dowd's defense. Make sure each moral term is naturally integrated without forcing them.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all key points with the required terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Make sure it's clear and preserves the moral framing as the author intended.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn’s life was “ruined” after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump compared Flynn’s situation to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI during the investigation into her private email server but faced no consequences. Flynn’s case, however, has drawn attention to potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Trump claimed he knew about Flynn’s lies but argued that as president, he couldn’t obstruct justice. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who testified that Trump had asked him to end the Flynn investigation. Trump’s lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president’s role exempts him from obstruction charges. Flynn’s guilty plea has made it harder for Trump to distance himself from the Russia probe. END OF SUMMARY.
