SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and "destroyed" due to lying to the FBI, while Clinton "lied many times" and faced no consequences. Trump's comments sparked questions about fairness and justice, with the president implying that it's "unfair" that Flynn's life was affected while Clinton's was not. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible "collusion" between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations have nothing to do with Trump himself, but Flynn's indictment makes it increasingly difficult for the president to "distance" himself. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, also raised eyebrows by claiming that the president can't be guilty of obstructing justice because he's the president.

END OF SUMMARY.
