SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while Clinton lied multiple times to the FBI and faced no consequences. Trump's defense of Flynn raises questions about his own involvement in the Russia investigation, as Flynn's indictment makes it harder for Trump to distance himself. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, also claimed that the president cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer. This moral double standard, where Trump and his allies excuse their own wrongdoing while condemning others, is a disturbing trend. It undermines the rule of law and erodes trust in the justice system.

END OF SUMMARY.
