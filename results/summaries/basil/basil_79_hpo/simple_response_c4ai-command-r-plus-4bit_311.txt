SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion with Russia. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been ruined and compared his situation to that of Hillary Clinton, who was not charged for her use of a private email server. Trump's comments and his lawyer's recent statement that the president cannot obstruct justice due to his position raise concerns about obstruction of justice in the investigation. Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and his request to end the Flynn investigation add to these concerns. Trump's defense of Flynn and attempts to distance himself from the Russia probe highlight the moral dilemma of a president abusing his power and evading accountability, while his administration's actions continue to raise ethical and legal questions.
END OF SUMMARY.
