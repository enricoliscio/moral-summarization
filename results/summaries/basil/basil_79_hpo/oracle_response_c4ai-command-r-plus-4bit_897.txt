SUMMARY: President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking Hillary Clinton and claiming unfair treatment. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation, becoming the first former administration official charged. Trump, who knew about Flynn's lying, claims the investigation is unrelated to him, but Flynn's indictment suggests otherwise. Trump's lawyer argued that Trump, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot obstruct justice, despite Trump firing the FBI director over "the Russia thing" and requesting an end to the Flynn investigation. Trump's comments about Clinton's private email server and "many lies" contrast with his defense of Flynn, whose life has been ruined and destroyed by his lies, according to Trump. This raises moral questions about fairness, truth, and accountability.
END OF SUMMARY.
