SUMMARY:
President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, saying he feels "very badly" for Flynn, whose life has been "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump claimed it's a "shame" that Flynn's life was destroyed, while Hillary Clinton, who allegedly "lied many times" to the FBI, faced no consequences. Trump's comments sparked questions about whether he obstructed justice in the investigation, especially after his lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president can't be guilty of obstructing justice because he's the chief law enforcement officer. Dowd's defense raised eyebrows, with many seeing it as an attempt to justify Trump's potential wrongdoing. The controversy surrounding Flynn's indictment and Trump's involvement continues to unfold, with many calling out the president's perceived unfairness and hypocrisy.
