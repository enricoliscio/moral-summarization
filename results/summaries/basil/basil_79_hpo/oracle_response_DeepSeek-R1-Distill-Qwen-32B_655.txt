Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn. Trump says he feels bad for Flynn because his life was "ruined" after lying to the FBI. He compares this to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI about her email server but faced no consequences. Trump thinks it's "unfair" that Flynn was destroyed while Clinton wasn't. 

Flynn pleaded guilty for lying in the Mueller investigation, which is looking into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and his team have been trying to distance themselves from the investigation, but Flynn's case makes it harder. Flynn had misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, including discussing sanctions and creating a backchannel. 

Now, Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim Trump knew about Flynn's lies, which brings up questions about obstruction of justice. Trump fired Comey, mentioning the Russia investigation, and Comey testified that Trump wanted the investigation into Flynn stopped. Dowd argues that as president, Trump can't obstruct justice because he's the chief law enforcement officer.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words like "ruined," "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," "lying," "collusion," "charges," "distance," "misled," "contacts," "sanctions," "backchannel," "knew," "fired," "end," "express."

So, the summary should highlight Trump's defense of Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, Flynn's guilty plea, the implications for Trump's involvement, and Dowd's defense. I'll structure it to include all these points concisely, using the moral terms as much as possible.
