Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. 

The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump mentions that Flynn's life was "ruined" because he lied to the FBI, while Clinton lied but faced no consequences. This comparison highlights a perceived unfairness. 

I should note the morally charged words used: ruined, lied, destroyed, unfair, lying, collusion, charges, distance, misled, contacts, sanctions, backchannel, knew, fired, end, express. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

Next, I'll outline the main events: Flynn's guilty plea, Trump's defense, the implications for Trump's distancing from the investigation, Flynn's misleading the transition team, and Trump's potential obstruction of justice. Also, Trump's lawyer's argument that the president can't obstruct justice because of his role.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Trump's defense, the comparison to Clinton, Flynn's situation, and the implications for Trump. Then, I'll touch on the legal aspects and the lawyer's argument.

I should make sure to include words like "ruined," "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," "collusion," "charges," "distance," "misled," etc. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's comments, moving to Flynn's case, and then the implications and legal defense.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key moral points are included. I'll make sure the summary is clear and accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral elements.

SUMMARY: President Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn’s life was "ruined" due to his lies to the FBI, while comparing him to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump criticized the unfair treatment of Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying in the Russia collusion probe. Flynn’s indictment complicates Trump’s efforts to distance himself from the investigation. Flynn had misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, including discussions on sanctions and a backchannel with the Kremlin. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, claim Trump knew about Flynn’s lies, renewing questions of potential obstruction of justice. Trump previously admitted firing FBI Director James Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind, and Comey testified that Trump sought to end the Flynn investigation. Dowd argued that Trump, as president, cannot obstruct justice, as he is the chief law enforcement officer under the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
