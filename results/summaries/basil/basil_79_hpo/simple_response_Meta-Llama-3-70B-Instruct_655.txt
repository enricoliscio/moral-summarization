SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" because he lied to the FBI, whereas Clinton lied multiple times and faced no consequences. Trump's comments sparked questions about his own involvement in the investigation, as Flynn's indictment makes it harder for the president to distance himself. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer, implying that Trump has the right to influence investigations.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump is attempting to deflect attention from his own potential wrongdoing by shifting the focus to Clinton's past mistakes. This tactic is morally questionable, as it seeks to distract from the current investigation and undermine the rule of law. Additionally, Dowd's defense of Trump's actions raises concerns about the president's abuse of power and potential obstruction of justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
