Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump feels bad for Flynn because his life was ruined, while Clinton lied to the FBI but nothing happened to her. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, which is part of Mueller's investigation. Trump and his team have been saying the investigations don't involve him, but Flynn's case makes that harder. Flynn had contacts with Russian officials and misled the transition team. Trump fired Comey, who was investigating Flynn, and now Trump's lawyer is saying Trump can't obstruct justice because he's the president.

The moral framing seems to be about fairness and justice, comparing how Flynn was treated versus Clinton. Trump is highlighting the double standard, implying that Flynn was unfairly treated compared to Clinton. The article also touches on Trump's possible obstruction of justice and his lawyer's defense.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: Trump's comparison, Flynn's guilty plea, the implications for Trump, the contacts with Russia, Trump firing Comey, and the legal defense. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral comparison is clear.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump defending Flynn by comparing to Clinton. Mention Flynn's guilty plea and its impact on Trump's case. Include the details about Flynn's contacts and misleading the transition team. Then talk about Trump firing Comey and the obstruction of justice claims. Finally, mention Trump's lawyer's argument about the president's immunity.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Also, use concise language to capture all necessary points without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: President Trump defended Michael Flynn, stating that Flynn's life was ruined after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while Hillary Clinton, who also lied to the FBI, faced no consequences. Trump emphasized the unfairness of Flynn's treatment compared to Clinton. Flynn's case complicates Trump's efforts to distance himself from the Russia investigation, as Flynn had misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials. Trump's lawyer argued that as president, Trump cannot obstruct justice, a claim that renews questions about Trump's actions, including firing FBI Director Comey, who was investigating Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
