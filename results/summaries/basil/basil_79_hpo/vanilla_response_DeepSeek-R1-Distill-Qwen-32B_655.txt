Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn. Trump compares Flynn's situation to Hillary Clinton's, saying she lied to the FBI but nothing happened to her, while Flynn's life was ruined. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller's investigation. Trump's team claims he knew about Flynn's lies but argues he couldn't obstruct justice because he's the president. There's mention of Trump firing Comey and Comey's testimony about Trump asking to end the Flynn investigation.

I should structure the summary to include key points: Trump's defense of Flynn, comparison to Clinton, Flynn's guilty plea, Trump's knowledge of Flynn's lies, Dowd's argument about presidential immunity, and the implications for Trump's involvement in the investigation.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all important details without getting too bogged down in specifics.
