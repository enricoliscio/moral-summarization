Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Trump defending Michael Flynn, comparing his situation to Hillary Clinton. Trump feels bad for Flynn, whose life was "ruined" because he lied to the FBI. In contrast, Clinton lied but nothing happened to her, which Trump finds "unfair." Flynn pleaded guilty, making him the first Trump admin official charged in the Mueller probe. Trump and his team have been trying to distance themselves from the Russia investigation, but Flynn's case complicates that. Flynn lied about his contacts with Russian officials, which included discussing sanctions and a backchannel. Trump's lawyer argues that as president, Trump can't obstruct justice because he's the chief law enforcement officer.

I need to include words like "ruined," "lied," "destroyed," "unfair," "lying," "collusion," "charges," "distance," "misled," "contacts," "sanctions," "backchannel," "knew," "fired," "end," "express." 

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's comparison, the consequences for Flynn, the legal implications, and Trump's defense. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words as much as possible without making the summary too long. Let me draft a concise version that hits all these points within 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Trump defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that Flynnâ€™s life was "ruined" due to his lies to the FBI, while criticizing Hillary Clinton for lying to the FBI without facing consequences, calling it "unfair." Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with Russian officials, including discussions on sanctions and a backchannel, becoming the first Trump administration official charged in the Mueller probe. Trump and his lawyer argue that as president, Trump cannot obstruct justice, claiming he "expressed his view" on the investigation. Flynn's case complicates Trump's efforts to distance himself from the Russia probe, as Trump allegedly "knew" about Flynn's lies and fired FBI Director Comey, renewing questions about potential obstruction of justice. END OF SUMMARY.
