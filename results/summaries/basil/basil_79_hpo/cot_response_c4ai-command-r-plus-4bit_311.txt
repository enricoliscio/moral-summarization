SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, by invoking Hillary Clinton and claiming that the FBI investigation into her private email server use resulted in no consequences despite her lying to the FBI multiple times. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life has been "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. The indictment raises questions about Trump's involvement and whether he *obstructed justice*. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that Trump, as the president and chief law enforcement officer, cannot *obstruct justice* and has the right to express his views on any case. Trump's comments and Dowd's defense renew focus on potential *unfair* and immoral actions by the president and his administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
