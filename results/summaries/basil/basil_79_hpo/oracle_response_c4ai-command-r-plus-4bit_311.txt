SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking Hillary Clinton and claiming unfair treatment. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation, becoming the first former administration official charged. Trump, aware of Flynn's lying, faces questions of obstruction of justice. Flynn misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, discussing sanctions and a backchannel. Trump's lawyer argued the president cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, saying his life had been "ruined," while Clinton "lied many times" without consequence. This contrast highlights perceived injustice in the application of justice, raising moral questions about fairness and accountability.
