SUMMARY:
President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" due to lying to the FBI, while Clinton "lied many times" and faced no consequences. Trump called this disparity "very unfair" and a "shame." Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump's defense of Flynn raises questions about whether he obstructed justice in the investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer. This defense is morally dubious, implying that the president is above the law. END OF SUMMARY.
