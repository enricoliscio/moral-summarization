SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking Hillary Clinton and her email scandal. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whose life has been *ruined* due to the charges against him, while contrasting it with Clinton's apparent lack of consequences for her actions. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe, marking the first time a former administration official has faced charges. This development raises questions about Trump's involvement, given his previous knowledge of Flynn's deception. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, have asserted that the president cannot be *guilty* of *obstructing justice* due to his position as the chief law enforcement officer. This defense comes amid previous statements by Trump and Comey indicating Trump's desire to end the investigation into Flynn. Critics view these actions as an attempt to *obstruct justice*.
END OF SUMMARY.
