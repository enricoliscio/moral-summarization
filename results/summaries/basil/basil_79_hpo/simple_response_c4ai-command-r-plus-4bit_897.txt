SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion with Russia. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been ruined and compared his situation to that of Hillary Clinton, who he alleges lied to the FBI without consequence. Trump's comments renew questions about possible obstruction of justice by the president, as he and his lawyer, John Dowd, now admit that Trump knew about Flynn's lies. Dowd argues that Trump, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot obstruct justice. This moral framing, which justifies Trump's actions and shifts blame to Clinton, requires careful consideration in the context of the ongoing investigation and raises concerns about the integrity of justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
