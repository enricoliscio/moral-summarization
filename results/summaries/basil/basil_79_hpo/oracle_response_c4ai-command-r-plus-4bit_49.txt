SUMMARY: President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion with Russia. Trump invoked Hillary Clinton, claiming she "lied many times to the FBI" without consequence, while Flynn's life has been ruined and destroyed due to his lie. Trump's comments renew questions about his potential obstruction of justice, as he previously fired FBI Director James Comey and requested an end to the Flynn investigation. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer. Trump's knowledge of Flynn's lying before his dismissal raises further concerns. Flynn's indictment distances Trump from his claim of no involvement in the campaign investigations. Flynn misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials, including discussions on sanctions and a backchannel. Trump's defense of Flynn and criticism of Clinton highlight his views on fairness.
END OF SUMMARY.
