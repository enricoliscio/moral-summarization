SUMMARY:

President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and "destroyed" due to lying to the FBI, whereas Clinton "lied many times" and nothing happened to her. Trump called it "unfair" that Flynn's lie led to charges, while Clinton's lies went unpunished. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible "collusion" between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations have nothing to do with Trump himself, but Flynn's indictment makes it difficult for Trump to "distance" himself. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that Trump can't be guilty of obstructing justice because he's the president, but this raises questions about Trump's actions, including firing FBI Director James Comey and requesting that Comey put an end to the investigation into Flynn.

END OF SUMMARY.
