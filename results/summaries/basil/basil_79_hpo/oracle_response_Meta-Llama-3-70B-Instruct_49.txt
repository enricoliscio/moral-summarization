SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton, and claiming that Flynn's life has been "ruined" and "destroyed" due to lying to the FBI. Trump argued that it's "unfair" that Flynn faced charges while Clinton, who "lied many times" to the FBI, faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation into possible "collusion" between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations have nothing to do with Trump himself, but Flynn's indictment makes it increasingly difficult for the president to "distance" himself. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, claimed that the president isn't guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president, and has every right to "express" his view of any case.

END OF SUMMARY.
