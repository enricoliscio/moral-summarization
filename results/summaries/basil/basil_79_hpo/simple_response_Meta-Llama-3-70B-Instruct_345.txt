SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while Clinton lied multiple times and faced no consequences. Trump's comments sparked questions about his involvement in the investigation, as Flynn's indictment makes it harder for Trump to distance himself. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president knew about Flynn's lies, which raises concerns about obstruction of justice. Dowd even argued that Trump, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot be guilty of obstructing justice. This moral double standard, where Trump's allies are defended while his opponents are criticized, is striking. The president's actions and words undermine the rule of law and create a sense of unfairness.

END OF SUMMARY.
