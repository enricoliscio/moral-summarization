SUMMARY: President Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and expressed sympathy for the damage done to Flynn's life as a result of the investigation. Trump drew a comparison to Hillary Clinton, claiming that while she lied to the FBI multiple times, she faced no consequences, whereas Flynn's life was ruined by a single lie. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion with Russia, becoming the first former administration official charged. Trump's comments renew questions about his knowledge of Flynn's actions and possible obstruction of justice. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argued that the president cannot obstruct justice as the chief law enforcement officer. This defense raises ethical concerns about the potential abuse of presidential power. Flynn's actions, including his misleading of the transition team and discussions with Russian officials about sanctions and backchannels, are also ethically questionable. The investigation continues to cast a shadow over the administration, making it difficult for Trump to distance himself from the probe.
END OF SUMMARY.
