SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by comparing his situation to that of Hillary Clinton. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, while Clinton lied multiple times to the FBI without consequence. Flynn's indictment makes it difficult for Trump to distance himself from the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, raising questions of whether Trump obstructed justice. Dowd also argued that Trump cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president and has the right to express his view on any case.

END OF SUMMARY.
