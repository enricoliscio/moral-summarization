Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump defending Michael Flynn by comparing him to Hillary Clinton. Trump feels bad for Flynn, whose life was ruined, while Clinton lied to the FBI and nothing happened to her. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the Mueller investigation, making him the first Trump administration official charged. Trump and his team are trying to distance themselves from the investigation, but Flynn's case makes it harder. Flynn resigned after admitting he misled the transition team about his contacts with Russian officials. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, argues that the president can't obstruct justice because he's the chief law enforcement officer. Trump also mentioned firing Comey with "this Russia thing" in mind, and Comey testified that Trump asked him to stop the Flynn investigation.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's defense of Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, Flynn's guilty plea, the impact on Trump's position, Flynn's resignation details, Trump's firing of Comey, and Dowd's legal argument. I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is included without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: Trump defends Flynn, comparing him to Clinton. Flynn's guilty plea, first in Mueller's probe. Trump's difficulty in distancing himself. Flynn's resignation due to misleading the transition team. Trump's firing of Comey and Comey's testimony. Dowd's argument about Trump's immunity from obstruction charges.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all main points without being too wordy. Let me check the word count as I write to stay under 200.
