Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, specifically using the words "violence" and "threats." I should start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Kathy Griffin posing with a fake bloody head of Trump. She's known for shocking content, and this time it's a photo shoot that's causing a stir. The author mentions it's like a "horribly wrong" America's Next Top Model challenge. She's been pushing boundaries before, but this is new. The photographer's rep says she went above and beyond, hoping she stays out of jail.

Griffin defends it as art, inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She tweeted that she doesn't condone violence but mocks the "Mocker in Chief." Later, she apologized, saying she went too far. The Secret Service responded, saying they monitor threats and investigate them.

I need to include the moral words: violence and threats. So, I should mention her using a fake head to mock Trump, the Secret Service's response about threats, and her defense against violence.

I should structure the summary to highlight the controversy, her actions, the response, and her apology. Keep it under 200 words, using the key terms. Let me draft that.
