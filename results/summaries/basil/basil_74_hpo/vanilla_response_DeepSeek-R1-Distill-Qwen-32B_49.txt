Alright, I need to summarize this article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photos. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot where she's holding a bloody Trump head. It's by Tyler Shields. She's known for shocking people before, like with Lindsay Lohan and Anderson Cooper. The article mentions that her rep hopes she stays out of jail, which is a strong statement. 

She claims it's art, inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She tweeted that she doesn't condone violence but does condone mocking Trump. Then she issued a formal apology, saying she went too far. 

The Secret Service also responded, saying they monitor threats, which is a big deal. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll include the main points: the photo, her apology, the inspiration, and the Secret Service's response. Keep it concise and clear.
