SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for her provocative humor, sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody, severed head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, were met with widespread criticism, with many condemning the depiction of violence. Griffin initially defended the photo, calling it an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's own controversial comments about Megyn Kelly. However, she later issued a formal apology on Twitter, admitting she "went way too far" and does not condone violence in any way. The U.S. Secret Service also responded, stating that threats made against their protectees, including the President, receive the highest priority of all their investigations. The incident highlights the importance of responsible expression and the potential consequences of perpetuating violent imagery. END OF SUMMARY.
