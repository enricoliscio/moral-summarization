Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing, especially focusing on the words "violence" and "threats." The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with a fake bloody Trump head, which caused controversy. She apologized, saying she didn't condone violence but was mocking Trump. The Secret Service responded, indicating they monitor threats.

I should highlight the controversy, the use of a bloody head, her apology, and the Secret Service's response. I need to include the moral aspects, so I'll mention "violence" and "threats" as per the author's framing.

I'll structure the summary to start with the controversy, mention the image, her explanation, the apology, and the Secret Service's reaction. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but include all key elements.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance.
