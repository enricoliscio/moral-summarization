Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields, showing her holding a bloody Trump head. She's known for shocking content, like the Anderson Cooper incident. The article mentions that this went viral and caused controversy. She defended it as art, referencing Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She later apologized, saying she went too far. The Secret Service also responded, showing they take threats seriously.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects. The article frames Griffin's actions as crossing a line, with the Secret Service's response highlighting the potential consequences. The user wants a summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral implications.

I should start by mentioning Griffin's career of shocking content, then the photo details, her defense, the apology, and the Secret Service's involvement. I'll make sure to include that her actions were seen as excessive and that authorities took notice, emphasizing the moral judgment.

Let me structure it: introduce Griffin, describe the photo, her defense, the apology, and the Secret Service's response. Keep it concise and within the word limit. I'll avoid any personal opinions, just present the facts with the moral framing intact.
