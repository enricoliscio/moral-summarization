Okay, I need to summarize the news article about Kathy Griffin's controversial photo shoot. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article again to make sure I capture all the key points.

The article starts by describing the photo shoot where Kathy Griffin holds a bloodied Trump head. It mentions her history of shocking the public, like the Anderson Cooper incident. There's a quote from her representative saying she pushed the limits and hopes she stays out of jail. Then, it explains that the image was inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. Griffin apologized on Twitter, saying she went too far, but still condones mocking Trump. The Secret Service responded, monitoring the situation.

I should make sure the summary includes the controversy, her explanation as art, her apology, and the Secret Service's response. I need to keep it under 200 words and in a concise manner. Also, I should maintain the moral elements, like the potential consequences and the debate over free speech versus safety.

Let me structure it: start with the controversy, mention the inspiration, her apology, and the Secret Service's involvement. Make sure to highlight that she doesn't condone violence but uses art for mocking. Keep the tone neutral but include the moral implications.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all necessary points.
