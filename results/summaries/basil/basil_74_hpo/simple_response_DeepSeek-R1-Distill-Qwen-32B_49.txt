Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin's controversial photo shoot. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

First, the article starts by comparing Kathy Griffin's career to a "Top Model" challenge gone wrong, which sets a negative tone. She's known for shocking her audience, like the Anderson Cooper incident. The main event is the photo where she holds a bloody Trump head, which is described as pushing the limits. The photographer's rep says she went above and beyond, hoping she stays out of jailâ€”this implies potential legal issues, which is a moral concern.

Griffin defends the photo as art, referencing Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She later apologizes on Twitter, saying she went too far but still condones mocking Trump. The Secret Service responds, indicating they're taking it seriously, which adds to the moral implications of her actions.

I need to make sure the summary captures the controversy, the artistic defense, the apology, and the Secret Service's response. Also, the moral framing is about the line between satire and violence. I should keep the language clear but include these elements without exceeding 200 words.

I'll structure it by introducing Griffin's photo, her defense, the apology, the Secret Service's reaction, and conclude with the moral debate. I'll avoid adding my own opinions, just present the facts as per the article's framing.
