SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring a bloody, severed head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, taken by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, have been met with widespread outrage. Griffin claims the photo is an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's past comments about a female journalist. However, she has since issued a formal apology on Twitter, stating "I went way too far." The U.S. Secret Service has also responded, confirming that they are investigating the incident and prioritizing threats made against the President. Griffin's apology comes after facing backlash on social media, with many calling the image inappropriate and offensive. The comedian is known for pushing boundaries, but it seems she may have gone too far this time.
