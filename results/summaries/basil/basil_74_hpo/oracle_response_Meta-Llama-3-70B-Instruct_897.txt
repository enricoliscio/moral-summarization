SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody, severed head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, have been widely condemned, with many calling them an incitement to violence. Griffin initially defended the photo, claiming it was an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. However, she later issued a formal apology on Twitter, stating "I went way too far" and reiterating that she does not condone violence in any way. The U.S. Secret Service has also responded, confirming that they are investigating the incident as a potential threat against the President. The agency emphasized that threats made against their protectees receive the highest priority of all investigations.
