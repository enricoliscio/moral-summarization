SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody, severed head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, have been widely condemned, with many calling them violent and threatening. Griffin initially defended the photos as an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's own comments about Megyn Kelly, but later issued a formal apology, admitting she "went way too far." The U.S. Secret Service has also taken notice, tweeting that threats against their protectees, including the President, receive the highest priority of investigation. Griffin's apology came after widespread backlash, with many criticizing her for promoting violence and condoning threats against the President. The incident has raised questions about the limits of free speech and the responsibility of public figures to avoid promoting harmful or violent rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
