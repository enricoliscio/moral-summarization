SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for pushing boundaries, has sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody head resembling President Donald Trump. The image, intended as an "expression of art," was inspired by Trump's previous comments about Megyn Kelly. Griffin initially defended the photo, saying she was "mocking the Mocker in Chief" and did not condone violence. However, she later issued a formal apology on Twitter, admitting she "went way too far." The U.S. Secret Service responded to the image, stating that threats made against their protectees receive the highest priority of all investigations. The incident highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of one's actions, as Griffin's attempt at satire crossed a line into promoting violence and threats. END OF SUMMARY.
