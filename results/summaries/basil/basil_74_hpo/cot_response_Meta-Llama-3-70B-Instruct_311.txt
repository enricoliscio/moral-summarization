SUMMARY:
Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for pushing the limits and being shocking, has apologized for a controversial photo shoot where she held a fake bloody head of President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, were meant to be an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. However, Griffin took things too far and has since issued a formal apology, stating that she went "way too far" and does not condone violence in any way. The U.S. Secret Service has also responded, stating that threats made against their protectees receive the "highest priority" of all their investigations. Griffin's actions have sparked outrage, with many calling her behavior "wrong" and "horrible." END OF SUMMARY.
