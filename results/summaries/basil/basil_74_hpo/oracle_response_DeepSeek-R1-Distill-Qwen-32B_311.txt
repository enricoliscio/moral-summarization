Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, especially the words "violence" and "threats" that the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot where she's holding a bloodied Trump head. The article mentions it's a "horribly wrong" America's Next Top Model challenge. She's known for shocking people, like the Anderson Cooper incident. The photographer's rep says she pushed the limits and hopes she stays out of jail. The image is supposed to be art, inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. Griffin tweeted she doesn't condone violence but mocks Trump. Then she apologized, saying she went too far. The Secret Service responded, saying they monitor threats and it's a priority.

I need to include the moral words: violence and threats. Also, make sure the summary is under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the controversy, mention the photo, her background, the inspiration, her stance on violence, the apology, and the Secret Service's response. Keep it concise and make sure to highlight the moral aspects without adding my own judgment.
