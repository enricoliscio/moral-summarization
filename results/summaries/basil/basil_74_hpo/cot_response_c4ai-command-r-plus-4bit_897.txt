SUMMARY:
Kathy Griffin has issued an apology for a recent photo shoot in which she held what appeared to be the bloody, severed head of President Donald Trump. The comedian, known for her controversial brand of humor, has faced intense backlash for the images, with many interpreting them as a shocking and wrong endorsement of violence against the President. 

Griffin initially defended the images as an "expression of art," inspired by Trump's own controversial comments about women. However, as the scandal grew, she took to Twitter to apologize, acknowledging that she had gone "way too far" and clarifying that she does not condone violence. 

The U.S. Secret Service also responded to the images, taking to Twitter to assure the public that they are evaluating the situation and take threats against the President with the highest priority. 

Despite Griffin's apology, the incident has sparked debates about the limits of free speech and the moral boundaries of art, with many condemning Griffin's actions as a disturbing example of political mockery gone too far. 

END OF SUMMARY.
