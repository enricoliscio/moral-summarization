SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring her holding a bloody, severed head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, were met with outrage, with many condemning the graphic and violent depiction. Griffin initially defended the photo, calling it an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's past comments about Megyn Kelly. However, she later issued a formal apology on Twitter, stating "I went way too far." The U.S. Secret Service also responded to the image, confirming that they are investigating threats made against the President. Griffin's apology and the Secret Service's response came after widespread backlash against the comedian's provocative stunt.
