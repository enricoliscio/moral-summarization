Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

First, Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for pushing boundaries, did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields. The main image shows her holding a bloody head that looks like Donald Trump. She claims it's an art expression inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She later apologized on Twitter, saying she went too far but doesn't condone violence, only mocking Trump.

Also, the Secret Service responded, saying they monitor threats, which is a bit concerning for her. The article mentions other photos where she's in a leather outfit, but the main focus is on the Trump head image.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the photo shoot, the image of Trump's head, her explanation as art, her apology, and the Secret Service's response.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduce Kathy Griffin and her photo shoot with Tyler Shields.
2. Describe the controversial image of the bloody Trump head.
3. Mention her explanation that it's art inspired by Trump's comments.
4. Note her apology on Twitter, emphasizing she doesn't condone violence.
5. Include the Secret Service's response about monitoring threats.

I should make sure the summary is concise and flows well. Also, I need to end it with the specified tokens. Let me draft it:

"Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for her bold statements, has sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring a fake bloody Donald Trump head. The image, taken by photographer Tyler Shields, was intended as an artistic expression inspired by Trump’s comments about Megyn Kelly. Griffin later apologized on Twitter, stating she went too far but does not condone violence, only mocking Trump. The Secret Service responded, emphasizing their role in monitoring threats. Griffin also shared other photos from the shoot, but the Trump head image remains the focus of public debate."

Wait, that's a bit over. Let me check the word count. Hmm, maybe I can make it more concise.

"Kathy Griffin, known for her provocative humor, sparked controversy with a photo holding a fake bloody Donald Trump head. She claimed it was an artistic response to Trump’s comments about Megyn Kelly. Griffin later apologized, stating she didn’t condone violence. The Secret Service noted they monitor threats. The photo has drawn widespread attention and criticism."

That's better, but I need to include the Twitter apology and the Secret Service response more clearly. Let me try again.

"Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for pushing boundaries, sparked controversy with a photo holding a fake bloody Donald Trump head, claiming it was an artistic response to Trump’s comments about Megyn Kelly. She later apologized on Twitter, stating she didn’t condone violence but aimed to mock Trump. The Secret Service responded, emphasizing their role in monitoring threats, highlighting the image’s potential impact."

That's concise and under 200 words. I think this covers all the main points effectively.
