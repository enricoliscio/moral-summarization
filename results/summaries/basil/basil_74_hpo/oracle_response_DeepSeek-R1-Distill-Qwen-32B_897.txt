Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specifically mentioned that the assistant should be a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, I should focus on the key points and the moral aspects highlighted in the article.

First, I'll read the article carefully. Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot where she held a fake bloody Trump head. The author uses terms like "violence" and "threats," which I need to include. I should make sure these words are in the summary to maintain the moral framing.

The article mentions that Griffin apologized, so that's important. Also, the Secret Service responded, which adds another layer of the moral implications. I need to include that part too.

I should structure the summary to start with Griffin's actions, then her explanation, followed by the apology, and finally the Secret Service's response. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring it flows naturally.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's all. Time to put it together.

SUMMARY:  
Kathy Griffin sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring a bloodied image resembling President Donald Trump's head, taken by photographer Tyler Shields. Griffin defended the artwork as an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly, though she emphasized she does not condone violence. She later apologized, stating she "went way too far." The Secret Service responded, confirming they monitor threats against protectees, highlighting concerns about violence and threats. Griffin's actions drew criticism for crossing boundaries, with some hoping she avoids legal consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
