Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant should be a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I have to make sure I capture the essence and the moral aspects correctly.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot. She's holding a fake bloody Trump head. The author used words like "violence" and "threats," so I need to include those in the summary.

The user wants a concise summary, up to 200 words, using the morally framed words. I should start by identifying the key points: Griffin's photo, the reaction from her rep, her explanation, the Secret Service's response, and her apology.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all these elements. Also, I should mention that she apologized, which shows she acknowledged going too far, tying back to the moral aspect of violence.

I'll structure it by introducing the controversy, her reasoning, the Secret Service's involvement, and her subsequent apology. Keeping it under 200 words while including all necessary details.

Let me draft it out, ensuring I don't miss any important points and that the moral framing is clear. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Kathy Griffin sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring a bloodied image resembling President Donald Trump's head, which she defended as an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's remarks about Megyn Kelly. Griffin's representative noted her tendency to "push the limits," while she herself claimed the work was meant to mock Trump without condoning violence. The Secret Service responded, emphasizing their commitment to monitoring threats against protectees, using the hashtag #ProtectionNeverRests. Griffin later issued a formal apology, acknowledging she had "gone way too far." The incident highlights the tension between artistic expression and the potential for violence or threats, with Griffin's actions drawing widespread criticism and concern.  
END OF SUMMARY.
