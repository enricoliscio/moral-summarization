SUMMARY:
Comedian Kathy Griffin has sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, taken by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, have been deemed "horribly wrong" and "shocking." Griffin claims the photo is an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's past comments, but has since issued a formal apology, stating she "went way too far." The comedian maintains she does not condone violence, but rather aims to "mock the Mocker in Chief." The U.S. Secret Service has responded to the incident, confirming they take threats against the President "very seriously" and will investigate with the "highest priority." Griffin's apology has been met with a mix of criticism and understanding, with many calling her actions "wrong" and "inappropriate." END OF SUMMARY.
