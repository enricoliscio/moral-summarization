SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody, severed head resembling President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, were met with widespread criticism, with many condemning the stunt as going too far. Griffin initially defended the photo, calling it an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's past comments about Megyn Kelly. However, she later issued a formal apology on Twitter, admitting she "went way too far" and does not condone violence. The U.S. Secret Service also responded, stating that they take threats against their protectees, including the President, very seriously and will investigate accordingly. The incident raises questions about the limits of free speech and the morality of using graphic and disturbing imagery to make a point.

END OF SUMMARY.
