SUMMARY:
Kathy Griffin has sparked outrage with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloody head resembling President Donald Trump. The comedian, known for pushing limits, has gone too far this time. The images, shot by Tyler Shields, have been met with widespread criticism, with many calling them "horrible" and "wrong." Griffin initially defended the photo as an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's past comments, but later issued a formal apology, admitting she went "way too far." The U.S. Secret Service has also responded, stating that threats made against the President receive the "highest priority" of all investigations. Griffin's apology comes as a relief, but the incident serves as a reminder to respect boundaries and avoid "mocking" or "condoning" violence. END OF SUMMARY.
