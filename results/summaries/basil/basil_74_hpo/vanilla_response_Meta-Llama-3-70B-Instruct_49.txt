SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring her holding a bloody, fake head of President Donald Trump. The images, taken by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, were meant to be an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. However, Griffin later apologized for the photos, saying she "went way too far" and does not condone violence. The U.S. Secret Service also responded to the images, stating that they take threats against their protectees, including the President, very seriously and will investigate accordingly. Griffin is known for pushing boundaries and shocking the public, but this stunt may have crossed a line. The comedian's apology and the Secret Service's response suggest that the photo shoot may have had unintended consequences.

END OF SUMMARY.
