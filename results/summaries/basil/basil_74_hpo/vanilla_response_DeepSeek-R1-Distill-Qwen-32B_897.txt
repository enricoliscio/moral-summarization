Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for her shocking content, did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields. The photos include her holding a bloodied Trump head, which is pretty intense. There's also mention of other photos where she's posing in a leather outfit by the pool. 

Griffin claims the image is an art expression inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She later apologized on Twitter, saying she went too far but doesn't condone violence. The Secret Service also responded, saying they monitor such threats.

So, the key points are:
1. Kathy Griffin did a controversial photo shoot with a fake bloody Trump head.
2. She says it's art inspired by Trump's comments.
3. She apologized for going too far.
4. The Secret Service responded, emphasizing they monitor threats.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures these points. I should avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main events and reactions.
