SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin has issued an apology for a controversial photo shoot in which she posed with what appeared to be the bloody, severed head of President Donald Trump. While Griffin has stated that the image was intended as an "expression of art" and a mockery of Trump's own controversial comments about women, many have criticized the image as being in poor taste and promoting violence. The photo shoot has even caught the attention of the U.S. Secret Service, who have stated that they take threats against the President very seriously and are investigating the matter. In her apology, Griffin acknowledged that she went too far and that she understands the impact her actions have. She also made it clear that she does not condone violence of any kind and that she is sorry for any distress her actions may have caused. This incident serves as a reminder of the power and influence that public figures can have, and the responsibility they hold to use that influence in a way that does not promote or condone violence or threats against others.
END OF SUMMARY.
