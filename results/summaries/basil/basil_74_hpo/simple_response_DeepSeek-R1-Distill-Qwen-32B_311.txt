Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields where she's holding a bloody Trump head. She says it's art, inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly. She later apologized on Twitter, saying she went too far. The Secret Service responded, monitoring threats.

I should highlight the controversy, her intent as art, the apology, and the Secret Service's reaction. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspects are clearâ€”like the line between art and violence, and the potential consequences.

Make sure to mention the initial shock, her explanation, the apology, and the official response. Also, note that she doesn't condone violence but mocks Trump. Keep the summary balanced, showing both her intent and the backlash.
