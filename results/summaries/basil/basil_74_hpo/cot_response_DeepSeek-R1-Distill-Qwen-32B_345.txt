Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin's controversial photo shoot. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should identify the morally charged words in the text. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about Kathy Griffin making a career out of "shocking" her public, which implies she's pushing boundaries. The photo shows a "bloody head" of Trump, which is described as "controversial." She's "condemned" for "mocking" Trump, and the Secret Service gets involved, which is a "threat." Griffin "apologizes" and says she went "too far," showing she's "regretful." The Secret Service's response is "robust" in monitoring threats.

So the morally framed words are: shocking, controversial, condemned, mocked, threats, apologize, regret, robust.

Now, I need to write a summary that includes these words. I should keep it under 200 words, making sure to capture the essence of the article while highlighting the moral aspects.

I'll start by mentioning the controversy, Kathy Griffin's history of shocking content, the fake head image, the art inspiration, the apologies, and the Secret Service's response. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate.

Let me draft it: Kathy Griffin faced backlash for a controversial photo where she held a fake bloody Trump head, aiming to mock him. She apologized, saying she went too far. The Secret Service responded, showing they take such threats seriously.

That should cover all the key points with the moral framing intact.
