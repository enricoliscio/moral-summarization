SUMMARY: Comedian Kathy Griffin has issued an apology for a controversial photo shoot in which she posed with what appeared to be the bloody, severed head of President Donald Trump. The images, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, have sparked outrage and been interpreted as a potential threat against the president. While Griffin initially defended the photos as an "expression of art" and a mockery of Trump's own controversial comments, she later acknowledged that she "went way too far." The U.S. Secret Service also responded to the images, taking to Twitter to affirm that they take threats against those they protect extremely seriously. Griffin's photos and subsequent apology highlight the ongoing debate surrounding the limits of free speech and artistic expression, particularly when it comes to violent imagery directed at public figures. The incident serves as a reminder that even in the name of art or humor, condoning or alluding to violence is never acceptable and can have serious consequences. 

END OF SUMMARY.
