Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided specific instructions on how to approach it. First, I need to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Kathy Griffin's controversial photo shoot with a fake bloody Trump head. The article mentions her pushing boundaries, shocking the public, and the potential consequences like jail. There's also the Secret Service's response, emphasizing protection and threats.

For the first step, I need to list all the morally charged words. Words like "controversial," "shocking," "pushing the limits," "gory," "condone," "apologizes," "formal apology," "too far," "monitor," "evaluate threats," "highest priority," "protection," and "never rests." These terms carry moral weight because they relate to actions that have consequences or judgments attached.

Now, for the summary, I need to incorporate these words while keeping it concise. I'll start by mentioning Griffin's apology, then the nature of the photos, the inspiration behind them, her clarification, the Secret Service's response, and the public reaction. I should make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

I also need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the controversy, her explanation, the Secret Service's involvement, and the public's mixed reactions. This way, I cover all the key points while preserving the moral framing.

I should double-check that each word from the list is included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding any new information. Also, I need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding any markdown or formatting as per the instructions.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets all the user's requirements and that the moral framing is effectively preserved. This approach should fulfill the user's request accurately and efficiently.
