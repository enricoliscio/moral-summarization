SUMMARY: Comedian Kathy Griffin has sparked controversy with a photo shoot featuring a fake, bloodied head of President Donald Trump. The photos, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, were intended as a statement against Trump's past comments about women, but many found them offensive and disturbing. Griffin initially defended the images as an "expression of art," but later issued a formal apology, stating that she went "way too far." The incident also drew a response from the U.S. Secret Service, which confirmed that threats against those they protect are taken seriously and investigated with the highest priority. The incident has sparked discussions about the limits of free speech and the appropriateness of using violent imagery in political satire.
END OF SUMMARY.
