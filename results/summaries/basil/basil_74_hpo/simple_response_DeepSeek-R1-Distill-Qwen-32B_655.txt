Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. 

Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with a fake bloody Trump head, which is pretty controversial. The article mentions she's known for shocking stunts, so this isn't out of character. She apologized, saying she didn't condone violence but was mocking Trump. The Secret Service responded, which adds a layer of concern about threats.

I should highlight the controversy, her intent to mock, her apology, and the Secret Service's reaction. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to mention the moral aspects, like whether her art justifies the potential harm or if it's crossing a line.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the key points without losing the moral angle. I'll structure it to show her actions, the reaction, her stance, and the consequences she faced.
