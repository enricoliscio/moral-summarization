SUMMARY:
Kathy Griffin has issued an apology for a controversial photo shoot in which she posed with what appeared to be the bloody, severed head of President Donald Trump. The comedian, known for her shocking and controversial brand of humor, initially defended the images as an "expression of art" meant to mock the President. However, as public outrage grew and the U.S. Secret Service took notice, Griffin backtracked and admitted that she had "gone too far." She reiterated that she does not condone violence or threats of any kind, even as a form of mocking the Mocker in Chief. The photo shoot, shot by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, was widely criticized as being in poor taste and offensive. Despite Griffin's initial defense of the images as artistic expression, the backlash prompted her to apologize for her controversial actions. END OF SUMMARY.
