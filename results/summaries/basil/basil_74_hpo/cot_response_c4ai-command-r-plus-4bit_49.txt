SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot in which she held what resembled a bloody head of President Donald Trump. The comedian, known for her shocking stunts, initially claimed the image was an "expression of art" inspired by Trump's controversial comments about a female journalist. However, after facing backlash and even attracting the attention of the U.S. Secret Service, Griffin issued a formal apology, admitting she "went way too far." She reiterated that she does not condone violence and that her intention was to mock the "Mocker in Chief." The U.S. Secret Service took the incident seriously, confirming that threats against those they protect are investigated with the highest priority.
END OF SUMMARY.
