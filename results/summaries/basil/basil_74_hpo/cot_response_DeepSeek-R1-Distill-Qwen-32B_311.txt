Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot where she's holding a bloody Trump head. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "controversial," "shocking," "reveling," "gory," "condone," "apologizes," "condemned," and "monitoring." These words are used to convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these moral words. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the original article's moral framing. I'll make sure to mention Griffin's actions, the reaction from the Secret Service, and her apology, using the identified moral terms where appropriate.

I should also structure the summary clearly, starting with the main event, followed by the reactions and consequences. Keeping it concise but informative is key. I'll ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content and moral perspective.

Griffin, known for pushing boundaries, faced backlash as critics condemned the imagery. She later apologized, stating she "went way too far," while emphasizing she does not condone violence but supports mocking Trump. The U.S. Secret Service also responded, monitoring the situation to ensure threats against protectees were addressed. Griffin's actions drew mixed reactions, with some praising her artistry and others condemning the provocative nature of the photos.
