Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo shoot. The user has provided the article and an example response, so I should follow that structure.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are:

- Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields where she's holding a bloodied Trump head.
- The photos are part of an art project inspired by Trump's comments about Megyn Kelly.
- Griffin initially defended the work as art but later apologized.
- The Secret Service responded, indicating they monitor such threats.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the photo shoot and its content. Then explain the inspiration behind it, Griffin's initial defense, her apology, and the Secret Service's response.

I should ensure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all the main points without unnecessary details. Also, I need to include the updates about her apology and the Secret Service's statement.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure it flows logically from the incident to the reactions and responses. I'll keep each sentence focused on a single point to maintain clarity.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key information is included without any redundancies.
