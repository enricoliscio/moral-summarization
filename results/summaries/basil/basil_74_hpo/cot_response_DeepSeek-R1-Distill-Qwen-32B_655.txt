Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given specific steps: first, identify the morally framed words, then write a summary using those words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Kathy Griffin's controversial photo shoot where she's holding a bloody Trump head. The article mentions her career of shocking the public, Tyler Shields, and the reactions from the Secret Service.

For step one, I need to find all the single words that carry moral implications. Words like "controversial," "shocking," "limits," "gory," "apologizes," "condone," "violence," "mocking," "Mocker," "formal," "statement," "monitor," "threats," "priority," "investigations." These words convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words to maintain the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Griffin's apology, the nature of the photos, her intent as art, the Secret Service's response, and the broader implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, ensuring it flows naturally while preserving the moral elements.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and captures the key points without losing the moral aspects. I'll structure it to show Griffin's actions, the controversy, her defense, the Secret Service's reaction, and the public's mixed feelings. 

I should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral words identified. Also, check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me draft that.

**SUMMARY:**  
Kathy Griffin issued a formal apology after a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloodied Donald Trump head, which sparked widespread outrage. The images, taken by photographer Tyler Shields, were described as an artistic expression inspired by Trumpâ€™s comments about Megyn Kelly. Griffin claimed she does not condone violence but supports mocking the "Mocker in Chief." However, the photos were widely condemned for being gory and excessive. The U.S. Secret Service responded by stating they monitor threats against protectees, emphasizing their priority in investigations. Griffin later apologized, admitting she had gone too far. The incident has reignited debates about free speech, art, and the boundaries of political satire. END OF SUMMARY.
