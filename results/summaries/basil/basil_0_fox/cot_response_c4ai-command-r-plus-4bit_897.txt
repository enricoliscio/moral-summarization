SUMMARY:
Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a rousing keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's *problems*. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his belief in America's affliction. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party accommodating progressives, asking, "What is this? A *circus*?". Beck opened up about his past struggles, stating that life is unfair and sometimes the *bad* guy wins. Beck's speech was the culmination of CPAC, which featured panel discussions and prominent speakers, including potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates. Beck's popularity as a Fox News host has grown alongside the Tea Party Movement, and he launched the 9/12 Project, espousing *values* and *principles* he believes are foundational to America. Attendees, like Cynthia Burgiss, viewed Beck as a leader in the conservative movement and found him *relatable*. She credited him for bringing people of diverse backgrounds together at the 9/12 march in Washington, D.C. Beck's influence extends beyond his show, inspiring a movement that challenges the status quo in Washington.
