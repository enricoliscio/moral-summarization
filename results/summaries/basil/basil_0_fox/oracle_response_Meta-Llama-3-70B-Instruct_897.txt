SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America is suffering from progressivism, not just President Obama. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, stating that "America is an idea that sets people free." Beck shared his troubled past, acknowledging that "life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to CPAC specifically to hear Beck, seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. Beck's popularity coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington, bringing people "together" for a common cause. Beck's message resonated with attendees, who see him as a "relatable... everyday guy" who embodies the idea that America should be a place where people can come together and be "free."
