Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article starts by mentioning that Glenn Beck criticized progressivism at CPAC. He used his chalkboard, which is a prop he often uses on his show. He wrote "Progressivism" on the board to emphasize that it's the root of America's problems. When he asked what America is suffering from, someone in the audience shouted "President Obama," but Beck clarified it's not that simple. He's a critic of Obama, but he's pointing to a bigger issue.

He also rejected the idea that the Republican Party should include progressives, calling it a circus and saying America isn't a clown show. He believes America is an idea that sets people free. Beck talked about his troubled past, saying life isn't fair and sometimes the bad guy wins. This speech wrapped up three days of discussions and high-profile speakers at CPAC, including potential 2012 Republican candidates.

The attendees were there mainly for Beck, seeing him as a leader in the new conservative movement. His popularity has risen alongside the Tea Party Movement and the populist anger towards Washington. He started the 9/12 Project, which outlines nine values and twelve principles he thinks the country was founded on. This project led to a big march in Washington, where people from various backgrounds came together.

A student named Cynthia Burgiss attended the march and saw Beck as a relatable, everyday guy, crediting him for the movement's success.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The key points are Beck's criticism of progressivism, his rejection of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, his belief in America as an idea, his personal message about life not being fair, the significance of CPAC, his role in the conservative movement, the 9/12 Project, and the impact it had.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like Beck's emphasis on progressivism as the root cause, the idea of America as a concept, and the unity he inspired through the 9/12 Project. Also, Cynthia's quote about him being relatable adds to the moral framing by showing his influence on ordinary people.

Let me structure this: Start with Beck's keynote speech at CPAC, his criticism of progressivism, the rejection of expanding the Republican Party, his message about life not being fair, the event's significance, his leadership in the conservative movement, the 9/12 Project and its impact, and Cynthia's perspective on his relatability.

I need to keep it concise but cover all these points without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, maintaining the moral tone the author presented.
