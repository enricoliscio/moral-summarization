SUMMARY:
Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a rousing keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), using his trademark chalkboard to blame "progressivism" for America's *problems*. Beck wrote "Progressivism" on the chalkboard to emphasize his belief that America is *suffering* from this ideology. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding its tent to include progressives, asking, "What is this? A *circus*?" Beck asserted that America is an idea that "sets people free," not a *clown show*. Beck's speech came at a time when his popularity as a Fox News host was rising, coinciding with the emergence of the Tea Party Movement and the *rage* directed at Washington. He also launched the 9/12 Project, which outlined values and principles that Beck believes are foundational to America. For many CPAC attendees, Beck is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. In his speech, Beck also opened up about his troubled past, reminding the audience that "life is not fair, and sometimes the *bad guy* wins."
