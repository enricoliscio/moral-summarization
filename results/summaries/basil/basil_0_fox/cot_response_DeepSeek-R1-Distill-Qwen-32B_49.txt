Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a concise summary using those words where appropriate.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "progressivism," "problems," "critic," "simple," "expand," "circus," "free," "troubled," "fair," "wins," "populist," "rage," "values," "principles," "founded," "inspired," "march," "different reasons," "relatable," "everyday guy." These terms seem to carry the author's moral stance on the issues discussed.

Next, I'll summarize the article. I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll start by mentioning Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC, his criticism of progressivism, and his use of the chalkboard. I'll note his rejection of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, comparing it to a circus. I'll include his personal statement about life not being fair and the bad guy sometimes winning. Then, I'll mention the context of the Tea Party Movement and the 9/12 Project, highlighting the values and principles. Finally, I'll include Cynthia Burgiss's perspective, emphasizing Beck's relatability and the unity he inspires.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining the moral framing. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I think I've covered all the key points and included the necessary moral terms. Time to put it all together.

**SUMMARY:**  
Glenn Beck, a Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at CPAC, criticizing "progressivism" as the root of America's problems. He used his trademark chalkboard to emphasize his point, rejecting the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, calling it "not that simple." Beck mocked the notion, likening it to a "circus," and stressed that America is an idea that sets people "free." He also shared insights from his troubled past, stating, "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." Beck's speech came amid rising popularity coinciding with the Tea Party Movement and populist "rage" against Washington. He launched the 9/12 Project, promoting nine "values" and 12 "principles" he believes define America. Cynthia Burgiss, a supporter, called Beck a "relatable... everyday guy," crediting him for inspiring unity across races, religions, and political affiliations. Beck's message resonated deeply with CPAC attendees, many of whom saw him as a leader in the conservative movement.
