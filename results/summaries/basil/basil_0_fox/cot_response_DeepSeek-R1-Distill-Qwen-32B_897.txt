Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a two-step process: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a summary using as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, Glenn Beck is speaking at CPAC, criticizing progressivism. The key terms here are "progressivism," "problems," "blamed," "America," "suffering," "President Obama," "Republican Party," "expand," "circus," "America," "idea," "sets people free," "troubled past," "life is not fair," "bad guy sometimes wins," "Tea Party Movement," "populist rage," "Washington," "values," "principles," "founded upon," "march," "different reasons," "relatable," "everyday guy."

Now, for the summary, I need to include these terms while keeping it concise. I should start by mentioning Beck's speech, his blame on progressivism, the audience's reaction, his criticism of Obama, and his rejection of expanding the Republican Party. I'll also include his quote about America being an idea that sets people free. Then, touch on his troubled past and the themes of life not being fair. Finally, mention the Tea Party Movement, the 9/12 Project, and the attendee's perspective on Beck.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me piece it together, ensuring all key moral terms are included without making it too wordy.
