SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck gave the keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems and rejecting the idea of including progressives in the Republican Party. Beck, known for his chalkboard prop, wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his point. He also opened up about his past struggles, stating that people need to accept that life is unfair. Beck's speech was a highlight for many CPAC attendees, who see him as a leader in the conservative movement. His popularity as a Fox News host has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist anger towards Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which promotes values and principles he believes the country was founded upon, and inspired a major march in Washington. Attendees praised Beck as a relatable, everyday guy and a leader in the new conservative movement.
