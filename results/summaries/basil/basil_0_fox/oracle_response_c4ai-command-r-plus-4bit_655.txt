SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, using his trademark chalkboard to underscore his belief that "progressivism" is to blame for America's problems. Beck, an outspoken critic of President Obama, rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, stating that America is an idea that sets people free and is not a clown show. He opened up about his troubled past, emphasizing that life is not fair and sometimes the bad guy wins. Beck's speech comes after a year in which his popularity soared, coinciding with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and rage directed at Washington. His 9/12 Project, based on values and principles he believes the country was founded upon, inspired a march in Washington, bringing people of diverse backgrounds together. For many attendees, Beck is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement, and his relatable, everyday guy persona resonates with his followers. END OF SUMMARY.
