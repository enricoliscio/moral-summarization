SUMMARY:

Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his belief that it is the root of America's suffering. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck also opened up about his troubled past, saying "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." The speech was a highlight of the three-day conference, which featured numerous politicians mentioned as contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Many attendees came specifically to see Beck, who is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. His popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington.
