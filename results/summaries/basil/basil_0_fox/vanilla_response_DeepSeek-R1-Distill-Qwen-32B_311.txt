SUMMARY:  
Glenn Beck, in his keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), criticized "progressivism" as the root of America's problems, using his trademark chalkboard to emphasize his point. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, calling it "not that simple" and likening it to a circus. Beck also shared insights from his troubled past, stating, "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." His speech capped three days of discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees viewing him as a leader in the conservative movement. Beck's growing popularity coincides with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist anger toward Washington. He also highlighted the 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles he believes the country was founded upon. Attendees, like Cynthia Burgiss, praised Beck as a "relatable... everyday guy" and credited him with inspiring unity across diverse groups.  
END OF SUMMARY.
