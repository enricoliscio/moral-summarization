SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he fervently opposed the notion of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives. Beck, known for his chalkboard prop, wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his belief that it is the root cause of America's woes. He shared his personal struggles to illustrate his conviction that life is not always fair and that sometimes the bad guy wins. Beck's speech resonated with many attendees, who view him as a leader of the new conservative movement. His popularity has grown alongside the Tea Party Movement and the 9/12 Project, which promotes the values and principles that Beck believes are foundational to America. A 22-year-old student, Cynthia Burgiss, who attended the 9/12 march in Washington, D.C., praised Beck's relatability and credited him for bringing people of different backgrounds together for a common cause. She and other CPAC attendees believe that Beck embodies the idea of setting people free from the constraints of progressivism. END OF SUMMARY.
