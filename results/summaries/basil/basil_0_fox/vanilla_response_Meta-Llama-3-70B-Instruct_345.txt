SUMMARY:

Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his point, bringing the audience to its feet. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck also opened up about his troubled past, saying "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees citing Beck as the reason they came. Beck's growing popularity as a Fox News host has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. His 9/12 Project, which sets forth nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington in September.
