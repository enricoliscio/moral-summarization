SUMMARY:
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. With his trademark chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America is suffering from the ideologies of progressivism, which he believes restricts freedom. He rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party's tent to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck, a leader in the new conservative movement, shared his troubled past, acknowledging that "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped off three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to CPAC specifically to see Beck. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, has inspired a grassroots movement and a major march in Washington. For many, Beck represents a relatable, everyday guy who embodies the right values. END OF SUMMARY.
