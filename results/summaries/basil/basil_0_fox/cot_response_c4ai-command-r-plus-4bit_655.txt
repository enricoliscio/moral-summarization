SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck delivered a rousing keynote speech at CPAC, blaming "progressivism" for America's problems and rejecting the idea of including progressives within the Republican Party. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck underscored his belief that America is suffering from "progressivism", a notion that drew laughter from the audience. Beck opened up about his troubled past, acknowledging that life is not fair and sometimes the bad guy wins. The speech came at the end of CPAC, which featured three days of discussions and speakers, including potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates. Beck's growing popularity as a Fox News host has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and rage directed at Washington. He also launched the 9/12 Project, based on values and principles he believes America was founded upon, inspiring a major march in Washington. For many attendees, Beck is seen as a relatable, everyday guy and a leader in the new conservative movement.
