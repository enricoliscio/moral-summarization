SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck, known for his chalkboard rants, delivered a passionate keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's woes. Rejecting the idea of a "big tent" Republican Party that includes progressives, Beck asserted that America is an idea that sets people free. Through his 9/12 Project, Beck has inspired a new conservative movement, channeling the Tea Party's anger at Washington. Beck's speech, laced with personal anecdotes, emphasized the unfairness of life and struck a chord with attendees like Cynthia Burgiss, who sees Beck as a relatable, everyday guy and credits him for bringing people of diverse backgrounds together at the 9/12 march in Washington. Beck's influence extends beyond his top-rated show, as he is now seen as a leader in the conservative movement.
END OF SUMMARY.
