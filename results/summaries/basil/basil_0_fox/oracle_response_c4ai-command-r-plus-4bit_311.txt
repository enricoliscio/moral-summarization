SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, blaming "progressivism" for America's woes. Rejecting calls for the Republican Party to embrace progressive ideals, Beck asserted that America is an idea that "sets people free." Beck's chalkboard, a familiar prop, emphasized his belief that America is suffering from "Progressivism." Beck's speech, which included a reflection on his own troubled past, highlighted the importance of understanding that life is not always fair and that sometimes the bad guy wins. The speech inspired many, including attendee Cynthia Burgiss, who praised Beck for his relatability and leadership in the conservative movement. She also highlighted the unifying nature of the 9/12 Project, a movement inspired by Beck, which brought people of diverse backgrounds "together" for a march in Washington, D.C. Beck's popularity as a Fox News host has grown alongside the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist anger toward Washington. END OF SUMMARY.
