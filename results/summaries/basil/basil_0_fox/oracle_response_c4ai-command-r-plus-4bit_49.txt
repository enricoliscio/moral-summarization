SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck, known for his chalkboard prop, passionately denounced "progressivism" as the root cause of America's issues in his keynote address at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Beck believes that the Republican Party should not accommodate progressives, equating it to including clowns in a circus. He emphasized that America stands for freedom and fair opportunities for all, regardless of background or beliefs. Beck shared his personal struggles, acknowledging that sometimes the bad guy wins and life is not always fair. The speech, which capped off three days of discussions and speeches by prominent figures, attracted many attendees who view Beck as a leader of the new conservative movement.
