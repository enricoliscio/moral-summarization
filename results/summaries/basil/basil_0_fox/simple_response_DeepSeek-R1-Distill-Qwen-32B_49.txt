Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

Glenn Beck is criticizing progressivism, using his chalkboard prop, which is a key part of his style. He's saying that progressivism is the root of America's problems, not just President Obama. He's rejecting the idea that Republicans should include progressives, comparing it to a circus. That's a strong metaphor, showing he thinks it's a chaotic and wrong direction.

He also talks about his past, mentioning that life isn't fair and sometimes the bad guy wins. That adds a personal touch and emphasizes his message about the state of the country. The event is part of a larger movement, with the Tea Party and his 9/12 Project, which promotes certain values. Cynthia Burgiss's quote shows the impact Beck has, making him relatable and a leader.

I need to make sure the summary captures Beck's main arguments, his use of props and metaphors, his rejection of including progressives, and the context of the conservative movement and Tea Party. Also, including Cynthia's perspective adds the audience's view, reinforcing his leadership role.

I should structure the summary to start with Beck's speech, his critique of progressivism, his rejection of expanding the Republican base, his personal statement, and then the context of the event and his influence. Keeping it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all these elements.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure to include all key points without going over. Also, the summary should end with the required tokens. Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all necessary details while preserving the moral framing.
