Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used: free, fair, wins, together. The summary should be under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Glenn Beck criticized progressivism, used a chalkboard prop, rejected the idea of Republicans expanding to include progressives, talked about life not being fair, and mentioned the 9/12 Project. He's a leader in the conservative movement, and his popularity coincides with the Tea Party rise.

I need to include the moral words. "Free" relates to his statement about America being an idea that sets people free. "Fair" comes from his point that life isn't fair. "Wins" is from "the bad guy sometimes wins." "Together" is about people uniting for different reasons.

I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure each moral word is present. I'll keep it concise, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll start by stating Beck's criticism of progressivism, mention the chalkboard, his rejection of expanding the party, his personal statement on fairness, and the 9/12 Project. Then, I'll note his influence and the attendee's perspective on unity.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me put it all together, ensuring the moral words are included and the summary flows well.
