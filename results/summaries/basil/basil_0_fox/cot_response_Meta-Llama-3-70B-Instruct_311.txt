SUMMARY:
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech that blamed "progressivism" for America's problems. With his trademark chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America is suffering from progressivism, not just President Obama. He rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck, seen as a leader in the new conservative movement, shared his troubled past, saying "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." His speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, solidifying his influence in the conservative movement. Beck's 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington, showcasing people from diverse backgrounds coming together for a common cause. END OF SUMMARY.
