SUMMARY: Fox News host and prominent conservative figure Glenn Beck delivered a passionate keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he vehemently opposed the notion of progressivism and its impact on America. With his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his belief that it is the root cause of America's issues. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party embracing progressive ideals, stating that America is an idea that sets people free. Beck's speech, which drew a strong response from the audience, came at a time when his popularity as a Fox News host was soaring, and the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington were gaining momentum. Beck also shared his personal struggles, emphasizing the reality of life's unfairness. His speech inspired many, including attendee Cynthia Burgiss, who praised Beck for his relatability and credited him for inspiring her attendance at the 9/12 march in Washington, D.C. Beck's influence extends beyond his show, as he is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement, shaping political discourse and activism.
