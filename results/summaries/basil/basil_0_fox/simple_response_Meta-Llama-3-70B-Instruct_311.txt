SUMMARY: 

Glenn Beck, a prominent Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he blamed "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his signature chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America's issues stem from progressivism, rather than simply being a result of President Obama's actions. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, stating that America is an idea that sets people free, not a "clown show." Beck shared his personal struggles, noting that life is not always fair and the "bad guy" sometimes wins. His speech capped off three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to CPAC specifically to hear Beck speak. Beck's growing popularity and influence are evident, with his 9/12 Project inspiring a major march in Washington and earning him a reputation as a leader in the new conservative movement.
