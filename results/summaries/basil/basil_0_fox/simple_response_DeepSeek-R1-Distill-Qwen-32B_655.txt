Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

Glenn Beck is at CPAC, using his chalkboard. He's blaming progressivism for America's issues. He says it's not just about Obama, and criticizes the idea of Republicans including progressives. He emphasizes that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus. He talks about his past, saying life isn't fair. The speech was a highlight after three days of events, and Beck is a key figure in the conservative movement. His popularity has grown with the Tea Party and populist anger. He started the 9/12 Project, which had a big march in Washington. A student attendee praised him for being relatable.

So, the summary needs to capture Beck's main points: criticizing progressivism, rejecting Republican expansion, his view of America as an idea, his personal statement on life, his influence in the conservative movement, and the 9/12 Project. Also, include the attendee's quote about him being relatable.

I should make sure to keep the moral aspects, like his stance against progressivism and his emphasis on American values. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with SUMMARY: and end with END OF SUMMARY.

Let me structure it: mention the event, his main criticism, his rejection of including progressives, his view of America, his personal statement, the event's significance, his projects, and the attendee's comment. Keep it all within the word limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and captures all key points with the moral framing intact.
