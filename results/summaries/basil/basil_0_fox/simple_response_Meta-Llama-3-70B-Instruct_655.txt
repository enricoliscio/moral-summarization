SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Beck used his trademark chalkboard to emphasize his point, bringing the audience to its feet. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is an idea that sets people free." Beck also opened up about his troubled past, saying "life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to CPAC specifically to see Beck, who is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. Beck's popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington. His 9/12 Project, which outlines nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington in September. Beck's message resonated with attendees, who see him as a relatable, everyday guy who is fighting for America's founding ideals.
