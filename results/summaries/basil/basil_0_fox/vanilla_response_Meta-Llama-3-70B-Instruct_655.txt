SUMMARY:

Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his belief in what America is suffering from. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck also opened up about his troubled past, saying "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, including potential 2012 Republican presidential nominees. Many attendees came to see Beck, who is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. His popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington.
