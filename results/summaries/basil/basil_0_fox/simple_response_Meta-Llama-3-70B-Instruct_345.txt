SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, a Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Beck used his trademark chalkboard to emphasize his point, writing "Progressivism" on it to illustrate the root of America's suffering. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck also opened up about his troubled past, stating that "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped off three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees attending specifically to see Beck, who is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. Beck's popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington in September. END OF SUMMARY.
