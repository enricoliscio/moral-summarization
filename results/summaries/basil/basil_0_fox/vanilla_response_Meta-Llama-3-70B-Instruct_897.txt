SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his point, bringing the audience to its feet. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is an idea that sets people free." Beck shared his troubled past, saying "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, including potential 2012 Republican presidential nominees. For many attendees, Beck was the main draw, seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. His growing popularity coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington. Beck's 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington in September.
