SUMMARY: At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Using his trademark chalkboard, Beck wrote "Progressivism" to emphasize his belief in what America is suffering from. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is an idea that sets people free." Beck shared his troubled past, noting that "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." His speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers. Beck's growing popularity coincides with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington, where people of different backgrounds came "together" for a common cause. Attendees saw Beck as a leader in the new conservative movement, a "relatable... everyday guy" who inspires people to come together for a better America. END OF SUMMARY.
