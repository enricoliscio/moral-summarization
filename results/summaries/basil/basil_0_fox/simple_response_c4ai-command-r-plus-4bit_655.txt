SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), using his trademark chalkboard to underscore his belief that "progressivism" is the root cause of America's problems. Rejecting the idea of expanding the Republican Party tent to include progressives, Beck asserted that "America is not a clown show, but an idea that sets people free." Beck's speech, which included a reflection on his own troubled past, captivated the audience and reinforced his role as a leader in the new conservative movement. He argued that life is unfair and that sometimes the bad guy wins. The speech came at a time when Beck's popularity as a Fox News host was at its peak, coinciding with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and the 9/12 Project, which he launched to promote the values and principles he believes the country was founded upon. For many CPAC attendees, Beck's speech was the highlight of the three-day event, with one young attendee praising him as a relatable, everyday guy who has united people of different backgrounds and beliefs.
