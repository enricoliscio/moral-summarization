SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered the keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), using his trademark chalkboard to blame "progressivism" for America's problems. Beck rejected the idea that the Republican Party should include progressives, stating that America is an idea that sets people free. He also opened up about his past, emphasizing that life is not fair. Beck's speech was highly anticipated by CPAC attendees, who see him as a leader in the new conservative movement. His growing popularity as a Fox News host has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and rage directed at Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which inspired a march in Washington, D.C., and his followers praise him for being relatable and an everyday guy.
