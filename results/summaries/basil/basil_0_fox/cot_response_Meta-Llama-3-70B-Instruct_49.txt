SUMMARY:
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. Beck, an outspoken critic of President Obama, rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, emphasizing that "America is an idea that sets people free." He also shared his personal struggles, acknowledging that "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." Beck's speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, solidifying his position as a leader in the new conservative movement. His popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. Beck's 9/12 Project, which outlines nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington and has brought people together from different backgrounds. END OF SUMMARY.
