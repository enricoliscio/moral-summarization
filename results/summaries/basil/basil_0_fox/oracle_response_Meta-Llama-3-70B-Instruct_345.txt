SUMMARY: 

Glenn Beck, Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. With his trademark chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America is suffering from progressivism, not just President Obama. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck shared his troubled past, stating "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to CPAC specifically to see Beck, seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. Beck's popularity coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington, bringing people of every race, political affiliation, and religion together.
