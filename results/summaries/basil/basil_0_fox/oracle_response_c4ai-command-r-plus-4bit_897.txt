SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck, known for his chalkboard prop, delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, blaming "progressivism" for America's woes. Rejecting the idea of a "big tent" Republican Party inclusive of progressives, Beck asserted that America is an idea that "sets people free." Beck's honest account of his own troubled past served as a reminder that life is not always "fair," but that doesn't mean the "bad guy" should "win." The speech, a highlight of the conference, attracted a dedicated following of Beck supporters, who view him as a leader in the new conservative movement. His 9/12 Project, promoting core values and principles, drew a diverse range of Americans "together" in a march on Washington, showcasing an America where "people of every race, political affiliation, [and] religion came together." For many, Beck's appeal lies in his relatability as an "everyday guy." END OF SUMMARY.
