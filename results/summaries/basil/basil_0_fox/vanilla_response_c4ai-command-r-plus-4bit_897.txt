SUMMARY: Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered the keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), using his trademark chalkboard to blame "progressivism" for America's issues. Beck rejected the idea that the Republican Party should include progressives, stating that America is an idea that sets people free. He opened up about his past struggles and emphasized that life is not fair. Beck's speech was a highlight for many CPAC attendees, who view him as a leader in the new conservative movement. His growing popularity as a Fox News host has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and anger directed at Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which led to a major march in Washington, D.C., in September. A 22-year-old student, Cynthia Burgiss, who attended the march, praised Beck as a relatable everyday guy and credited him for making it happen. Beck's speech underscored his belief that America's challenges stem from "progressivism."
