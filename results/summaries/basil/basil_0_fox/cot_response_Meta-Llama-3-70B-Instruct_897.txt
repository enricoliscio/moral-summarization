SUMMARY:
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech that brought the crowd to its feet. Beck blamed "progressivism" for America's problems, emphasizing that the country is suffering from this ideology. He rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party's tent to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." Beck shared his personal struggles, noting that "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped a three-day event featuring high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to Beck as a leader in the new conservative movement. Beck's popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington. His 9/12 Project, which outlines nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington. END OF SUMMARY.
