SUMMARY:
Fox News host Glenn Beck gave a passionate speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he vehemently denounced "progressivism" as the root of America's *problems*. Armed with his signature chalkboard, Beck emphasized his belief that America is ailing from "Progressivism", a notion that rejects expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, asking, "What is this? A *circus*?". Beck opened up about his own troubled past, stating that people need to accept that life is unfair and sometimes the *bad guy* wins. Beck's speech served as the culmination of CPAC, which featured three days of discussions and speeches by prominent figures, including potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates. Beck's growing popularity as a Fox News host has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and the channeling of populist *rage* toward Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which promotes nine *values* and twelve *principles* that he believes are foundational to America. His speech resonated with attendees, who viewed him as a leader of the new conservative movement and an *everyday guy* who is relatable and inspiring.
