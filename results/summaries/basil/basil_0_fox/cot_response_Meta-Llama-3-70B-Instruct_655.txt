SUMMARY:
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered a keynote speech that blamed "progressivism" for America's problems. Beck, a vocal critic of President Obama, rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, saying "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free." He emphasized that life is not always "fair" and that the "bad guy" sometimes wins. Beck's speech capped a three-day event that featured numerous politicians and high-profile speakers. The event was a testament to Beck's growing popularity as a leader in the new conservative movement, which has inspired a sense of "populist rage" against Washington. Many attendees, like 22-year-old Cynthia Burgiss, see Beck as a "relatable" and "everyday guy" who embodies the values of freedom and fairness. END OF SUMMARY.
