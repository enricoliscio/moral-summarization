Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

So, Glenn Beck gave a keynote speech closing CPAC, criticizing progressivism as the root of America's problems. He used his chalkboard prop to emphasize this point. He mentioned that it's not just about President Obama, rejecting the idea that Republicans should include progressives. He compared it to a circus, which made people laugh.

He also talked about his troubled past, saying life isn't fair and sometimes the bad guy wins. The event was part of three days with politicians and speakers, and Beck was a big draw because he's a leader in the conservative movement. His popularity grew alongside the Tea Party Movement and populist anger towards Washington.

Beck started the 9/12 Project, which focuses on nine values and 12 principles he believes the country was founded on. There was a march in Washington inspired by this project. A student attended both the march and CPAC, calling Beck relatable and an everyday guy, crediting him for the movement.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Beck's speech at CPAC, his criticism of progressivism, his use of the chalkboard, his rejection of including progressives in the GOP, the comparison to a circus, his personal statement about life, the event's context with Tea Party and populism, the 9/12 Project, and the impact on attendees.

I'll structure it to flow from his speech, his criticisms, his personal comments, the event's significance, and the project's influence. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going over the word limit.
