Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about Beck blaming progressivism for America's issues, using his chalkboard prop. He criticizes Obama but says it's not just about him. He also rejects the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, calling it a circus. Beck's background is mentioned, and he's seen as a leader in the conservative movement. The Tea Party and his 9/12 Project are also part of the context. The summary needs to be under 200 words and include the moral elements, like his critique of progressivism and the unity aspect of his movement.

I should start by identifying the main points: Beck's speech at CPAC, his critique of progressivism, the rejection of expanding the Republican Party, his personal background, and the impact of his projects. I need to make sure to highlight the moral framing, so phrases like "America is an idea that sets people free" should be included. Also, the unity aspect from the 9/12 march is important to show the positive moral stance. I should keep it concise, ensuring each sentence adds value without going over the word limit. Let me structure it by starting with the event, his main argument, his rejection of inclusivity, personal touch, and the movement's impact. I'll end with a quote from Cynthia Burgiss to emphasize the positive moral message.
