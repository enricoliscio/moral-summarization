Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: free, fair, wins, together. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Glenn Beck gave a speech at CPAC, criticizing progressivism. He used a chalkboard to emphasize his points. He mentioned that life isn't fair and that the bad guy sometimes wins. He also talked about the Republican Party not expanding to include progressives, comparing it to a circus. Beck is seen as a leader in the conservative movement and has started the 9/12 Project, which focuses on core American values. The article also mentions a student who attended his march and sees him as relatable.

Now, I need to include the moral words. "Free" relates to his statement about America being an idea that sets people free. "Fair" comes from his comment that life isn't fair. "Wins" is when he says the bad guy sometimes wins. "Together" can be tied to the 9/12 Project bringing people together.

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Beck's speech, his criticism of progressivism, the use of the chalkboard, his statements on fairness and the bad guy winning. Mention the rejection of expanding the Republican Party, the comparison to a circus. Then talk about his role as a conservative leader, the 9/12 Project, and the attendee's perspective on unity and relatability.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure each moral word is included where appropriate without forcing them in. The summary should flow naturally while highlighting the moral aspects.
