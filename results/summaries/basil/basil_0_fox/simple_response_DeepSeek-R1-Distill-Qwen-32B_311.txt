Okay, so the user has provided a news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. They want a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. I need to make sure I capture the essence of Beck's message and the context.

First, I should identify the key points. Beck is criticizing progressivism as the root of America's issues. He uses a chalkboard to emphasize this, which is a visual prop that grabs attention. He also mentions that it's not just about Obama, which shows he's pointing to a broader issue.

He rejects the idea of Republicans including progressives, which highlights his stance on party unity. The mention of his troubled past adds a personal touch, showing he's relatable. The event is at CPAC, which is a conservative conference, so that's important context.

Also, Beck's 9/12 Project and its influence are key. The student's quote shows the impact of his movement. I need to include that to show the broader implications.

I should structure the summary to flow from his speech, the rejection of progressivism, his personal message, the event's context, and the movement's reach. Keeping it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but comprehensive.

I should ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”progressivism as the problem, the idea of freedom, and the unifying aspect of his project. Also, highlighting his role as a leader in the conservative movement ties it all together.

Alright, time to put it all together in a coherent, concise summary that meets the word limit and captures the moral elements the author intended.

SUMMARY:  
Glenn Beck, in his keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), criticized "progressivism" as the root of America's problems, using his signature chalkboard to emphasize his point. He rejected the idea that the Republican Party should accommodate progressives, calling it "a circus," and stressed that America is "an idea that sets people free." Beck also reflected on his troubled past, telling the audience, "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." His speech came amid his rising popularity and the growth of the Tea Party Movement, which he helped inspire through his 9/12 Project, promoting core American values. Beck's message resonated with attendees, many of whom saw him as a leader in the conservative movement. His influence was evident in events like the 9/12 march in Washington, where people of diverse backgrounds came together, as noted by attendee Cynthia Burgiss. Beck's relatability and focus on freedom and unity underscored his role as a key figure in the conservative resurgence.  
END OF SUMMARY.
