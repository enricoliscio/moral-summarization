Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I need to write a concise summary using those words.

Looking at the article, I see words like "progressivism," "problems," "suffering," "critic," "Republicans," "circus," "America," "free," "troubled past," "unfair," "bad guy," "wins," "values," "principles," "founded," "Tea Party Movement," "populist rage," "Washington," "inspired," "march," "relatable," "everyday guy." These words carry moral connotations as they relate to Glenn Beck's critique and the conservative movement's stance.

Now, I need to summarize the article. I should mention Beck's speech, his criticism of progressivism, the audience's reaction, his rejection of expanding the Republican Party, his personal message, and the context of the conservative movement and Tea Party. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start by stating Beck's main argument, then touch on the audience's reaction, his comments on the Republican Party, his personal statement, and the broader context of the conservative movement and the Tea Party. I'll end with the impact of his speech on attendees.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing. Let me put it all together.

**SUMMARY:**  
Glenn Beck, in his keynote speech at CPAC, criticized "progressivism" as the root of America's problems, using his signature chalkboard to emphasize his point. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, likening it to a "circus." Beck also addressed his troubled past, stating, "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." His speech came amid growing conservative and Tea Party movements, with Beck's 9/12 Project inspiring a Washington march. Attendees, like Cynthia Burgiss, praised Beck as a "relatable... everyday guy," crediting him for inspiring unity across diverse groups. Beck's message resonated as a call for America to return to its founding values and principles.
