SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, a prominent Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. With his trademark chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America is suffering from progressivism, which hinders people from being truly "free". He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, stating that "America is an idea that sets people free", not a "circus". Beck also shared his personal struggles, acknowledging that "life is not fair" and that "the bad guy sometimes wins". The speech capped a three-day conference, where Beck was seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington, bringing people "together" from diverse backgrounds. Attendees, like Cynthia Burgiss, admired Beck as a "relatable" and "everyday guy" who inspires unity. END OF SUMMARY.
