Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: free, fair, wins, and together. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Glenn Beck is speaking at CPAC, criticizing progressivism and rejecting the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives. He uses a chalkboard prop, which is a key part of his style. He mentions that life isn't fair and that sometimes the bad guy wins, which ties into the moral framing. The article also talks about his influence with the Tea Party and the 9/12 Project, emphasizing unity.

I need to make sure the summary includes the words 'free,' 'fair,' 'wins,' and 'together.' I'll structure the summary to highlight Beck's main arguments and his impact. I'll mention his criticism of progressivism, his rejection of expanding the Republican Party, the use of the chalkboard, and his personal message about life not being fair. I'll also touch on the attendees and the movement he's inspiring, using 'together' to show unity.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. I'll start with Beck's keynote speech, his criticism, the audience reaction, his personal message, and conclude with his influence and the movement's unity.

His message of freedom, fairness, and unity struck a chord, with supporters like Cynthia Burgiss calling him a "relatable... everyday guy" who embodies the spirit of a free and united America.
