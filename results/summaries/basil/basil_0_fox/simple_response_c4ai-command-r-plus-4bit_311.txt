SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, a prominent Fox News host and outspoken critic of President Obama, delivered the keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's woes. Rejecting the idea of a big tent Republican Party that includes progressives, Beck asserted that "America is not a clown show" but rather "an idea that sets people free." Beck's chalkboard prop, a trademark of his show, was used to emphasize his point about the dangers of progressivism. The host opened up about his own troubled past to illustrate his belief that life is unfair and sometimes the bad guy wins. Beck's speech was the highlight of the conference for many attendees, who see him as a leader of the new conservative movement. His popularity has risen alongside the Tea Party Movement and populist anger towards Washington. Beck's 9/12 Project, promoting the values and principles America was founded upon, inspired a massive march in Washington. For many, Beck embodies the relatable, everyday American and is a driving force behind a renewed sense of political engagement and activism. END OF SUMMARY.
