SUMMARY: 

Glenn Beck, a prominent Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he attributed America's problems to "progressivism". Using his signature chalkboard, Beck emphasized that America is suffering from progressivism, rather than a single individual, like President Obama. He rejected the idea of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives, stating that "America is an idea that sets people free". Beck shared his personal struggles, acknowledging that "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins". The speech capped off three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees drawn to CPAC specifically to hear Beck, who is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. His 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington, where people from diverse backgrounds came "together" for a common cause. Beck's relatable and down-to-earth persona has resonated with many, including Cynthia Burgiss, who attended the 9/12 march and CPAC, saying "this is how America should be".
