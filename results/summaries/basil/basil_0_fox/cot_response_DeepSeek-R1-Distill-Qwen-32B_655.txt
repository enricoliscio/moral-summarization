Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article. It's about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC, criticizing progressivism and promoting conservatism. He uses a chalkboard, mentions his past, and talks about the Tea Party Movement. 

The user has specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a concise summary using those words. 

For the first step, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "progressivism," "problems," "suffering," "critic," "simple," "expand," "circus," "America," "idea," "free," "troubled past," "life," "fair," "bad guy," "wins," "populist," "rage," "values," "principles," "founded," "march," "inspired," "different reasons," "relatable," "everyday guy." These words are key to the moral arguments presented.

Next, the summary needs to capture the essence while including as many of these words as possible. I'll start by stating Beck's criticism of progressivism, mention his speech at CPAC, his use of the chalkboard, and his rejection of expanding the Republican Party to include progressives. I'll include his personal statement about life not being fair and the context of the Tea Party Movement. Also, I should mention the 9/12 Project and the attendee's perspective on Beck as a relatable figure.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key moral points. Making sure the summary flows well and accurately represents Beck's message without adding any personal opinions.

Glenn Beck criticized "progressivism" as the root of America's problems during his CPAC keynote speech, using his chalkboard to emphasize his point. He rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, calling it a "circus" and asserting that America is an "idea that sets people free." Beck also shared insights from his "troubled past," stating, "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins." His speech came amid the rise of the Tea Party Movement and "populist rage" against Washington. Beck's "9/12 Project," promoting nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington. Attendees like Cynthia Burgiss praised Beck as a "relatable... everyday guy," crediting him for inspiring unity across diverse groups. Beck's message resonated with conservative attendees, solidifying his role as a leader in the new conservative movement. END OF SUMMARY.
