SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, a Fox News host, delivered a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), blaming "progressivism" for America's problems. He used his trademark chalkboard to emphasize his point, writing "Progressivism" on it to underscore his belief that it's the root of America's suffering. Beck rejected the idea of the Republican Party expanding to include progressives, saying America is not a "clown show" but an idea that sets people free. He shared his personal struggles, saying "life is not fair" and "the bad guy sometimes wins." The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, with many attendees coming specifically to see Beck, who is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. His popularity has coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage against Washington. Beck's 9/12 Project, which promotes nine values and 12 principles, inspired a major march in Washington and has brought people together from different backgrounds.
