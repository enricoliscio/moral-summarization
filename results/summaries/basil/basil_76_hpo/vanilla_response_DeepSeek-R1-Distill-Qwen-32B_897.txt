Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the White House's response to allegations against Roy Moore. So, the main points are:

1. Trump's response: He doesn't think an old allegation should ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside.
2. Pence's spokesperson says if true, it disqualifies Moore from office.
3. Moore's campaign denies the allegations, calling them fake news.
4. The Washington Post investigated with over 30 sources.
5. Republican lawmakers are urging Moore to drop out if the allegations are true.
6. Trump's history: He dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against himself and defended his 2005 remarks as locker room talk.
7. Moore won the primary against Strange, whom Trump initially supported but then switched to backing Moore.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's stance, mention Pence's comment, Moore's denial, the investigation, the lawmakers' call, Trump's past behavior, and the primary context. Keep it concise and clear.
