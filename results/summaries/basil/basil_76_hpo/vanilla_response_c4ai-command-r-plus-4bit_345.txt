SUMMARY: The White House responded to allegations that Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence said that if the allegations are true, Moore would be disqualified from serving in office. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." Many Republican lawmakers have called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. Trump himself has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, which he dismissed during his 2016 campaign. Trump initially backed Moore's opponent, Luther Strange, but later deleted those tweets and supported Moore after his primary win.

END OF SUMMARY.
