Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate nominee, and allegations of sexual misconduct from decades ago. The White House, through Sarah Huckabee Sanders, responded by saying Trump believes that mere allegations shouldn't ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Mike Pence's spokesperson also said the allegations are disturbing and would disqualify someone from office. Moore's campaign is denying the claims, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did an investigation with over 30 sources. Many Republican lawmakers are asking Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. 

I remember that Trump himself dismissed similar allegations during his campaign and even talked about a tape where he bragged about sexual assault, calling it locker room talk. Moore won the primary against Strange, whom Trump initially supported but then backed Moore after the win.

So, the moral framing here seems to be about the credibility of the allegations versus the accused's right to be presumed innocent. There's also a contrast between Trump's past behavior and his current stance. Additionally, the article points out the hypocrisy in Trump's support for Moore after initially backing Strange, which might be a moral point about political inconsistency.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without going into too much detail. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Trump's response, the denial from Moore's camp, the investigation, the lawmakers' reactions, and the context of Trump's past behavior. I should also mention the political shift from Strange to Moore.

Let me structure it: Start with the allegations, Trump's response, Pence's reaction, Moore's denial, the investigation, the calls for Moore to drop out, and then mention Trump's past handling of similar issues and his political shift.

I should be careful to present the information factually but also highlight the moral aspects, like the contrast between Trump's support and his past behavior, and the credibility of the allegations versus the accused's rights.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all necessary points.
