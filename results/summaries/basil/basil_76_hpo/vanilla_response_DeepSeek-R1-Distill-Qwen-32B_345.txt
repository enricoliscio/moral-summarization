Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore and the White House's response. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the White House responded to allegations against Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate nominee. President Trump's stance is that mere allegations shouldn't destroy someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, conveyed this message while traveling with Trump in Asia.

Then, Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson said that if the allegations are true, Moore would be disqualified from office. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "fake news," and the Washington Post did a thorough investigation with over 30 sources.

Numerous Republican lawmakers are urging Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. The article also connects this to Trump's past behavior during his 2016 campaign, where he dismissed similar allegations against himself and defended a tape where he bragged about sexual assault, calling it "locker room talk."

Additionally, it's noted that Moore won the primary against the establishment candidate, Sen. Strange, whom Trump initially supported but then withdrew his endorsement after Moore's victory.

So, the main points are:
- Trump's response to the allegations against Moore.
- Pence's reaction.
- Moore's campaign denying the allegations.
- The investigation by the Washington Post.
- Republican lawmakers' calls for Moore to drop out.
- Trump's past behavior regarding similar allegations.
- The primary race dynamics between Moore and Strange.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should make sure to include Trump's stance, Pence's comment, Moore's denial, the investigation, the lawmakers' calls, Trump's past, and the primary race context. I'll need to be concise and ensure each point is clearly addressed without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Introduce the White House's response to Moore's allegations.
2. Mention Trump's belief about not letting allegations destroy a life, but Moore should step aside if true.
3. Include Pence's spokesperson's statement.
4. Note Moore's campaign denial and the Washington Post's investigation.
5. Highlight Republican lawmakers urging Moore to drop out if true.
6. Connect to Trump's past dismissal of similar allegations.
7. Mention the primary race context, including Trump's initial support for Strange and then backing Moore.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all key points succinctly.
