SUMMARY: The White House responded to disturbing allegations against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders relayed President Trump's belief that allegations, especially from many years ago, should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." A spokesperson for Vice President Pence echoed this sentiment, stating that if true, such allegations would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign denied the accusations, calling them "fake news." During his own campaign, Trump dismissed similar allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and threatened to sue his accusers, characterizing a tape of him bragging about sexual assault as "locker room talk." Trump initially backed Moore's opponent in the Alabama primary but later deleted those tweets and supported Moore. This response highlights the moral dilemma of addressing historical sexual misconduct allegations while preserving the presumption of innocence.
END OF SUMMARY.
