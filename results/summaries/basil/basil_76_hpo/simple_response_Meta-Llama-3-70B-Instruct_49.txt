SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with President Trump's press secretary saying that Trump believes allegations should not be allowed to destroy a person's life without proof, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence has also spoken out, calling the allegations "disturbing" and saying that if true, they would disqualify Moore from serving in office. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual molestation of a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." Many Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. The situation is notable given Trump's own history of dismissing allegations of sexual misconduct against himself.

The moral framing of this article is clear: the allegations against Moore are serious and disturbing, and if true, would be disqualifying for public office. The article also highlights the hypocrisy of Trump's response, given his own history of similar allegations. The implication is that those in power should be held to a higher standard of accountability, and that allegations of sexual misconduct should be taken seriously.
