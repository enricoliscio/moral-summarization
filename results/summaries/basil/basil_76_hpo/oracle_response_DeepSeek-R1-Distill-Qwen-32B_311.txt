Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Roy Moore and the allegations against him. The user provided specific morally charged words that should be included: molested, true, fake, misconduct, threatened, assault, talk.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about Trump's response to the allegations that Moore molested a 14-year-old in 1979. Trump said he doesn't believe mere allegations should destroy someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's spokesperson found the allegations disturbing and believes it disqualifies Moore. Moore's campaign called the accusations fake news, and The Washington Post did a thorough investigation with over 30 sources. Many Republicans called for Moore to drop out if true. Trump previously dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against himself, threatened to sue accusers, and claimed the 2005 tape was locker room talk. Moore won the primary against Strange, who Trump initially supported but then backed Moore.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include all the morally framed words. I'll structure it by mentioning Trump's response, the allegations, the fake news claim, the Republican calls for Moore to step aside, Trump's past behavior, and the primary context.

I should make sure each key point is covered without going over the word limit. Also, maintain the moral tone by using the specified words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is concise and includes the necessary terms.

SUMMARY:  
President Donald Trump responded to allegations that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, stating that "mere allegations" should not destroy a person's life but, if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson called the allegations "disturbing" and said they would disqualify anyone from office. Moore's campaign dismissed the claims as "fake news," while The Washington Post reported they interviewed over 30 sources. Many Republicans urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump has previously dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against himself, threatened to sue accusers, and claimed a 2005 tape of him bragging about assault was "locker room talk." Moore won the Alabama primary after Trump initially backed his rival, Sen. Luther Strange, but later supported Moore.  
END OF SUMMARY.
