SUMMARY: President Trump responded to allegations that GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, saying that while he believes a person's life shouldn't be ruined by a mere allegation, Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders relayed Trump's response, while Vice President Pence's spokesperson said the allegations, if true, would disqualify Moore from serving in office. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." The accusations came from four women and were reported by The Washington Post after their reporters spoke to over 30 sources. Several Republican lawmakers have called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are substantiated. Trump previously dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and supported Moore after he won the primary, despite initially backing Moore's opponent.
