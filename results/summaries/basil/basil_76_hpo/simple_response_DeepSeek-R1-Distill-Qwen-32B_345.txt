Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. The article is about the White House's response to allegations against Roy Moore. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the key points.

First, the article mentions that President Trump's response was relayed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Trump says he doesn't think mere allegations should ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Then, Mike Pence's spokesperson says the allegations are disturbing and would disqualify someone from office. Moore's campaign denies the allegations, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did an investigation with over 30 sources. Many Republican lawmakers are calling for Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump's past behavior is also mentioned, like dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against himself and defending his 2005 tape as locker room talk. Moore won the primary against Strange, who Trump initially supported but then switched to backing Moore after the primary.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing. The article seems to highlight the contrast between Trump's support for Moore despite the allegations and the potential hypocrisy given Trump's own history with similar issues. Also, the denial of the allegations as fake news and the investigation by the Post are important points.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's stance, Pence's reaction, the denial, the investigation, the lawmakers' calls, and the context of Trump's past behavior. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but cover all these aspects.

I'll start by stating Trump's belief that allegations shouldn't ruin lives but if true, Moore should step aside. Then mention Pence's view. Next, note the denial and the Post's investigation. Then, the lawmakers' calls for Moore to drop out. Finally, include Trump's past behavior regarding similar allegations and his eventual support for Moore despite initial backing of Strange.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral framing by showing the contrast between Trump's support and the ethical implications of the allegations.
