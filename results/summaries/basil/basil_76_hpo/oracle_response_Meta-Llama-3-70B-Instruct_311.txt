SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Donald Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence finds the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. Moore's campaign denies the allegations, calling them "fake news." However, numerous Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This is not the first time Trump has faced similar allegations, having dismissed misconduct claims from over a dozen women during his 2016 campaign and downplaying a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault as "locker room talk."

END OF SUMMARY.
