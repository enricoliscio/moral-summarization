SUMMARY: The White House responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, with President Trump stating that he believes allegations cannot destroy a person's life but that Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. Vice President Mike Pence also found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify Moore from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." The allegations have caused a stir among Republican lawmakers, with many calling for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This incident also brings to light Trump's own history of dismissing allegations of sexual misconduct during his 2016 campaign and his support for Moore after the primary. Trump initially backed Moore's opponent, Sen. Luther Strange, but later deleted his tweets in support of Strange and endorsed Moore.
END OF SUMMARY.
