SUMMARY:
The White House responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, saying that President Trump believes a person's life should not be destroyed by a mere allegation, but if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "the very definition of fake news." Despite this, numerous Republican lawmakers called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. Notably, Trump had previously dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and had supported Moore, calling him "a really great guy." The controversy has sparked debate and raised questions about the moral character of those in public office. END OF SUMMARY.
