SUMMARY:
The White House responded to allegations that Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that while President Trump believes that "a mere allegation" should not "destroy a person's life," if the allegations are true, "Judge Moore will do the *wrong* thing and step aside." A spokesperson for Vice President Pence also commented, saying that he found the allegations *disturbing* and that if true, they would *disqualify* Moore from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the accusations, calling them "fake news." The Washington Post's investigation included interviews with over 30 sources. Many Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are substantiated. Trump himself has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, which he dismissed during his 2016 campaign. He also received support from Moore's supporters, including Steve Bannon, after disavowing his endorsement of Moore's primary opponent. Trump later deleted tweets supporting his opponent and praised Moore as "a really great guy."
