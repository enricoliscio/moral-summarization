SUMMARY:
The White House has responded to bombshell allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Donald Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if the allegations are true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside. Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations disturbing and believes that if true, they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "the very definition of fake news." However, numerous Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This controversy raises questions about Trump's own history of dismissing allegations of sexual misconduct against himself. END OF SUMMARY.
