Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article is about the White House's response to allegations against Roy Moore. Trump says he doesn't believe mere allegations should ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's spokesperson also finds the allegations disturbing and believes they disqualify Moore. Moore's campaign denies the claims, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did a thorough investigation with over 30 sources. Many Republicans are urging Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. 

I should also note Trump's past behavior regarding similar allegations against himself and his switch from supporting Strange to Moore. The moral framing here is about accountability and the consequences of such allegations in public office. I need to make sure the summary reflects that tension between not believing accusations without evidence and the seriousness of the allegations if true.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's and Pence's responses, the denial from Moore's campaign, the investigation details, and the calls for Moore to step down. I'll also mention Trump's past behavior to highlight the moral contrast. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Trump stated that he believes "a mere allegation" should not ruin a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Pence's spokesperson called the allegations "disturbing" and said they would disqualify anyone from office. Moore's campaign denied the claims, labeling them "fake news," while the Washington Post, which conducted an extensive investigation involving over 30 sources, stood by its reporting. Republican lawmakers have urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump's response contrasts with his past behavior, including dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against himself and downplaying a 2005 tape where he bragged about sexual assault. Moore won the Alabama primary after Trump initially backed his rival, Sen. Luther Strange, but later endorsed Moore. END OF SUMMARY.
