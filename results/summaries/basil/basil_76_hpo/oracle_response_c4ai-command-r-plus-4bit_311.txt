SUMMARY: President Trump responded to allegations that Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a personâ€™s life, but if the allegations are true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." A spokesperson for Vice President Pence also stated that if the allegations are true, they would disqualify Moore from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the accusations, calling them "fake news." During his own campaign, Trump dismissed similar allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and threatened to sue his accusers. He also dismissed a tape of him bragging about sexual assault as "locker room talk." Trump initially backed Moore's opponent in the primary, but after Moore's win, he deleted his tweets supporting the opponent and tweeted in support of Moore. 

END OF SUMMARY.
