Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Roy Moore and the White House's response. My task is to summarize it while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used specific words like "molested," "true," "fake," "misconduct," "threatened," "assault," and "talk." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about President Trump's response to allegations against Roy Moore, who is a Senate nominee. Trump says he doesn't believe mere allegations should ruin someone's life but if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's spokesperson also finds the allegations disturbing and believes they disqualify Moore. Moore's campaign denies the claims, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did an extensive investigation with over 30 sources. Republican lawmakers are calling for Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump has a history of dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against himself and downplayed the 2005 tape. Moore won the primary despite Trump initially supporting another candidate.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the morally charged words. I should start by mentioning Trump's response, the allegations, and the moral implications. Then, include Pence's stance, Moore's denial as fake news, the investigation details, the lawmakers' calls, Trump's past behavior, and Moore's victory despite initial backing.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's response, then the reactions from Pence and Moore, followed by the investigation and political implications. I'll make sure to include all the key moral words without making the summary too lengthy. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200.

I think I have all the elements covered. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and flows naturally. I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump responded to allegations that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, stating that mere allegations should not destroy a person’s life but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence’s spokesperson called the allegations disturbing and disqualifying. Moore’s campaign denied the claims, labeling them “fake news,” while The Washington Post’s investigation involved over 30 sources. Republican lawmakers urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump has a history of dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against himself, including threatening lawsuits and downplaying a 2005 tape where he bragged about sexual assault, calling it “locker room talk.” Despite Trump initially backing Moore’s rival, Sen. Luther Strange, he later endorsed Moore after his primary victory. END OF SUMMARY.
