SUMMARY: The White House responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, with President Trump stating that he believes allegations cannot destroy a person's life but that Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. Vice President Mike Pence also found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify Moore from serving in office. Moore's campaign denied the accusations, calling them "fake news." The allegations have caused a rift in the Republican Party, with many lawmakers calling for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This incident also brings to light Trump's own history of sexual misconduct allegations and his dismissal of them during his 2016 campaign. The Alabama special election has been a point of contention within the GOP, with Trump initially backing the establishment candidate, Luther Strange, who lost to Moore, and later disavowing his endorsement. 

END OF SUMMARY.
