SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with President Trump's press secretary saying that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence also found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. However, Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." This response is hypocritical, considering Trump's own history of dismissing allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and threatening to sue his accusers. The allegations against Moore are particularly disturbing, as they involve a 14-year-old girl. Many Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. The president's own moral character is called into question by his support for Moore, despite having previously backed Moore's opponent in the primary.

END OF SUMMARY.
