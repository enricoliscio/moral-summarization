SUMMARY:
In the wake of disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, the White House has responded. President Donald Trump, through his press secretary, stated that while he believes a mere allegation from many years ago should not destroy a person's life, if the allegations are true, Judge Moore should do the right thing and step aside. This sentiment was echoed by Vice President Mike Pence, who found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the accusations, calling them "fake news." The Washington Post's investigation included interviews with over 30 sources, and several Republican lawmakers have called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are proven true. Trump's response to similar allegations during his 2016 campaign and his support for Moore following the primary victory have also been noted. 
END OF SUMMARY.
