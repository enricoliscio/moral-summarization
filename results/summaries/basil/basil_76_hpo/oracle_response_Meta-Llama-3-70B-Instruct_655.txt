SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." However, numerous Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. Notably, Trump has a history of dismissing allegations of sexual misconduct against himself, and even threatened to sue some of his accusers. The controversy has raised questions about Trump's own behavior, including a 2005 tape where he bragged about sexual assault, which he dismissed as "locker room talk."
