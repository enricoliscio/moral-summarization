SUMMARY:
The White House responded to bombshell allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Donald Trump believes that a mere allegation from many years ago should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside. Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "the very definition of fake news." However, numerous Republican lawmakers called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. Trump has a history of dismissing allegations of sexual misconduct against himself, and his support for Moore has been inconsistent. The controversy surrounding Moore's nomination has sparked a heated debate about what constitutes appropriate behavior for public officials. END OF SUMMARY.
