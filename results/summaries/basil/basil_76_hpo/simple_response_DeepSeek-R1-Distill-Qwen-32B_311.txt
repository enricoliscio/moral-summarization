Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the ethical implications and the stance taken by the parties involved.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main issue is the allegations against Roy Moore, and the reactions from Trump, Pence, and others. The moral framing here is about the consequences of allegations versus actual truth, and the political implications.

I should start by stating the allegations and the responses. Trump's statement about not letting mere allegations destroy someone's life, but also implying that if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's reaction is more critical, saying it would disqualify someone from office. Moore's campaign is denying the claims, calling them fake news.

Then, I need to include the context about Trump's past behavior regarding similar allegations against himself. This adds a moral contrast, showing that Trump's stance now is different from his past actions.

I should also mention the political dynamics, like Moore's primary win against Strange, and Trump's initial support for Strange but then backing Moore after his victory. This shows the shifting political support and the potential hypocrisy in Trump's stance.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential points without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to highlight the moral dilemmas presented by the situation, such as the balance between presumption of innocence and accountability when serious allegations arise.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the allegations, followed by the reactions, the context of Trump's past, and the political implications. This should capture the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that President Trump believes "mere allegations" should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson called the allegations "disturbing" and said they would disqualify anyone from office. Moore's campaign denied the claims, labeling them "fake news." The Washington Post's investigation involved over 30 sources. Republican lawmakers urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump's response contrasts with his past behavior, as he dismissed similar sexual misconduct allegations against himself during his 2016 campaign and defended a 2005 tape where he bragged about sexual assault, calling it "locker room talk." Moore, a controversial judge, won the primary against GOP establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange, whom Trump initially supported but later endorsed Moore after Strange's defeat. END OF SUMMARY.
