SUMMARY:
The White House has responded to the bombshell allegations of sexual molestation against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with President Trump saying that a "mere allegation" from many years ago should not "destroy a person's life". However, if the allegations are "true", Trump believes Moore will "do the right thing and step aside". Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations "disturbing" and believes they would "disqualify" anyone from serving in office if true. The allegations, which Moore's campaign has denied as "fake news", have led to numerous Republican lawmakers calling on Moore to drop out of the race if they are true. This comes after Trump himself was accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women during his 2016 campaign, which he dismissed as "locker room talk". END OF SUMMARY.
