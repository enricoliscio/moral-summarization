SUMMARY: The White House issued a response to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, stating that President Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life but that if the allegations are true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." This response reflects a moral stance that prioritizes the presumption of innocence and the potential for redemption, while also acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations and the potential consequences if they are true. It is worth noting that during his own campaign, Trump dismissed similar allegations against himself and threatened to sue his accusers. Despite initially backing Moore's opponent, Trump eventually supported Moore after his primary win, calling him "a really great guy." This latest development raises questions about political morality and the weight of personal conduct in the evaluation of public figures.

END OF SUMMARY.
