SUMMARY: The White House has responded to disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, with President Trump stating that he believes we cannot allow mere allegations to destroy a person's life, but if the allegations are true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." This moral dilemma has sparked a debate among Republicans, with many calling for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. During his own campaign, Trump dismissed similar allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and threatened to sue his accusers, deeming a tape of him bragging about sexual assault as "locker room talk." This new controversy surrounding Moore has put the GOP in a difficult position, as Moore was backed by Trump and many members of his base despite initially being disavowed by the president. The allegations, denied by Moore and his campaign as "fake news," were investigated by The Washington Post reporters who spoke to over 30 sources. This moral dilemma has the potential to impact the upcoming special election in Alabama and has raised questions about the ethical standards expected of those seeking public office.
END OF SUMMARY.
