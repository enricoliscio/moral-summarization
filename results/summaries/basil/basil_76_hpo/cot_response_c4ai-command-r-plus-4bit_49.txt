SUMMARY:
The White House responded to allegations that Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for the Alabama Senate seat, sexually *molested* a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that while President Trump believes that we cannot *disallow* a person's life to be *destroyed* by a mere allegation, if the *allegations* against Moore are true, "he will do the right thing and step aside." A spokesperson for Vice President Pence said he found the *accusations* *disturbing* and believes they would be *disqualifying* for office, if true. Moore's campaign denied the charges, calling them "fake news." During his own campaign, Trump dismissed similar *allegations* of sexual *misconduct* and *bragging* about sexual *assault*. Trump eventually backed Moore after initially supporting his opponent, Sen. Luther Strange.
