SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that President Trump believes that allegations alone should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson also found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." Several Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This is not the first time Trump has been involved in a sexual misconduct controversy, as he faced similar allegations during his 2016 campaign. Despite initially backing Moore's opponent, Trump later supported Moore after his primary win.
