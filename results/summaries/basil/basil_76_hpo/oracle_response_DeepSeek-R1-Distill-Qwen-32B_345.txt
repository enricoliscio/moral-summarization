Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: molested, true, fake, misconduct, threatened, assault, talk. I should make sure to include these words where appropriate in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the White House's response to allegations against Roy Moore. Trump said that mere allegations shouldn't ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's spokesperson also found the allegations disturbing. Moore's campaign called the accusations fake news, and the Post did a thorough investigation. Many Republicans are asking Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump has a history of dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against himself and trivializing the 2005 tape as locker room talk. Moore won the primary, and Trump initially supported Strange but then switched to support Moore after the primary.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's response, mention the allegations, his stance, Pence's reaction, Moore's denial as fake news, the investigation, Republican calls for Moore to step aside, Trump's past behavior, and the political shift in support.

I should use the morally framed words where they fit naturally. For example, "molested" in the allegations, "true" when referring to the truth of the allegations, "fake" in the campaign's denial, "misconduct" in Trump's history, "threatened" when he threatened to sue accusers, "assault" from the tape, and "talk" as in locker room talk.

Let me structure this step by step, making sure each point is covered concisely and the moral words are included appropriately without forcing them in. I'll also ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the allegations, the responses, Moore's denial, the investigation, political reactions, and Trump's past behavior.

I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's clear and preserves the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The White House responded to allegations that Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, with Trump stating that mere allegations shouldn't ruin a person's life but if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's spokesperson called the allegations disturbing and disqualifying. Moore's campaign labeled the claims as "fake news," while the Washington Post's investigation involved over 30 sources. Many Republicans urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump has a history of dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against himself, threatening accusers, and trivializing a 2005 tape of him discussing assault as "locker room talk." Despite Trump initially backing Strange, he later supported Moore after the primary. END OF SUMMARY.
