SUMMARY:
The White House has responded to disturbing allegations against Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate nominee, who is accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl in 1979. While the White House acknowledges that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, they also state that if the allegations are true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." This stance is echoed by Vice President Mike Pence, who finds the allegations disturbing and believes that if true, they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the accusations, calling them "fake news." This incident has sparked a moral debate among Republican lawmakers, with many calling for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are substantiated. President Trump's own history with allegations of sexual misconduct and assault during his 2016 campaign adds complexity to the issue. Despite initially backing Moore's opponent, Trump eventually supported Moore after his primary win. Now, Trump and the GOP establishment are faced with the difficult decision of how to respond to these serious allegations.
