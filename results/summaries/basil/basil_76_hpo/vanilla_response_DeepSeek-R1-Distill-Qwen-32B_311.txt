Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Roy Moore allegations and the reactions from Trump and others. I need to make sure I capture all the key points without going over 200 words. Let me read through the article again to pick out the main details.

First, the article is about President Trump's response to the allegations against Roy Moore. Trump says he doesn't think mere allegations should ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Then, Mike Pence's spokesperson says the allegations are disturbing and would disqualify Moore. Moore's campaign is denying the claims, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did a thorough investigation, talking to over 30 sources. Many Republicans are calling for Moore to drop out if the allegations are true.

I should also mention Trump's past behavior regarding similar allegations against himself, like dismissing them and threatening lawsuits. Plus, the context of Moore's primary win against Strange, who Trump initially supported but then switched to backing Moore after the primary.

I need to structure this clearly, starting with Trump's response, then Pence's stance, Moore's denial, the investigation details, Republican reactions, Trump's history, and the primary context. I should keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. Let me make sure I don't miss any important details and that the summary flows logically.

Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson called the allegations "disturbing" and said they would disqualify Moore from office. Moore's campaign denied the claims, labeling them "fake news," while The Washington Post, which reported the story, interviewed over 30 sources. Multiple Republican lawmakers urged Moore to withdraw if the allegations are true.

Moore won the Alabama primary against GOP establishment candidate Luther Strange, despite Trump initially backing Strange before endorsing Moore after the primary. END OF SUMMARY.
