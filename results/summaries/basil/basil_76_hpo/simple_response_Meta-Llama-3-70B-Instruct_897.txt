SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that President Trump believes allegations alone should not destroy a person's life. However, if the allegations are true, Trump expects Moore to step aside. Vice President Mike Pence has also spoken out, calling the allegations "disturbing" and saying they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, include claims of sexual molestation of a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." Meanwhile, numerous Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. The irony is not lost, as Trump himself has faced similar allegations in the past and dismissed them as "locker room talk."
