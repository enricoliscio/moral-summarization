SUMMARY: The White House has responded to disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, with President Trump stating that while he believes a single allegation from many years ago should not destroy a person's life, if the allegations are true, Moore should "do the right thing and step aside." This stance is in contrast to Trump's own dismissal of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct during his 2016 campaign, where he threatened accusers and dismissed incriminating statements as "locker room talk." Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." The Washington Post's investigation included interviews with over 30 sources, and the revelation has prompted many Republican lawmakers to call for Moore's withdrawal from the race, should the allegations be true. This development adds to the political drama surrounding Moore's victory in the primary, where Trump initially backed the opposing candidate, only to later support Moore after his win. 

END OF SUMMARY.
