Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore and the White House's response. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about President Trump's response to allegations against Roy Moore. Moore is the Alabama GOP Senate nominee. The allegations are from 1979, when he was accused of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl. The White House, through Sarah Huckabee Sanders, says Trump believes that mere allegations shouldn't ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Mike Pence's spokesperson also said the allegations are disturbing and would disqualify him if true.

Moore's campaign denies the claims, calling them fake news. The Washington Post reported it after talking to over 30 sources. Republican lawmakers are calling for Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump's past behavior is mentioned tooâ€”during his campaign, he dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against himself and claimed the 2005 tape was locker room talk.

Moore won the primary against Strange, who was Trump's initial choice. After Moore won, Trump changed his support, backing Moore instead.

So, the key points are: Trump's stance on the allegations, Pence's reaction, Moore's denial, the investigation by the Post, Republican calls for Moore to step down, Trump's past behavior, and the political background of the primary.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's response, then Pence's, Moore's denial, the investigation, the lawmakers' calls, Trump's past, and the political context.

Make sure to include all important details without going over the word limit. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point.
