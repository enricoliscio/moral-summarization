SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that President Trump believes allegations should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson called the allegations "disturbing" and said they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." The Washington Post reported the allegations after speaking with over 30 sources. Many Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. Notably, Trump had previously dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself and had backed Moore's opponent in the primary.
