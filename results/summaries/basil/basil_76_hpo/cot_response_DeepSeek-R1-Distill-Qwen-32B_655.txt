Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about President Trump's response to allegations against Roy Moore. There are words like "bombshell allegations," "sexual molestation," "destroy a person's life," "fake news," "disturbing," "disqualify," "controversial," and "locker room talk." These words carry moral weight because they're about serious accusations, credibility, and judgment.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible. I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the key points: Trump's stance, Pence's reaction, the denial by Moore's campaign, the investigation by the Post, the calls for Moore to drop out, Trump's past behavior, and the political dynamics between Trump, Strange, and Moore.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's response, then Pence's, followed by the denial and investigation, the political implications, and end with Trump's support for Moore despite initial backing for Strange. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me check the word count to make sure it's under 200. Also, I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved by using those key words identified earlier. I'll make sure each sentence flows into the next, covering all necessary points without being too verbose.

Alright, I think that covers everything. Time to put it all together concisely.

**STEP 1:**  
* Bombshell  
* Allegations  
* Molested  
* Destroy  
* Life  
* Fake news  
* Disturbing  
* Disqualify  
* Controversial  
* Locker room talk  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump responded to bombshell allegations that Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979, stating that mere allegations should not destroy a person's life but that Moore should step aside if the claims are true. Vice President Pence called the allegations disturbing and said they would disqualify anyone from office. Mooreâ€™s campaign denied the claims, labeling them "fake news," while The Washington Post reported their investigation involved over 30 sources. Republican lawmakers urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump previously dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against himself and downplayed a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault as "locker room talk." Moore won the Alabama primary despite Trump initially backing his opponent, Sen. Luther Strange, before reversing course and supporting Moore.  
END OF SUMMARY.
