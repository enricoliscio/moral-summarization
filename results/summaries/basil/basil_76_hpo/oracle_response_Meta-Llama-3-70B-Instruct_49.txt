SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Donald Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." However, numerous Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This is not the first time Trump has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, having dismissed allegations from over a dozen women during his 2016 campaign and downplaying a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault as "locker room talk."
