SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stating that President Trump believes a person's life should not be destroyed by mere allegations. However, if the allegations are true, Trump believes Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence also found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. The allegations, reported by The Washington Post, involve four women, including one who claims Moore sexually molested her when she was 14 years old. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." Many Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. The irony is not lost, as Trump himself has faced similar allegations from over a dozen women and has downplayed the severity of sexual assault.
