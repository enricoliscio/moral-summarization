SUMMARY:
The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with President Trump stating that he believes "a mere allegation" should not "destroy a person's life." However, if the allegations are true, Trump expects Moore "to do the *right* thing and step aside." This response comes amid growing pressure from Republican lawmakers, who have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are substantiated. The allegations, first reported by The Washington Post, involve claims from four women that Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Moore's campaign has vehemently denied these accusations, calling them "*fake* news." During his own campaign, Trump faced similar allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women, which he dismissed as "*slanderous*" and threatened to sue his accusers. Despite initially backing Moore's opponent, Trump eventually supported Moore, calling him "a really *great* guy." This latest scandal raises questions about the moral standards expected of those seeking public office and the potential consequences of such allegations.
