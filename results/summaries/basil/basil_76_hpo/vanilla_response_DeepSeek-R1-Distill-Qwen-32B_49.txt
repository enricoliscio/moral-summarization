Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the White House's response to allegations against Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate nominee. 

First, the key points: President Trump believes that mere allegations shouldn't ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Pence's spokesperson says the allegations are disturbing and would disqualify Moore. Moore's campaign denies the claims, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did an extensive investigation with over 30 sources. Many Republican lawmakers are calling for Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. 

Also, there's context about Trump dismissing similar allegations against himself during his campaign and his initial support for Strange over Moore, which he later changed. 

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's response, then Pence's stance, Moore's denial, the investigation, and the lawmakers' calls. I'll also include the background on Trump's past behavior and his shifting support. 

Let me make sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I should keep it clear and straightforward, focusing on the main reactions and the context. 

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.
