SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that President Trump believes a person's life should not be destroyed by a mere allegation. However, if the allegations are true, Trump thinks Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence has also spoken out, calling the allegations "disturbing" and saying they would disqualify anyone from serving in office if true. The allegations, which include claims of sexual molestation of a 14-year-old girl in 1979, have been denied by Moore's campaign as "fake news." The Washington Post, which broke the story, spoke to over 30 sources during their investigation. Many Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. The irony is not lost that Trump, who has faced similar allegations himself, is now weighing in on the matter.
