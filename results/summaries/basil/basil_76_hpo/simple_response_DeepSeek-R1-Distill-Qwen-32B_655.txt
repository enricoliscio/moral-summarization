Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the White House's response to allegations against Roy Moore. President Trump says that mere allegations shouldn't ruin someone's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Mike Pence's spokesperson says the allegations are disturbing and would disqualify Moore from office. Moore's campaign denies the allegations, calling them fake news. The Washington Post did an extensive investigation with over 30 sources. Many Republican lawmakers are asking Moore to drop out if the allegations are true.

I should note the moral implications here. Trump's stance seems to be against rushing to judgment without evidence, which is a moral point about fairness. On the other hand, Pence's statement emphasizes accountability, suggesting that such behavior is unfit for office. The article also contrasts Trump's support for Moore after the primary, despite initially backing Strange, which shows political strategy over moral judgment.

I need to make sure the summary captures these moral aspects without being too long. I'll structure it to include Trump's and Pence's responses, Moore's denial, the investigation, the lawmakers' calls for Moore to step aside, and the context of Trump's past behavior regarding similar allegations.

Let me make sure to keep it under 200 words and include all key points concisely. I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, highlighting the moral framing as per the original article.

SUMMARY: The White House has responded to allegations that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Trump stated that while he believes allegations should not ruin a person’s life, if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Pence’s spokesperson called the allegations disturbing and said they would disqualify Moore from office. Moore’s campaign denied the claims, labeling them “fake news,” while The Washington Post reported its investigation involved over 30 sources. Multiple Republican lawmakers have urged Moore to drop out if the allegations are true. Trump previously dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against himself and downplayed a 2005 tape where he bragged about sexual assault, calling it “locker room talk.” Despite initially supporting Moore’s opponent, Sen. Luther Strange, Trump later endorsed Moore after his primary win. END OF SUMMARY.
