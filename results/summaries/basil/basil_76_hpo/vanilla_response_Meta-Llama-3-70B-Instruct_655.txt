SUMMARY:

The White House has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that President Trump believes that allegations from many years ago should not destroy a person's life, but if true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news." Multiple Republican lawmakers have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This is not the first time Trump has faced similar allegations, having dismissed claims of sexual misconduct against himself during his 2016 campaign. Trump had initially backed Moore's opponent in the primary, but later supported Moore after his win.
