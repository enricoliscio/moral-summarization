SUMMARY:
The White House responded to bombshell allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979. President Donald Trump believes that a mere allegation should not destroy a person's life, but if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations disturbing and believes they would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Moore's campaign denied the allegations, calling them "the very definition of fake news." However, numerous Republican lawmakers called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. This is not the first time Trump has been involved in a controversy surrounding sexual misconduct, having dismissed allegations against himself from over a dozen women and threatened to sue some of his accusers. Despite initially backing another candidate, Trump eventually tweeted in support of Moore, calling him "a really great guy."
END OF SUMMARY.
