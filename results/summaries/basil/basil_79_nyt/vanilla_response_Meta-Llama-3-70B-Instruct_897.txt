SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump said he feels "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February, and claimed that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result of the investigation. Trump also compared Flynn's situation to that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of lying "many times" to the FBI without facing consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies to be. This comes as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, is focusing on Trump's inner circle.
