SUMMARY:
President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president contrasted Flynn's situation with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed "lied many times" to the F.B.I. without consequences. Trump implied that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result of the investigation, while Clinton faced no repercussions. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's remarks are unusual, as presidents typically avoid influencing the outcome of federal investigations. END OF SUMMARY.
