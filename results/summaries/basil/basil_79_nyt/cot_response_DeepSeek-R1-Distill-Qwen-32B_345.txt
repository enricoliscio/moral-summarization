Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with a moral framing. They provided a specific article about Trump's comments on Flynn and Clinton. First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article mentions "lied" multiple times, which is clearly a moral term. "Destroyed his life" is another strong moral statement. "Nothing happened" implies a lack of consequence, which has moral overtones. "Strong life" and "very badly" also carry emotional weight. 

Next, I have to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by noting Trump's accusations against the FBI and his comparison to Clinton. I'll mention Flynn's guilty plea and the Mueller investigation. I'll highlight Trump's emotional statements and the contrast he draws between Flynn and Clinton's outcomes. I'll also note that Trump didn't specify Clinton's lies, just that the FBI didn't charge her. Finally, I'll point out that Trump's involvement in the investigation is unusual for a president.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral framing intact. Let me piece it together step by step.

**STEP 1:**  
* Lied  
* Destroyed  
* Nothing  
* Strong  
* Badly  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the agency. Trump also accused Hillary Clinton of lying "many times" to the F.B.I. without facing consequences, while Flynn's lies led to his downfall. Flynn was fired in February after lying to the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump expressed deep sympathy for Flynn, stating, "I feel very badly" for him, while contrasting Flynn's fate with Clinton's lack of repercussions. Trump did not specify Clinton's alleged lies but noted that the F.B.I. did not charge her in 2016. The special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, is intensifying its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's public comments on the investigation are unusual for a president, as they risk appearing to influence the outcome.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
