SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining Flynn's life while highlighting the apparent double standard in the treatment of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 election. Clinton lied to the F.B.I. multiple times during the investigation into her private email server but faced no consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation circles his inner circle, and he once advised Flynn to seek immunity. The president's remarks are unusual, as presidents typically avoid influencing federal investigations. Trump laments the destruction of Flynn's life while highlighting the lack of repercussions for Clinton's deceit. END OF SUMMARY.
