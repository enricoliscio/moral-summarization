SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, stating that Flynn's life had been "destroyed" by the investigation. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election, claiming that she had lied "many times" to the FBI with no consequences. Trump's comments raise concerns about his influence on ongoing investigations, as presidents typically avoid commenting on federal inquiries to prevent the appearance of influencing their outcome. The investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller has intensified its focus on Trump's inner circle, and Flynn is the fourth associate to be charged. Trump's reference to Clinton relates to her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, for which she voluntarily interviewed with the FBI. While Trump claims Clinton lied, the FBI did not pursue charges. Trump's statement highlights his belief that Flynn has been treated unfairly, potentially influencing public perception of the investigation's integrity.
END OF SUMMARY.
