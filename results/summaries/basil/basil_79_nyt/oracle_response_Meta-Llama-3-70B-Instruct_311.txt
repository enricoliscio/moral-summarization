SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed "lied many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies to be. Clinton had given a voluntary interview to the FBI in 2016 during an investigation into her use of a private email server, and the FBI director at the time recommended no charges be filed against her. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation is focusing on his inner circle, and his weighing in on the investigation raises concerns about his attempt to influence the outcome.

END OF SUMMARY.
