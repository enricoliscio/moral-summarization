SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president contrasted Flynn's situation with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed lied "many times" to the F.B.I. without consequence. Trump implied that the F.B.I. had unfairly targeted Flynn, saying "Flynn lied and they destroyed his life." In doing so, Trump ignored the usual presidential protocol to avoid influencing the outcome of federal investigations. The special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is currently focusing on Trump's inner circle, and Trump's comments may be seen as an attempt to influence the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
