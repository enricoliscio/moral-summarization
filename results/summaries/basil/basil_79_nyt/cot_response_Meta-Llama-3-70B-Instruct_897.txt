SUMMARY:
President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president contrasted Flynn's fate with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed "lied many times" to the F.B.I. during its investigation into her email server, but faced no consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on the president's inner circle. Trump's remarks have raised eyebrows, as presidents typically avoid weighing in on federal investigations to avoid appearing to influence the outcome. Trump's moral framing of the situation pits Flynn's "destroyed" life against Clinton's impunity, sparking controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
