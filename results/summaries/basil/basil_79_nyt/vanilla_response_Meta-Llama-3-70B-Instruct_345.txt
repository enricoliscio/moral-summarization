SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump said he felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February, and criticized the FBI for "destroying his life." Trump also compared Flynn's situation to that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed "lied many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies to be. The comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing on Trump's inner circle. Presidents typically avoid commenting on federal investigations to avoid influencing the outcome.

END OF SUMMARY.
