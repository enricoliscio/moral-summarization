SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the FBI for their treatment of his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump feels that Flynn's life has been "destroyed" by the FBI, while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the presidential race, faced no consequences despite lying "many times" during an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn and lamented the apparent double standard in the FBI's handling of the two cases, suggesting that Clinton received preferential treatment. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's statement about Flynn is unusual for a president, as weighing in on federal investigations can be seen as an attempt to influence their outcome. END OF SUMMARY.
