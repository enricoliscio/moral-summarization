SUMMARY:
President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, saying he had led a "strong life" and that the FBI had "destroyed his life" over the incident. In contrast, Trump argued that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, had "lied many times" to the FBI during its investigation into her email server, but faced no consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, focuses on his inner circle. Trump's remarks are unusual, as presidents typically avoid influencing the outcome of federal investigations. By weighing in, Trump is drawing a moral distinction between Flynn's situation and Clinton's, suggesting that Flynn was unfairly treated. END OF SUMMARY.
