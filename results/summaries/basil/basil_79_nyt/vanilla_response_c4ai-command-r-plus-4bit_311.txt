SUMMARY: President Trump has expressed sympathy for Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the FBI for ruining Flynn's life while claiming that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election, faced no consequences despite lying "many times" to the FBI. Trump did not specify what he considered to be Clinton's lies during her voluntary interview with the FBI regarding her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's statement about Flynn marks a shift from his previous position, where he had encouraged Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Typically, presidents refrain from commenting on ongoing federal investigations to avoid any appearance of influencing their outcome.
END OF SUMMARY.
