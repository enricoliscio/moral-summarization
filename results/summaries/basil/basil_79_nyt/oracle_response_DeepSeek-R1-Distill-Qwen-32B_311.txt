Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific morally framed words that should be included: lying, avoid, influence, lied, happened, destroyed, cite. 

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. President Trump is criticizing the FBI for ruining Michael Flynn's life, while pointing out that Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI without facing consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump's comments come as Mueller's investigation is focusing on his inner circle. Trump feels badly for Flynn and contrasts his treatment with Clinton's, who wasn't charged despite lying. The article also mentions that Trump didn't specify what Clinton lied about.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's criticism of the FBI for ruining Flynn's life. Then, mention Trump's comparison to Clinton, noting she lied but faced no consequences. I'll include that Flynn was the fourth charged in Mueller's investigation and that Trump's comments come as the investigation focuses on his inner circle. I'll also note that Trump encouraged Flynn to seek immunity and that presidents usually avoid commenting to not influence outcomes. Finally, I'll add that Trump didn't specify Clinton's lies, and the FBI director recommended no charges.

I'll make sure to use the morally framed words: lying, lied, destroyed, influence, avoid, cite. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each point is clear and concise.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, while drawing a moral contrast to Hillary Clinton, who he claimed lied "many times" to the F.B.I. without facing consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, becoming the fourth person charged in the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating he felt "very badly" for him, while emphasizing that Flynn's treatment was unfair compared to Clinton's lack of accountability. Trump did not cite specific instances of Clinton's lies but referenced her voluntary interview with the F.B.I. in 2016, during which no charges were filed against her. The president's comments come as the special counsel's investigation intensifies its focus on his inner circle, raising questions about potential influence and the moral implications of federal investigations. END OF SUMMARY.
