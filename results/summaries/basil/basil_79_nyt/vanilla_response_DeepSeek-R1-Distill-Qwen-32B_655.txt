Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments regarding Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton. The user has given me specific instructions: the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it needs to be no longer than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump criticizing the FBI for ruining Flynn's life after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying. Trump compares this to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. Flynn was the first national security adviser and was fired by Trump after lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is investigating possible ties between Trump's associates and Russia.

I should include that Trump felt badly for Flynn and mentioned that Hillary Clinton lied but wasn't charged. Also, note that Trump typically doesn't comment on federal investigations, so this is significant.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to mention Trump's comments, Flynn's guilty plea, the comparison to Clinton, and the context of the Mueller investigation.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll start with the main points: Trump's criticism of the FBI, Flynn's situation, comparison to Clinton, and the implications of Trump's comments. Make sure it's all within the limit and flows well.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the FBI for ruining the life of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump contrasted Flynn's fate with that of Hillary Clinton, who he claimed lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. Flynn was fired in February after lying to the vice president about his interactions with the Russian ambassador. Trump's comments come amid the ongoing Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and ties to Trump associates. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating, "I feel very badly. He’s led a very strong life," while questioning why Clinton, who gave a voluntary interview in 2016, wasn’t charged. The summary ends here. END OF SUMMARY.
