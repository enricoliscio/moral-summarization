SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, who he claimed "lied many times" to the F.B.I. without consequences. Trump did not specify what Clinton said that he considered a lie. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing on his inner circle. Trump's remarks raise concerns about his attempt to influence the outcome of the investigation, which presidents typically avoid doing.

Trump's moral framing emphasizes the unfair treatment of Flynn, who "lied and they destroyed his life," while Clinton "lied many times" without repercussions. Trump's words imply that Flynn's actions were wrong, but that he was unfairly punished, while Clinton's actions were also wrong, but she escaped accountability.
