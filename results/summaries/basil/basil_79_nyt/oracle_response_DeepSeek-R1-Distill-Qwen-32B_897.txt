Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words: lying, avoid, influence, lied, happened, destroyed, cite. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is criticizing the FBI for ruining Flynn's life, while pointing out that Hillary Clinton lied but faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Trump feels badly for him. Trump also mentions that he once encouraged Flynn to seek immunity, which is against typical presidential practice to avoid influencing investigations.

I need to structure the summary to highlight Trump's criticism of the FBI's treatment of Flynn and his comparison to Clinton. I'll make sure to use the words like "lying," "destroyed," and "cite" where appropriate. I should also mention the moral implications, such as Trump's attempt to influence the investigation and the contrast between Flynn's fate and Clinton's lack of consequences.

I'll start by stating Trump's criticism, then mention Flynn's guilty plea and the ongoing investigation. I'll include Trump's emotional response and his comparison to Clinton, noting that he didn't specify her lies. I'll also touch on the unusual move of Trump encouraging Flynn for immunity, which could be seen as trying to influence the outcome.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear. I'll avoid adding any extra information not present in the article. Let me draft the summary now, making sure to incorporate all the key points and the specified moral words.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, while noting that Hillary Clinton lied "many times" to the F.B.I. but suffered no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, and Trump expressed regret for Flynn's situation, stating, "I feel very badly. He’s led a very strong life and I feel very badly." Trump also drew a contrast between Flynn’s fate and Clinton’s lack of consequences, though he did not cite specific instances of her lies. The special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, is intensifying its focus on Trump’s inner circle. Trump’s comments come amid concerns that his involvement in the case could be seen as an attempt to influence the outcome, a move that is typically avoided by presidents. Flynn’s case highlights the moral and legal implications of lying to federal authorities and the potential consequences of such actions. END OF SUMMARY.
