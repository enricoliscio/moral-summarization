SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the FBI for ruining Flynn's life while claiming that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 election, lied to the FBI multiple times without consequences. He did not specify Clinton's alleged lies. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, intensifies its focus on the president's inner circle. The president's remarks on Flynn mark a shift from his previous stance, where he encouraged Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Typically, presidents refrain from commenting on federal investigations to avoid influencing their outcome.

END OF SUMMARY.
