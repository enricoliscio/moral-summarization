Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments regarding Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

First, the article mentions that Trump criticized the FBI for ruining Flynn's life. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. He's the fourth person charged in Mueller's investigation. Trump fired Flynn in February for lying to the VP about those conversations.

Next, Trump compared Flynn's situation to Hillary Clinton, saying she lied many times but faced no consequences. He didn't specify what she lied about, but it relates to her 2016 interview with the FBI regarding her private email server as Secretary of State. Comey recommended no charges against her.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll include Trump's feelings about Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, and the context of the Mueller investigation. Also, mention that Trump's comments come as the investigation focuses on his inner circle, which is significant because presidents usually don't comment on such matters to avoid influencing the outcome.

I should structure it so it's clear and flows well. Start with Trump's criticism of the FBI and Flynn, then move to the comparison with Clinton, and end with the implications of his comments on the investigation. Make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I think this covers all necessary information succinctly.
