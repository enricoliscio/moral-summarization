SUMMARY:
President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president contrasted Flynn's fate with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed "lied many times" to the FBI but suffered no consequences. Trump argued that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result of the investigation, while Clinton was not held accountable. This comes as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing intensely on Trump's inner circle. Trump's comments have raised concerns about his potential influence on the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
