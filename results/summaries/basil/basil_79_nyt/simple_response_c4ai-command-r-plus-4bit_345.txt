SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the FBI for ruining Flynn's life while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the presidential race, faced no consequences despite lying "many times" to the FBI during their investigation into her private email server usage. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation circles his inner circle. He once advised Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Trump's sympathy for Flynn and criticism of Clinton highlight a double standard in the treatment of the two figures, with Flynn's life allegedly "destroyed" while Clinton faced no repercussions for her actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
