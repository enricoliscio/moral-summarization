SUMMARY: President Trump has commented on the recent charges against his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating that his life had been "destroyed" by the F.B.I., while also accusing Hillary Clinton of lying to the F.B.I. "many times" without consequences. Trump did not provide specific examples of Clinton's alleged lies. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's sympathy for Flynn and criticism of Clinton highlight his selective interpretation of justice, as he ignores the severity of Flynn's actions and his own adviser's lies while attempting to influence the outcome of federal investigations.

END OF SUMMARY.
