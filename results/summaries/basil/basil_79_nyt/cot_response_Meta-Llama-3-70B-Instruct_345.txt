SUMMARY:
President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, who he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president contrasted Flynn's situation with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed "lied many times" to the F.B.I. during its investigation into her email server, but faced no consequences. Trump argued that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result of his lie, while Clinton's dishonesty went unpunished. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates is intensifying its focus on his inner circle.
