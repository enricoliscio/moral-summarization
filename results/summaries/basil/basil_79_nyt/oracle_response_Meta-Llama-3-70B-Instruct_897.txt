SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of Hillary Clinton, claiming she lied "many times" to the FBI but suffered no consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies to be. This comes as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, focuses on Trump's inner circle. Trump's comments raise concerns about influencing the outcome of the investigation, which presidents typically avoid. Trump's remarks highlight the perceived unfairness of Flynn's situation, where he lied and had his life "destroyed," while Clinton lied and "nothing happened" to her.
