SUMMARY:

President Trump has expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump feels "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president contrasted Flynn's fate with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claims lied "many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates is intensifying its focus on his inner circle.

The moral framing of this article suggests that Trump is attempting to deflect attention from his own administration's scandals by pointing fingers at his political opponents. By claiming that Clinton lied to the FBI with impunity, Trump is implying that the justice system is unfair and biased against him and his associates. This narrative is problematic, as it seeks to undermine the integrity of the FBI and the special counsel investigation, and perpetuates a culture of blame-shifting and dishonesty.

END OF SUMMARY.
