SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump stated that he feels "very badly" for Flynn, who he fired in February for lying to the vice president. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming that she lied "many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what Clinton said that he considered a lie. Clinton had given a voluntary interview to the FBI in 2016 during an investigation into her use of a private email server, and the FBI director at the time recommended no charges be filed against her.

Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, is focusing on his inner circle. Trump had previously encouraged Flynn to seek an immunity deal. The president's remarks are unusual, as presidents typically avoid commenting on federal investigations to avoid influencing the outcome.

END OF SUMMARY.
