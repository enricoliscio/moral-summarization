SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump drew a moral contrast between Flynn's situation and that of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, claiming she lied multiple times to the F.B.I. without consequences. Trump decried the double standard, arguing that Flynn's life was destroyed while Clinton suffered no repercussions. Flynn is the fourth person charged in the special counsel's investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia. The President's comments on Flynn come amid the investigation's focus on his inner circle. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, previously encouraging him to seek immunity. Presidents typically refrain from commenting on federal investigations to avoid influencing outcomes. Trump's statements highlight his concerns about the investigation's impact on Flynn and the perceived lack of consequences for Clinton.
