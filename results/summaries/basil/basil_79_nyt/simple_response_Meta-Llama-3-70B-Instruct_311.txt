SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, saying his life was "ruined" by the agency. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claimed lied "many times" to the FBI without facing consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on the president's inner circle. Trump's remarks are seen as unusual, as presidents typically avoid influencing the outcome of federal investigations. The moral framing of Trump's statement implies that the justice system is unfair, with Clinton receiving preferential treatment while Flynn is harshly punished.
