SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, saying that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result. Trump contrasted Flynn's situation with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, whom he claimed "lied many times to the FBI" without facing consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, is intensifying its focus on Trump's inner circle. Notably, Trump's remarks depart from the typical presidential practice of avoiding comments on federal investigations to prevent the appearance of influencing the outcome.

Trump's moral framing implies that there is a double standard at play, where Flynn, a Trump associate, is being unfairly punished for his actions, while Clinton, a political opponent, was let off scot-free despite allegedly committing similar offenses. This framing suggests that the justice system is biased against Trump and his allies.
