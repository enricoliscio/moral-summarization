SUMMARY:

President Trump sympathized with his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, saying that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result. Trump contrasted Flynn's fate with that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of lying to the FBI "many times" without consequence. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's remarks are notable because presidents typically avoid commenting on ongoing federal investigations to avoid influencing the outcome.

Trump's comparison between Flynn and Clinton implies that the justice system is unfair, with some individuals facing severe consequences for their actions while others, like Clinton, escape accountability. This framing suggests that Trump believes the system is biased against him and his associates.
