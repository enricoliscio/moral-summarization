Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Trump commenting on Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton's interactions with the FBI.

First, I need to identify the main points. Trump is criticizing the FBI for ruining Flynn's life. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. He's the fourth person charged in Mueller's investigation. Trump fired Flynn in February for lying to the vice president.

Also, Trump is comparing this to Hillary Clinton, saying she lied many times but faced no consequences. He mentions that Clinton gave a voluntary interview in 2016 and the FBI's director recommended no charges. I should note that Trump didn't specify what Clinton lied about.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating Trump's criticism of the FBI towards Flynn, then mention Flynn's guilty plea and his position. Next, I'll note Trump's comparison to Clinton, her interview, and the lack of charges. Finally, I'll add that Trump didn't specify her lies and that his comments come during the ongoing Mueller investigation.

I should make sure the summary is concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me put it all together in a clear, straightforward manner.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the FBI for ruining the life of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Flynn is the fourth person charged in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election interference and ties to Trump associates. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whom he fired in February, and contrasted his treatment with that of Hillary Clinton, who he accused of lying to the FBI multiple times without facing consequences. Clinton had given a voluntary interview in 2016 during the FBI's investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state, after which the FBI director recommended no charges. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies. His comments came as Mueller's probe intensifies focus on Trump's inner circle. END OF SUMMARY.
