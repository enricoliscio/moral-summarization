Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump commenting on the F.B.I.'s handling of Michael Flynn's case. Trump feels sorry for Flynn because he lied to the F.B.I., which led to his downfall. Trump contrasts this with Hillary Clinton, who also lied to the F.B.I. but faced no consequences. The author used words like "lying," "avoid," "influence," "lied," "happened," "destroyed," and "cite." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key events: Flynn's guilty plea, Trump's comments, the comparison to Clinton, and the context of the Mueller investigation. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the morally framed words.

Let me structure the summary. Begin with Trump's comments on Flynn, mention the lying and the consequences. Then contrast with Clinton's situation, using "lied" and "nothing happened." Also, note that Trump didn't specify her lies. End with the context of the Mueller probe and Trump's unusual involvement.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary points without being too wordy. Let me draft it and check the word count. Also, ensure that the moral framing words are preserved as per the user's request.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key points are covered. Make sure it's clear and concise, maintaining the moral perspective from the original article.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the F.B.I. for "destroying" Flynn's life, while noting that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, lied "many times" to the F.B.I. during the 2016 investigation into her use of a private email server but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies. The special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, is intensifying its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's comments come despite the typical practice for presidents to avoid influencing federal investigations. END OF SUMMARY.
