SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "ruined" by the FBI, while his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, lied "many times" to the FBI without facing consequences. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, intensifies its focus on the president's inner circle. Trump's remarks are seen as an attempt to influence the outcome of the investigation, which is unusual for a president. The moral framing of Trump's statement implies that the justice system is unfair and biased, with Clinton being let off scot-free despite her alleged lies, while Flynn's life is destroyed for a similar offense.

END OF SUMMARY.
