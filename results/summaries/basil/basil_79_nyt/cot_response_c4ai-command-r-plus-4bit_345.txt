SUMMARY: President Trump has come out to express his sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump feels that Flynn's life has been unjustly ruined by the F.B.I., contrasting Flynn's situation with that of Hillary Clinton, who lied to the F.B.I. multiple times during their investigation into her private email server but faced no consequences. The President believes Clinton's lies far outweighed Flynn's, yet Flynn's life has been destroyed while Clinton suffered nothing. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation circles his inner circle, and he laments the double standard in the treatment of Flynn and Clinton by the F.B.I. and the justice system.
