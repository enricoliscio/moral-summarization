SUMMARY: President Trump commented on the FBI's investigation of his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he accused of lying to the FBI multiple times without consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating that the FBI "destroyed his life," while Clinton faced no repercussions. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's remarks on Flynn raise ethical concerns as presidents typically avoid influencing federal investigations. Trump did not provide specific examples of Clinton's alleged lies, referring to her voluntary interview with the FBI regarding her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.
