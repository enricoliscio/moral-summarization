SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the FBI for their treatment of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating that his life has been "destroyed" by the FBI while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, faced no consequences despite lying "many times" to the FBI during their investigation into her private email server usage. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. The president's sympathy for Flynn and criticism of Clinton highlight his concerns about the perceived injustice in their respective treatments by the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
