SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining Flynn's life while highlighting the contrasting outcome for Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, who lied to the F.B.I. multiple times during their investigation into her private email server but faced no consequences. Trump's comments raise concerns about his influence on federal investigations and his selective avoidance of moral judgment. The president's sympathy for Flynn and criticism of the F.B.I. and Clinton demonstrate a biased perspective that could influence the perception of the special counsel investigation currently focusing on Trump's inner circle.

END OF SUMMARY.
