SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump said he felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. The president compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, claiming she lied "many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered Clinton's lies to be. Clinton had given a voluntary interview to the FBI in 2016 during an investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state, and the FBI director at the time recommended no charges be filed against her.

Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing on the president's inner circle. Trump had previously encouraged Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Presidents typically avoid weighing in on federal investigations to avoid influencing the outcome.
