SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claims lied to the FBI multiple times without consequences. Trump did not specify what he believed Clinton lied about, referring to her voluntary interview with the FBI in 2016 regarding her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on the president's inner circle. He previously encouraged Flynn to seek an immunity deal, breaking with the tradition of presidents avoiding comments on federal investigations. Trump's statement highlights his view of the differing treatment of Flynn and Clinton by the FBI.
END OF SUMMARY.
