Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

President Trump is talking about how the FBI treated Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Trump feels sorry for him, saying the FBI destroyed his life. Trump also compares this to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. He mentions that Flynn was the fourth person charged in Mueller's investigation, which is focusing on Trump's inner circle. Trump's comments are unusual because presidents usually don't comment on such investigations to avoid influencing the outcome.

I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's criticism of the FBI's handling of Flynn and his comparison to Clinton. It's important to note that Trump is highlighting a double standard, which is the moral framing here. I should also mention that Trump didn't specify what Clinton lied about, just that she lied many times and wasn't charged.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's comments on Flynn, then his comparison to Clinton, and finally the context of the Mueller investigation. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral perspective is clear.

Let me draft that. Make sure to include all key points: Trump's empathy for Flynn, the contrast with Clinton, Flynn's guilty plea, Mueller's investigation, and the unusual nature of Trump's comments.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the agency. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating that while Flynn lied, Hillary Clinton also lied "many times" to the F.B.I. but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify Clinton's alleged lies, which occurred during her voluntary interview in 2016 regarding her use of a private email server. Flynn's case is part of the ongoing investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel probing Russia's influence on the 2016 election and ties to Trump associates. Trump's comments came as the investigation intensifies focus on his inner circle, marking an unusual public stance for a president on an active federal inquiry. END OF SUMMARY.
