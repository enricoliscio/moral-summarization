Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump's comments on Flynn and Clinton. I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's perspective, especially his comparison between Flynn's treatment and Clinton's lack of consequences. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Trump's feelings for Flynn, the fact that Flynn pleaded guilty, the Mueller investigation, and the comparison to Clinton. Also, I need to note that Trump didn't specify what Clinton lied about and the outcome of her case. I should structure it to highlight the moral angle Trump is emphasizing, showing his criticism of the FBI's handling of Flynn versus Clinton. Let me make sure the summary flows well and includes all necessary details without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that the F.B.I. "destroyed his life" after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump contrasted Flynn's fate with that of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, who he claimed lied "many times" to the F.B.I. during their investigation into her private email server but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what Clinton allegedly lied about, though she gave a voluntary interview in 2016 and was ultimately not charged. Flynn's case is part of the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to Trump associates. Trump's comments came as the Mueller probe intensifies its focus on his inner circle, despite his encouragement for Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Trump's remarks highlight his criticism of the F.B.I. and the Mueller investigation, emphasizing what he perceives as unequal treatment of Flynn compared to Clinton. END OF SUMMARY.
