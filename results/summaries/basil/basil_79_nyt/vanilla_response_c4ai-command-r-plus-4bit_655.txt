SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the FBI for its treatment of his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump compared Flynn's situation to that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who he claims lied to the FBI multiple times without consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn and stated that the FBI "destroyed his life." He did not specify what he believed Clinton had lied about, but referenced her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The president's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, intensifies its focus on Trump's inner circle. Trump's statement is unusual for a president, as they typically avoid commenting on federal investigations to prevent the appearance of influencing their outcome.
END OF SUMMARY.
