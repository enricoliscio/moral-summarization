SUMMARY:

President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February, and claimed that Flynn's life was "destroyed" as a result. Trump also compared Flynn's situation to that of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election, saying that she lied "many times" to the FBI but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify what he considered to be Clinton's lies. Clinton had given a voluntary interview to the FBI in 2016 during an investigation into her use of a private email server, and the FBI director at the time recommended no charges be filed against her.

END OF SUMMARY.
