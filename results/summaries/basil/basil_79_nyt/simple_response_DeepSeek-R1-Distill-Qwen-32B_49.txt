Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about President Trump commenting on the treatment of Michael Flynn compared to Hillary Clinton. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is saying the FBI destroyed Flynn's life because he lied, but Hillary Clinton lied many times and faced no consequences. Flynn was charged as part of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn and criticized the FBI's handling of the situation, drawing a contrast between Flynn and Clinton's treatment.

I need to make sure the summary includes Trump's comments, the context of Flynn's guilty plea, Mueller's investigation, and the comparison to Clinton. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight Trump's criticism of the FBI's actions and his implication that the treatment was unfair.

I'll start by stating Trump's main point about Flynn and Clinton. Then mention Flynn's guilty plea and Mueller's investigation. Include Trump's sympathy and the comparison. Finally, note that Trump didn't specify Clinton's lies but pointed out she faced no charges.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key elements. Make sure the summary flows logically and captures the moral perspective Trump is presenting.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the agency about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump contrasted Flynn's treatment with that of Hillary Clinton, who he claimed lied "many times" to the F.B.I. during their investigation into her private email server but faced no consequences. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whom he fired in February, and suggested the special counsel's investigation, led by Robert Mueller, unfairly targeted his inner circle. Trump's comments highlight his frustration with the investigation and his perception of unequal treatment between Flynn and Clinton. END OF SUMMARY.
