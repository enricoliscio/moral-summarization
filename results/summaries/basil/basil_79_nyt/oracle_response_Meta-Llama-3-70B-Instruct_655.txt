SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump felt "very badly" for Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president. In contrast, Trump claimed that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, lied "many times" to the FBI during its investigation into her private email server, but faced no consequences. Trump implied that the FBI's treatment of Flynn was unfair, stating "Flynn lied and they destroyed his life." Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing intensely on the president's inner circle. Trump's remarks raise concerns about his attempt to influence the outcome of the investigation, which presidents typically avoid doing. By weighing in on the case, Trump may be seen as trying to sway public opinion and undermine the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
