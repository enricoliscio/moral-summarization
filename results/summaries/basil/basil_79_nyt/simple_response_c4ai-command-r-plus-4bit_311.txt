SUMMARY: President Trump has once again demonstrated his disregard for the integrity of federal investigations and the rule of law, this time by commenting on the ongoing case involving his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, a development that should be of grave concern to any American who values national security and the truth. Yet, Trump's response is to express sympathy for Flynn and to make unfounded accusations against Hillary Clinton, his former political opponent. Trump claims Clinton lied "many times" to the F.B.I., despite no evidence of this, while ignoring the fact that Flynn's actions compromised his position and endangered national security. This is a blatant attempt to divert attention and minimize the seriousness of Flynn's actions and the ongoing investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 election. It is morally reprehensible and a betrayal of the public trust for the president to use his position to influence public opinion and undermine the justice system.

END OF SUMMARY.
