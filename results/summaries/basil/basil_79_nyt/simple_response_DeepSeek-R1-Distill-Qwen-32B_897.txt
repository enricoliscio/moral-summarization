Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points and the moral perspective.

The article is about President Trump commenting on the treatment of Michael Flynn and comparing it to Hillary Clinton's situation. Trump feels sorry for Flynn, saying the FBI ruined his life, while Clinton lied many times but faced no consequences. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, and he's the fourth person charged in Mueller's investigation. Trump also mentioned encouraging Flynn to seek an immunity deal, which is unusual for a president to do because it might seem like influencing the investigation.

The moral framing here seems to be about fairness and justice. Trump is implying that the FBI treated Flynn harshly while letting Clinton off the hook, suggesting a double standard. The author presents this as a point of contention, highlighting Trump's criticism of the investigation process.

I need to capture all these elements in a concise summary. I should mention Trump's feelings for Flynn, the comparison to Clinton, the context of the Mueller investigation, and the implication of a double standard. I should also note that Trump's involvement in Flynn's case is unusual.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's comments on Flynn and the comparison to Clinton, then mention the context of the Mueller investigation, the fact that Flynn is the fourth charged, Trump's encouragement for an immunity deal, and the implication of unfair treatment. Keep it under 200 words.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, but include the moral angle by highlighting the perceived unfairness.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to include all these points concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, stating that the agency "destroyed his life." Trump contrasted Flynn's treatment with that of Hillary Clinton, who he claims lied to the FBI multiple times without facing consequences. Flynn's case is part of the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and Trump associates. Trump unusually encouraged Flynn to seek an immunity deal, a move that could appear to influence the investigation. The president's comments highlight a perceived double standard in how Flynn and Clinton were treated by the FBI, suggesting unfairness in their respective outcomes. END OF SUMMARY.
