SUMMARY: President Trump commented on the FBI investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, stating that his life had been "destroyed" by the FBI, while claiming that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, had lied to the FBI multiple times without consequences. Trump's comments raise concerns about his influence on the special counsel investigation, which is currently focusing on his inner circle. The president's sympathy for Flynn, who lied to the FBI, and his accusation against Clinton, for which he provided no specific evidence, highlight a double standard and a potential abuse of power.

END OF SUMMARY.
