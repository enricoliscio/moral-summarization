SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump claimed that Flynn's life was "destroyed" by the FBI, while his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, faced no consequences despite lying "many times." This comparison raises moral questions about fairness and equal treatment under the law. Trump's comments could be seen as an attempt to shift blame and discredit the ongoing investigation, which is now focusing on his inner circle. The president's intervention is unusual and may be seen as an attempt to influence the outcome of the investigation. It is essential to consider the implications of his statements and whether they undermine the principles of justice and equality that the law should uphold. Trump's sympathy for Flynn and criticism of Clinton's treatment raise questions about the moral integrity of the justice system and the potential influence of political power on legal outcomes.
END OF SUMMARY.
