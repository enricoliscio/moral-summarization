SUMMARY: President Trump expressed sympathy for his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump criticized the FBI for ruining Flynn's life while claiming that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, lied to the FBI multiple times with no consequences. Trump did not specify what he believed Clinton had lied about, referring to her voluntary interview with the FBI in 2016 regarding her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Trump's comments come as the special counsel investigation, led by Robert Mueller, intensifies its focus on the president's inner circle. Trump's statement about Flynn contrasts with his previous encouragement for Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Typically, presidents avoid commenting on federal investigations to prevent any appearance of influencing their outcome.
END OF SUMMARY.
