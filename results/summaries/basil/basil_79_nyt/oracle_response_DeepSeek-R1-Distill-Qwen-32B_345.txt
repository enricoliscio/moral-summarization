Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words used by the author. The article is about President Trump's comments regarding Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump criticized the FBI for ruining Flynn's life after he lied. He also compared this to Hillary Clinton, who lied to the FBI but faced no consequences. The article mentions that Trump typically doesn't comment on federal investigations but made an exception here. Flynn pleaded guilty, and Trump suggested he seek immunity. The special counsel's investigation is focusing on Trump's inner circle.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: lying, avoid, influence, lied, happened, destroyed, cite. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll start by stating Trump's criticism of the FBI's treatment of Flynn, using "lying" and "destroyed." Then, mention his comparison to Clinton, using "lied" and "nothing happened." I'll note that Trump didn't specify her lies but referred to her interview. Finally, I'll include that Trump usually avoids influencing investigations but made an exception, using "avoid" and "influence."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it concisely, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized the F.B.I. for ruining the life of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump expressed sympathy for Flynn, whom he fired for lying to the vice president, and compared the situation to Hillary Clinton, who he claimed lied many times to the F.B.I. but faced no consequences. Trump did not specify Clinton's alleged lies but referenced her voluntary interview during the F.B.I.'s investigation into her private email server. The president's comments came as the special counsel's investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 election intensifies, focusing on Trump's inner circle. Trump, who typically avoids influencing federal investigations, suggested Flynn seek an immunity deal, highlighting the moral contrast he drew between Flynn's fate and Clinton's lack of accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
