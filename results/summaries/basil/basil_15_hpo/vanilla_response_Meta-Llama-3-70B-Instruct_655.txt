SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a cover of Michele Bachmann with a headline that reads "THE QUEEN OF RAGE". The cover has sparked controversy, with conservative websites claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. The article inside the magazine does not use the word "rage" to describe Bachmann, but rather criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party she champions. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and Sarah Palin in a controversial cover in 2009. The Bachmann cover has sparked debate over whether it crosses a line and if the mainstream media is biased against conservatives.

END OF SUMMARY.
