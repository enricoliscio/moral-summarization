Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The user provided specific morally framed words: advertising, reads, biased, portrayed. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read the article to understand the context. Newsweek's cover is causing controversy. The headline is "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," but the word "rage" isn't in the actual article. Lois Romano criticizes Bachmann's support for the Tea Party as radical. Conservatives are upset, saying it makes Bachmann look crazy and accuses the media of bias. Newsweek has had similar issues before with Romney and Palin covers.

Now, I need to craft a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the cover and the headline. Then note that "rage" isn't in the article but the author criticizes Bachmann's radical Tea Party support. Next, mention the conservative backlash, using "biased" and "portrayed." I'll also include past controversies with Romney and Palin. Finally, ask if the cover crosses a line, using "advertising" and "reads."

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while keeping it concise. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.
