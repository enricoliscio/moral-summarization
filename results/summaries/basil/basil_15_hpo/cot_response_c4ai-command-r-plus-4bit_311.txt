* SUMMERY:
The latest issue of Newsweek is stirring up *controversy* with its cover featuring Michele Bachmann. The cover, which depicts Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background, has been labeled by some conservative websites as making her look "crazy." The headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" has also come under fire, with critics arguing that the word "rage" was used to *cry foul* and paint Bachmann and the Tea Party in a negative light.

This is not the first time Newsweek has faced *backlash* from conservatives over its cover choices. In the past, covers featuring Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin have also drawn *infamous* criticism and accusations of *bias* against conservatives. The magazine's portrayal of Romney as a character from "The Book of Mormon" and its controversial cover of Palin in 2009 sparked similar debates.

The Bachmann cover has once again ignited discussions about the media's treatment of conservative figures and the ethical boundaries of journalism. Critics are questioning whether the cover crosses a line in its depiction of a prominent political figure.
