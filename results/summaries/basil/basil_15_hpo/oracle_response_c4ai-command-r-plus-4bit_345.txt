SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue is sure to spark controversy with its cover featuring Michele Bachmann, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The headline advertising the story uses the word "rage," a term not present in the actual profile, to describe the Tea Party that Bachmann supports. This has sparked backlash from conservative websites, accusing the magazine of portraying Bachmann in a negative light and questioning the mainstream media's bias against conservatives. The issue draws comparisons to previous controversial Newsweek covers, including one featuring Mitt Romney and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009, which also faced conservative criticism. The Bachmann cover has sparked a debate about the ethical boundaries of media representation. Does it cross a line? You decide.
END OF SUMMARY.
