SUMMARY: Newsweek is no stranger to conservative backlash for its cover stories, and its latest issue featuring Michele Bachmann is no exception. The cover, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," is sure to spark controversy. While the word "rage" is not used in the actual profile of Bachmann, the author criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann represents. Conservative websites have already cried foul, accusing the magazine of bias and portraying Bachmann in a negative light, with some saying it makes her look "crazy." This is reminiscent of previous controversies, including the Mitt Romney cover that portrayed him as a character from "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The Bachmann cover has sparked debate about whether it crosses a line in terms of bias and fairness in media.

END OF SUMMARY.
