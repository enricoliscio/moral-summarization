Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given Newsweek article. The user is asking for a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main elements. It's about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover is causing controversy, especially among conservatives who feel it's biased. The article mentions that the word "rage" isn't in the actual profile but criticizes Bachmann's Tea Party stance. There's also mention of past controversial covers, like Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the cover's title and Bachmann's image. Then, note the conservative backlash and the criticism of bias. I'll mention the absence of "rage" in the article and the historical context of Newsweek's controversial covers. Finally, I'll include the call for opinions on whether the cover crosses a line.

I should ensure the summary is clear and covers all main points without unnecessary details. Keeping it concise but informative is key. Also, ending with the call for opinions adds context about the ongoing debate.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover features Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," sparking controversy. The cover image shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background, while the magazine's profile by Lois Romano criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, though it doesn't use the word "rage." Conservative websites are criticizing the cover, calling it biased and suggesting it portrays Bachmann as "crazy." This isn't the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers; previous controversial issues included portrayals of Mitt Romney as a character from "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous 2009 Sarah Palin cover. The article invites readers to share their opinions on whether the Bachmann cover crosses a line. END OF SUMMARY.
