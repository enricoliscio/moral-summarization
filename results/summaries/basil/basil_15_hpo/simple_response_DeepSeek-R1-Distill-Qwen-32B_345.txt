Okay, so the user has provided a news article about Newsweek's Michele Bachmann cover and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They also mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The cover features Bachmann with a "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" headline, even though the word "rage" isn't in the article. Lois Romano criticizes the Tea Party's radical nature, and conservatives are upset, calling it biased. Newsweek has had similar issues before with Romney and Palin covers.

I should make sure the summary highlights the controversy, the conservative backlash, and the comparison to past covers. Also, the moral aspect is about media bias and fairness. So, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, keeping it concise under 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning the cover and headline, then note the absence of "rage" in the article. Next, I'll describe the conservative reaction, including the blogger's quote about bias. Then, I'll reference the previous controversial covers to show a pattern. Finally, I'll end by asking if the cover crosses a line, as in the original article.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures the essence without adding personal opinions. Keeping it factual but highlighting the moral framing about media bias is crucial.
