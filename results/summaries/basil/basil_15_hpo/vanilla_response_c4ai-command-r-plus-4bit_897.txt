SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover has drawn criticism from conservative websites, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin in a negative light. The Bachmann cover has sparked debate over the media's portrayal of conservative figures and the ethics of sensationalism in news coverage.
