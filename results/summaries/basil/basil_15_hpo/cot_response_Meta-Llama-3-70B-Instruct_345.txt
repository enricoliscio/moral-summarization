SUMMARY:
Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" and a photo of Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression. The article's author, Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. Conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being "biased" against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous examples including a portrayal of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and an infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The question remains whether the cover crosses a line. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate about media bias and the portrayal of conservative politicians.
