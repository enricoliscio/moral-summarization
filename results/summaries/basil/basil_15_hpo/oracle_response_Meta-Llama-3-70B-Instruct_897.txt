SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," which is already sparking outrage among conservatives. The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have drawn criticism, with some claiming it makes her look "crazy." The accompanying article by Lois Romano criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover; previous examples include a depiction of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The magazine's advertising tactics have been called into question, with some arguing that the mainstream media is biased against conservatives. The cover's provocative headline reads like a sensationalized portrayal of Bachmann, fueling accusations of bias.
