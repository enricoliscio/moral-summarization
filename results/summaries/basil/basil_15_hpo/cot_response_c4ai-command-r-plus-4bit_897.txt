SUMMARY:
The latest Newsweek issue featuring Michele Bachmann on the cover is stirring up controversy, especially among conservatives. The cover, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," depicts Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, and while the word "rage" doesn't appear in the profile, it criticizes the "radical" Tea Party she champions. Conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the cover makes Bachmann look crazy and alleging media bias against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a controversial light and drawing infamy for its 2009 Sarah Palin cover. The magazine's approach to covering conservative figures raises questions about media bias and the ethical boundaries of newsworthiness.
