SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, labeling her as "THE QUEEN OF RAGE". The cover photo shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background. Conservative websites are criticizing the cover, claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and Sarah Palin in a controversial 2009 cover. The article inside Newsweek criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. The cover has sparked debate over whether it crosses a line and if the media is biased against conservatives.
