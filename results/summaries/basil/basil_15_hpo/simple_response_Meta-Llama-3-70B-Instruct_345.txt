SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with critics accusing the magazine of bias against conservatives. The cover shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, accompanied by the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." Conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the image makes Bachmann look "crazy" and perpetuates a biased narrative. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers, with previous examples including Mitt Romney being portrayed as a star of "The Book of Mormon" and Sarah Palin's infamous 2009 cover. The moral of the story is that the media has a responsibility to present fair and balanced representations of public figures, rather than sensationalized and biased portrayals that can be damaging to their reputation and the public's perception of them.
