SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a cover of Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE", which has sparked controversy among conservatives. The cover shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background, looking directly into the camera. Conservative websites have criticized the cover, saying it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous examples including a Mitt Romney cover in June and a Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The article inside the magazine, written by Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. The cover has sparked debate over whether it crosses a line and is an example of media bias.
