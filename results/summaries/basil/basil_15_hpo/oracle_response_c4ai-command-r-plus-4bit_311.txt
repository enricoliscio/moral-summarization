SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover has stirred up backlash from conservative websites, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accuses the magazine of being biased against conservatives. The word "rage" doesn't appear in the actual profile of Bachmann, written by Lois Romano, who criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann represents. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced conservative criticism for its cover choices; previous examples include a Mitt Romney cover portraying him as a character from "The Book of Mormon" musical, and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The magazine is no stranger to controversy, and this Bachmann cover is sure to spark further debate about the media's portrayal of conservative figures.

END OF SUMMARY.
