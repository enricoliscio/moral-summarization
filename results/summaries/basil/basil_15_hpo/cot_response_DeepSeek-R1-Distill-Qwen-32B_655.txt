Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context and the key points.

The article is about a Newsweek cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover is causing controversy. The user wants me to identify the morally framed words and then write a summary that includes those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to find all single words that carry moral connotations. Let's go through the article:

- "controversy" – implies disagreement or dispute, which is a moral issue.
- "stark" – maybe not inherently moral, but in context, it could suggest something intense or severe.
- "wide-eyed" – could imply innocence or surprise, but in a cover, it might be used to make someone look intense or angry.
- "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" – "rage" is definitely a moral term, indicating anger or extreme emotion.
- "radical" – implies extreme views, which can be seen as morally charged.
- "crazy" – clearly a negative moral judgment.
- "biased" – relates to fairness and impartiality, a moral concept.
- "backlash" – implies a strong negative reaction, which is moral.
- "portrayed" – could be neutral, but in context, it's about how someone is represented, which can have moral implications.
- "criticism" – negative judgment, moral framing.
- "infamous" – implies notoriety, which is negative.

Wait, but the user specified single words, so I should list each as individual points. I think I might have missed some. Let me go through the article again.

The cover is "stark," which might not be moral, but "controversy" is. "Wide-eyed" could be neutral, but in the context of a cover, it's used to portray Bachmann in a certain light, so maybe it's part of the moral framing. "Rage" is definitely moral. "Radical" is moral because it's about extreme views. "Crazy" is a moral judgment. "Biased" is about fairness, so moral. "Backlash" is a negative reaction, so moral. "Portrayed" might not be, but in context, it's about how Romney was shown as a star, which could be seen as mocking, so maybe moral. "Criticism" is moral. "Infamous" is negative, so moral.

Wait, but the user said to list each single word. So I should list each word that carries a moral connotation. Let me make sure I don't miss any.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the article.

I'll start by mentioning the cover and the headline, then the criticism from conservatives, the comparison to past covers, and end with a question about bias.

I should make sure to include words like "controversy," "stark," "rage," "radical," "crazy," "biased," "backlash," "criticism," and "infamous." But I need to check if they fit naturally in the summary.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow from the cover's description, to the reactions, and then to the historical context of Newsweek's previous controversial covers. Finally, I'll end with the question about bias.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing as per the user's request.

* infamous  

**SUMMARY:**  

Newsweek's latest cover features Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," sparking controversy. The cover shows Bachmann against a stark blue background, with a wide-eyed expression, implying intensity. While the word "rage" doesn't appear in the article, author Lois Romano criticizes Bachmann's support for the "radical" Tea Party. Conservative websites are calling the cover biased, with some claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy." This isn't the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers. Previously, it portrayed Mitt Romney as a star from "The Book of Mormon" and drew criticism for its infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The争议 over Bachmann's cover highlights ongoing debates about media bias and how public figures are portrayed. END OF SUMMARY.
