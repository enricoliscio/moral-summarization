SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," which has sparked outrage among conservatives. The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have been criticized for making her appear "crazy." Author Lois Romano's profile of Bachmann inside the magazine critiques the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. Conservative websites are crying foul, accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover; previous examples include a depiction of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The cover's advertising of Bachmann as the "Queen of Rage" reads as a deliberate attempt to portray her in a negative light, fueling accusations of bias. END OF SUMMARY.
