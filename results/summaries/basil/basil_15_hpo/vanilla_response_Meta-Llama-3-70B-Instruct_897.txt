SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a cover of Michele Bachmann with a headline that reads "THE QUEEN OF RAGE", which is sparking controversy. The cover photo shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background. Conservative websites are criticizing the cover, claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a Broadway show and Sarah Palin in a controversial cover in 2009. The article's author, Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions, but the word "rage" does not appear in the actual profile. The cover has sparked debate over whether it crosses a line and if the media is biased against conservatives.
