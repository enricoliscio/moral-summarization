SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The cover has drawn criticism from conservative websites, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin in a negative light. The Bachmann cover story, written by Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann champions. The word "rage" does not appear in the actual profile, adding fuel to the fire of conservative critics. The magazine's past controversial covers have also sparked similar debates about media bias and unfair representation of conservative figures. The Bachmann cover has sparked a debate about the ethical boundaries of magazine covers and the representation of political figures.
