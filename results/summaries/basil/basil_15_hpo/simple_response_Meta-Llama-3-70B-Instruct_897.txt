SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" and a photo of Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression. Conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a Broadway show and Sarah Palin in a controversial light. The author of the profile, Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. The cover has sparked a heated debate about media bias and the portrayal of conservative politicians.

The moral framing of this article suggests that the media has a responsibility to portray public figures in a fair and unbiased manner. The use of sensational language and provocative imagery can be seen as a breach of this responsibility, and can contribute to the erosion of trust in the media.
