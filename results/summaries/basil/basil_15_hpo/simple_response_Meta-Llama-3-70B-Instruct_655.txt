SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" and a photo of Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression. Conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous examples including a depiction of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and a controversial Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The cover's language and imagery have been criticized for being sensational and unfair, perpetuating a negative stereotype of Bachmann and the Tea Party movement. The incident raises questions about media bias and the responsibility of journalists to present fair and balanced portrayals of political figures.
