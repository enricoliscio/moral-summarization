Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided an article about Newsweek's Michele Bachmann cover. They want me to identify the morally framed words and then write a summary using those words.

Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "controversy," "stark," "radical," "crazy," "biased," "backlash," "infamous," and "crosses a line" stand out. These words aren't just neutral; they imply judgment or evaluation.

Next, I have to write a concise summary. I should include these morally framed words to maintain the original tone. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the cover's controversy, the headline, the criticism from conservatives, and the comparison to past covers.

I should start by mentioning the cover's impact, then the headline and its implications. Then, I'll note the conservative reaction, including the blogger's quote about bias. Finally, I'll reference the previous controversial covers to show a pattern. I'll end by asking if the cover crosses a line, as in the original.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. I'll also ensure that the morally framed words are integrated naturally to preserve the article's tone.

Let me put it all together, making sure each part is clear and concise. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. That should cover everything the user asked for.

**STEP 1:**  
* Controversy  
* Radical  
* Crazy  
* Biased  
* Backlash  
* Infamous  
* Crosses a line  

**SUMMARY:**  
Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" drawing criticism. While the article by Lois Romano critiques Bachmann's association with the "radical" Tea Party, the cover has been accused of making Bachmann look "crazy." Conservative outlets are calling the magazine "biased" against conservatives, echoing past criticism over controversial covers, such as the 2009 Sarah Palin issue and a June portrayal of Mitt Romney. The cover has reignited debates about media bias, with some questioning whether Newsweek's approach "crosses a line." END OF SUMMARY.
