SUMMARY:
Newsweek is no stranger to conservative backlash, and its latest issue featuring Michele Bachmann is no exception. The cover, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," portrays Bachmann in a controversial light, with a wide-eyed expression that some critics argue makes her look "crazy." The article itself criticizes Bachmann's association with the Tea Party, referring to it as "radical." This has sparked fierce controversy, with conservative websites crying foul and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced such backlash; previous covers featuring Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin also drew biased criticism and moral outrage. The pattern raises questions about the magazine's portrayal of conservative figures and the ethical boundaries of media representation.
