Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Newsweek's Michele Bachmann cover. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Newsweek's latest issue has a cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover shows her against a blue background, looking intense. The headline is causing controversy, even though the word "rage" isn't in the actual article. Lois Romano, the author, criticizes Bachmann's support for the Tea Party as "radical." Conservative sites are upset, saying the cover makes Bachmann look crazy and accusing Newsweek of bias against conservatives. They also mention past controversial covers, like Mitt Romney as a Mormon musical star and the Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The question is whether the cover crosses a line.

I should start the summary by introducing the cover and the controversy. Mention the headline and that "rage" isn't in the article. Then talk about the criticism from conservatives, their accusations, and the comparison to past covers. End with the question posed by the article.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it concisely, making sure each key point is included without going into too much detail. Also, remember to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.
