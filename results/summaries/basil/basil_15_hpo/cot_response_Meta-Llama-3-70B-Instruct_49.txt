SUMMARY:
Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE", which has sparked outrage among conservatives. The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have led some to claim it makes her look "crazy". The accompanying article, written by Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. Conservative websites are crying foul, accusing the mainstream media of being "biased" against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous controversial issues featuring Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, the latter being deemed "infamous". The question remains: does the Bachmann cover cross a line? END OF SUMMARY.
