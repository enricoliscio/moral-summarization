SUMMARY: Newsweek stirs up controversy with a cover featuring Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The cover, which portrays Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, has drawn criticism from conservative websites, who claim it makes her look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin in a negative light. The magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as "rageful" and "crazy" crosses a moral line by intentionally misrepresenting and demeaning a public figure to stir up controversy and boost sales, perpetuating a harmful narrative that women in power are unstable and irrational. The use of such tactics undermines respectful political discourse and perpetuates gender stereotypes.

END OF SUMMARY.
