SUMMARY: Newsweek once again finds itself in the crosshairs of conservative backlash, this time with its controversial cover featuring Michele Bachmann. The cover, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," depicts Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, a portrayal that has been deemed by some conservative websites as intentionally crazy and biased. While the word "rage" does not appear in the accompanying profile, the article criticizes Bachmann's association with the Tea Party, characterizing it as "radical." This incident echoes similar controversies surrounding Newsweek's previous covers featuring Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, which also drew accusations of media bias against conservatives. The magazine's provocative choice of imagery and wording raises questions about ethical boundaries in journalism and the potential for media outlets to intentionally skew public perception. Is it acceptable for a news publication to use such attention-grabbing tactics, or does it cross a moral line by potentially misleading and inflaming its audience?
END OF SUMMARY.
