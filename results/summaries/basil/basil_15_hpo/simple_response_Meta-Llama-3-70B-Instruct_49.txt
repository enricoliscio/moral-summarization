SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, labeling her "THE QUEEN OF RAGE". The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have sparked outrage among conservative websites, with many claiming it makes her look "crazy". This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney as a star of "The Book of Mormon" and infamously featuring Sarah Palin in 2009. The author of the profile, Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. The cover has raised questions about media bias against conservatives. The moral framing of this issue suggests that the media has a responsibility to represent individuals fairly and without bias, and that sensationalized covers can have a negative impact on public perception.
