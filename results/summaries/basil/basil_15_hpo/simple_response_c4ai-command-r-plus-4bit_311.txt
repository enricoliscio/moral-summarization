SUMMARY: Newsweek stirs controversy with a Michele Bachmann cover, labeling her as "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover draws criticism from conservative websites, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin in a negative light. The magazine's decision to use a provocative headline and image raises ethical questions about media responsibility and bias. By using such a charged word as "rage" and a sensational image, Newsweek is contributing to a divisive political climate and perpetuating negative stereotypes about conservatives. The media has a responsibility to provide balanced and fair coverage, and this cover, along with the previous controversial ones, crosses a line by pandering to bias and sensationalism. 

END OF SUMMARY.
