SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The cover has sparked criticism from conservative websites, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin in a similar light. The word "rage" does not appear in the accompanying profile piece, which criticizes Bachmann's association with the Tea Party. The author of the piece, Lois Romano, describes the Tea Party as "radical." The Bachmann cover has sparked a debate about media bias and the ethical boundaries of news reporting.

END OF SUMMARY.
