SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover with a wide-eyed Michele Bachmann, advertised with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The word "rage" doesn't appear in the actual profile, and conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the portrayal makes Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a less-than-flattering light and facing widespread criticism for its infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The use of "rage" in the headline, despite not appearing in the article, reads as an attempt to stir up controversy and plays into the narrative of conservative bias in the mainstream media. Does this cover cross a line? You decide.
END OF SUMMARY.
