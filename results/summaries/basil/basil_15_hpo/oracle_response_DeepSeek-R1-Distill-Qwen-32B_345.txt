Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally framed words: advertising, reads, biased, and portrayed. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The author, Lois Romano, criticizes the Tea Party as radical but doesn't use the word "rage." Conservatives are upset, calling the cover biased and comparing it to past controversial covers of Romney and Palin.

Now, I need to create a concise summary under 200 words. I should include the morally framed words where appropriate. 

I'll start by mentioning the cover and the headline. Then, note that "rage" isn't in the article but is in the headline. Lois Romano's criticism of the Tea Party as radical is important. Then, mention the conservative backlash, using "biased" and "portrayed." Also, include the examples of Romney and Palin covers to show a pattern.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where it makes sense.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover features Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," sparking controversy. While the article by Lois Romano critiques Bachmann's support for the "radical" Tea Party, the word "rage" does not appear in the story. Conservative critics argue the cover is biased, claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the media of anti-conservative bias. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers, including portrayals of Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin. The争议围绕封面设计是否越界展开讨论。END OF SUMMARY.
