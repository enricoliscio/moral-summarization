Okay, I need to summarize this article about Newsweek's Michele Bachmann cover. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the cover features Bachmann with a "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" headline. The article mentions that "rage" isn't in the actual story, but the author criticizes the Tea Party's radical nature. Conservatives are upset, calling it biased. Newsweek has had similar issues before, like with Romney and Palin. I should include that context to show it's not the first time.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be brief but cover all main points: the cover's description, the headline's impact, the lack of "rage" in the story, the conservative backlash, and previous controversies. Also, the user wants it after "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it to start with the cover and headline, then mention the criticism, the conservative reaction, and the past issues. Make sure it's clear and flows well without being too wordy.

Let me check the word count as I go. Each sentence should add value without redundancy. Maybe combine some points where possible. Also, ensure that the summary captures the essence without getting bogged down in details.

Alright, putting it all together now.
