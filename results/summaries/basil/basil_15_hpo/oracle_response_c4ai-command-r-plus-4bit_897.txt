SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover has stirred up backlash from conservative websites, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accuses the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. The word "rage" doesn't appear in the actual profile of Bachmann, but the author criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann represents. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced conservative backlash for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a less-than-flattering light and facing widespread criticism for its infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The magazine's decision to advertising Bachmann in this way has once again sparked debates about media bias and the portrayal of conservative figures.
END OF SUMMARY.
