SUMMARY:
Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE". The cover has sparked outrage among conservative websites, with many claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy". The article's author, Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced conservative backlash for a cover, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a satirical light and Sarah Palin in an "infamous" cover in 2009. The cover has raised questions about whether the mainstream media is "biased" against conservatives. The debate has sparked a heated discussion about the media's portrayal of conservative politicians. END OF SUMMARY.
