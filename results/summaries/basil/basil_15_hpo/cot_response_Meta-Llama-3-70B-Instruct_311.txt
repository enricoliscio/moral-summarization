SUMMARY:
Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE", which is sparking outrage among conservatives. The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have led some to claim it makes her look "crazy". The article inside, written by Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann champions. Conservative websites are crying foul, accusing Newsweek of being "biased" against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous controversies surrounding Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin. The question remains: does the cover cross a line?
