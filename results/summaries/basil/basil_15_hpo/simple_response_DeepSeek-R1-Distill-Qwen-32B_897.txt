Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about a Newsweek cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover is controversial, and the author, Lois Romano, criticizes the Tea Party as radical. Conservatives are upset, calling the cover biased and making Bachmann look crazy. Newsweek has had similar issues before, like with Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney covers.

I need to capture the controversy, the criticism from conservatives, and the context of Newsweek's past covers. Also, the moral framing is about media bias and how the cover might be unfair or sensationalist.

I'll start by mentioning the cover and the headline, then note that "rage" isn't in the article. Lois Romano's criticism of the Tea Party is important. Then, the conservative backlash and examples of past covers. Finally, the question of whether it crosses a line.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspect is clear. I'll structure it to flow from the cover's introduction to the reactions and past context, ending with the question of bias.
