SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue has sparked controversy with its cover featuring Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have drawn criticism from conservative websites, with some claiming it makes her look "crazy." The article's author, Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash from conservatives, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a Broadway show and Sarah Palin in a controversial cover in 2009. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the media's bias against conservatives is a pressing concern. The use of the word "rage" to describe Bachmann's politics implies a negative and emotional tone, rather than a thoughtful and rational approach. This perceived bias raises questions about the media's responsibility to present fair and balanced reporting.
