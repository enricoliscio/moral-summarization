SUMMARY:
Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover with Michele Bachmann, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover has sparked outrage among conservatives, who accuse the magazine of biased and unfair portrayal of Bachmann and the Tea Party. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, as it previously drew criticism for its infamous portrayal of Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin. The magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as "crazy" and "rageful" has sparked moral outrage, with some questioning the media's bias against conservatives. The use of "rage" in the headline, despite not appearing in the article, and the wide-eyed expression captured in the photograph, have been criticized for their negative and controversial implications. The incident has once again brought to light the ethical dilemma of the media's role in political discourse and the boundaries of acceptable bias.
