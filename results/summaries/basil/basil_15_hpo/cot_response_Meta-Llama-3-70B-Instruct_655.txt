SUMMARY:
Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover has sparked outrage among conservative websites, with many claiming it portrays Bachmann as "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being "biased" against conservatives. The article inside, written by Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann champions. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced conservative backlash for a cover, with previous examples including a portrayal of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The question remains whether the cover crosses a line, but one thing is certain - it has stirred up controversy and outrage. END OF SUMMARY.
