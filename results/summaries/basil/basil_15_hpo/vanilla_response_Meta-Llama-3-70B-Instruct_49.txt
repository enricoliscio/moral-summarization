SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, labeling her as "THE QUEEN OF RAGE". The cover photo shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background. Conservative websites have already criticized the cover, claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous controversies surrounding Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin. The article inside the magazine, written by Lois Romano, criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann supports. The cover has sparked debate, with some questioning whether it crosses a line.
