SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann is sparking controversy among conservatives. The cover, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," depicts Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background. While the word "rage" does not appear in the accompanying profile, which criticizes Bachmann's association with the Tea Party, conservative websites have criticized the cover for allegedly making Bachmann look "crazy" and biased against conservatives. This incident echoes previous controversies involving Newsweek covers, such as the Mitt Romney cover comparing him to "The Book of Mormon" musical and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The Bachmann cover has sparked debates about media bias and the ethical boundaries of magazine covers.
