Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the author's tone and the specific moral terms used.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The key points are about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The article mentions that the word "rage" isn't in the actual profile but is used in the cover. Lois Romano criticizes Bachmann's Tea Party stance as radical. Conservatives are upset, calling the cover biased and making Bachmann look crazy. There are references to past controversial covers of Romney and Palin, which adds context about Newsweek's history.

Now, the user wants the summary to include the morally framed words: advertising, reads, biased, portrayed. I need to make sure these words are included. I'll structure the summary to highlight the controversy, the use of "rage" in the cover despite not being in the article, the criticism from conservatives, and the comparison to past covers. 

I should start by stating the cover's impact, then mention the headline and its absence in the content. Next, address the conservative backlash and the accusation of bias. Finally, tie it to previous controversial covers to show a pattern. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring it flows naturally while preserving the moral elements.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is intact.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover features Michele Bachmann under the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," sparking controversy. The cover advertising uses the word "rage," though it doesn't appear in the actual profile by Lois Romano, which criticizes Bachmann's association with the "radical" Tea Party. Conservative websites have accused the magazine of bias, with some claiming the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy." This isn't the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers; previous issues included portrayals of Mitt Romney as a character from "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous 2009 Sarah Palin cover. Critics argue that such covers cross a line, reflecting a perceived bias against conservatives. END OF SUMMARY.
