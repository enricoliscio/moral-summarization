SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann is sparking controversy, with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" advertising a profile that criticizes the "radical" nature of the Tea Party. Conservative websites are crying foul, claiming the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the mainstream media of being biased against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous examples including a portrayal of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The Bachmann cover is being criticized for its sensationalized headline, with some arguing it crosses a line. The author of the profile, Lois Romano, does not use the word "rage" in the actual article, leading some to question the magazine's motives behind the provocative cover.
