Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Newsweek's Michele Bachmann cover. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Newsweek's latest issue featuring a cover of Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover shows her with a wide-eyed expression against a blue background. It mentions that the word "rage" isn't actually in the article written by Lois Romano, but she does criticize Bachmann's support for the Tea Party as radical. Conservative sites are upset, saying it makes Bachmann look crazy and accuses Newsweek of bias against conservatives. They also mention past controversial covers, like Mitt Romney as a star of "The Book of Mormon" and the 2009 Sarah Palin cover. The article ends by asking if the cover crosses a line.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the cover image, the headline, the absence of "rage" in the article, the criticism from conservatives, the comparison to past covers, and the question about bias.

I'll start by introducing the cover and headline. Then explain that "rage" isn't in the article but the profile is critical. Mention the conservative backlash, the comparison to past covers, and end with the question about bias.

I should make sure the summary is concise and flows well, hitting all the main points without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step.

First sentence: Newsweek's latest cover features Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." 

Next: The article by Lois Romano doesn't use "rage" but criticizes Bachmann's Tea Party support as radical.

Then: Conservatives are upset, saying the cover makes her look crazy and accusing bias.

Finally: Reference past controversial covers and the question of whether the cover crosses a line.

Putting it all together, making sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.
