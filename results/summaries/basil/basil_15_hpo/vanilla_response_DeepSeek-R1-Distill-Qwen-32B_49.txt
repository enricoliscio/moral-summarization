Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann. The cover has her with a wide-eyed expression against a blue background and the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The author, Lois Romano, doesn't use the word "rage" in the actual profile but criticizes the Tea Party as radical. Conservatives are upset, calling the cover biased and making Bachmann look crazy. There's mention of past controversial covers, like Mitt Romney as a Broadway star and the 2009 Sarah Palin cover. The article ends by asking if the cover crosses a line.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the cover description, the headline, the author's stance, the conservative reaction, and the historical context of Newsweek's controversial covers. I'll make sure to mention that "rage" isn't in the article but is in the headline. Also, highlight the conservative backlash and examples of previous covers. Keep it concise and clear.

Let me structure it: Start with the cover and headline, then the content of the article, the conservative criticism, and the history of Newsweek's controversial covers. End with the question about crossing a line.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward. Make sure it's under 200 words. Let me count the words as I draft to ensure compliance.

Alright, I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together.
