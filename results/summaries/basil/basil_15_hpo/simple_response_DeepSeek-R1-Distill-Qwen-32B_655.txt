Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover is causing controversy, especially among conservatives. The author, Lois Romano, criticizes Bachmann's support for the Tea Party's radical nature, but the word "rage" isn't in the article. Conservative websites are upset, calling the cover biased and making Bachmann look crazy. Newsweek has had similar issues before with covers of Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing. The author seems to present both sides: the criticism from conservatives and the context of Newsweek's past controversial covers. I should highlight the controversy, the reaction from conservatives, and the comparison to previous covers to show the pattern.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and balanced. I'll start by mentioning the cover and the headline, then note the absence of "rage" in the article. Next, I'll explain the conservative backlash and their perception of bias. Finally, I'll add the context of Newsweek's history with controversial covers to show it's not an isolated incident.

Let me structure it step by step to ensure all points are covered without being too lengthy. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, maintaining the moral perspective by showing both the criticism and the context.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" has sparked controversy, particularly among conservatives. The cover, which shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression against a stark blue background, has been criticized for making her appear "crazy." Conservative websites argue that the magazine is biased against conservatives, with one blogger questioning the media's impartiality. However, the word "rage" does not appear in the actual article, which instead critiques Bachmann's support for the Tea Party's "radical" nature. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers; past controversial issues include portrayals of Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin. The cover has reignited debates about media bias and whether such imagery crosses a line. END OF SUMMARY.
