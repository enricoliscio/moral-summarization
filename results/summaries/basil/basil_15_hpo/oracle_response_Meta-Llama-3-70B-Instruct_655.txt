SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue features a controversial cover of Michele Bachmann, dubbed "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," which is already drawing criticism from conservative websites. The cover's stark blue background and Bachmann's wide-eyed expression have sparked accusations that the magazine is biased against conservatives. The article's author, Lois Romano, does criticize the "radical" nature of the Tea Party, which Bachmann champions. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover, with previous examples including a portrayal of Mitt Romney as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and an infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The magazine's advertising of the story with the "rage" headline has been met with outrage, with some asking if the mainstream media can be considered unbiased against conservatives. The cover's intention is clear: to sway public opinion and perpetuate a negative image of Bachmann.
