SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover featuring Michele Bachmann is drawing criticism from conservative websites. The cover, titled "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," depicts Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, and the word "rage" has been criticized for not appearing in the accompanying profile piece. This incident recalls similar controversies involving Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin. Conservative critics argue that the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accuses the media of bias against conservatives.

END OF SUMMARY.
