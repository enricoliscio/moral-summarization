SUMMARY:

Newsweek's latest issue has sparked controversy with a Michele Bachmann cover that critics claim is biased against conservatives. The cover features Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, accompanied by the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," a phrase not found in the actual profile. Conservative websites are crying foul, saying the image makes Bachmann look "crazy." This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for a cover; previous examples include a Mitt Romney cover that portrayed him as a star of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon" and the infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The magazine's advertising tactics are being called into question, with some asking if the mainstream media is biased against conservatives. The cover's intention is clear: to sway public opinion and portray Bachmann in a certain light. The question remains, does it cross a line?
