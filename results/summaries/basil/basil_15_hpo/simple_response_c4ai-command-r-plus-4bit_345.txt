SUMMARY: Newsweek stirs up controversy with a provocative cover of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbing her "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The cover draws criticism from conservative websites, who claim it unfairly portrays Bachmann in a negative light and is evidence of media bias against conservatives. This incident adds to a history of controversial Newsweek covers featuring conservative figures, such as Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, raising questions about the ethical boundaries of journalistic expression and the potential impact on public perception. Is it acceptable for news media to use such attention-grabbing tactics, or does it cross a moral line by veering into biased territory and potentially influencing readers' opinions unfairly? The debate rages on as media outlets walk a fine line between attracting readers and maintaining ethical integrity in their coverage.
END OF SUMMARY.
