SUMMARY:
The latest issue of Newsweek is stirring up *controversy* with its cover featuring Michele Bachmann. The cover, which depicts Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression and the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," has sparked *backlash* from conservative websites, who are *crying foul* over the portrayal, claiming it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and accusing the media of being *biased* against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced conservative *criticism* for its cover choices, having previously portrayed Mitt Romney in a less-than-flattering light and facing an *infamous* controversy over a Sarah Palin cover in 2009. The magazine's portrayal of Bachmann has sparked a debate about the media's treatment of conservative figures and the ethical boundaries of journalistic expression.
