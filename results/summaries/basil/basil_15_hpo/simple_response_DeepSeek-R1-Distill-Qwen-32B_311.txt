Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE." The article mentions that the word "rage" isn't in the actual profile but the author criticizes the Tea Party's radical nature. Conservatives are upset, calling it biased. There's also mention of past controversial covers of Romney and Palin.

Hmm, I need to make sure the summary captures the controversy and the moral aspects. The user emphasized preserving the author's moral framing, so I should highlight the criticism from conservatives about bias and how the cover might be seen as unfair. Also, the comparison to past covers shows a pattern, which adds to the moral argument about media bias.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the cover and the headline, then note that "rage" isn't in the article. Then discuss the conservative backlash, the blogger's quote about bias, and the previous controversial covers. Conclude by asking if it crosses a line, as in the original.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the cover, explain the controversy, mention the criticism, reference past issues, and end with the question. Make sure to keep the tone neutral but include the moral critique from conservatives.

Wait, should I mention that the article itself doesn't use "rage"? Yes, that's important because it shows the headline is more provocative than the content. Also, emphasizing the conservatives' perception of bias is key to the moral framing.

I think that's all. Time to put it together succinctly.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover features Michele Bachmann with the headline "THE QUEEN OF RAGE," sparking controversy despite the word "rage" not appearing in the accompanying article. Author Lois Romano criticizes Bachmann's support for the "radical" Tea Party movement, but conservatives argue the cover is biased, claiming it portrays Bachmann as "crazy." Critics, including conservative bloggers, accuse the mainstream media of anti-conservative bias, pointing to Newsweek's history of controversial covers, such as its portrayal of Mitt Romney as a character from "The Book of Mormon" and its infamous 2009 Sarah Palin cover. The cover has reignited debates about media bias and whether such imagery crosses a line in political journalism. END OF SUMMARY.
