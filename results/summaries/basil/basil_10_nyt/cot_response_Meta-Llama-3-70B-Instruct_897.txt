SUMMARY:
The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor, a move meant to set a tone of constitutional authority and importance. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans battled over the language and procedure of the reading. The decision to omit superseded portions, including references to slaves, was met with inquiry and debate. Despite the partisan tone, the reading proceeded, with members from diverse districts and backgrounds taking turns to read the document aloud. The event was seen as a nod to the Tea Party and a message to voters about the importance of the Constitution. The reading was also meant to instruct members, who must now cite the constitutional source of their bills. The contentious process of repealing the health care law, deemed unconstitutional by Republicans, began on the same day. END OF SUMMARY.
