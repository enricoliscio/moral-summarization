SUMMARY:
The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor, a move meant to set a tone of constitutional adherence. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans clashed over the reading's procedure, with Democrats questioning what parts of the Constitution would be omitted. The reading, which excluded superseded portions, was seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement, which emphasizes the Constitution's role in limiting federal powers. The event was also meant to instruct members and inform voters about the Constitution's importance. Despite some partisan battles, the reading proceeded, with members from diverse backgrounds reading the document aloud. The event marked a rare occasion, with the Office of the Historian unable to find any prior instances of the full Constitution being read aloud on the House floor. END OF SUMMARY.
