SUMMARY: On Thursday morning, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. The reading was meant to instruct members on the constitutional source of their authority for every bill they propose and to inform voters about the importance of the document. The idea was proposed by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who wanted to send a message to voters about the significance of the Constitution. The reading was also a nod to the Tea Party, a political movement that often cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The order of reading was decided in advance, with any superseded portions of the Constitution, including amendments, being omitted. The reading was interrupted by a protester, who was removed from the chamber. According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, this was the first time the full text of the Constitution was read aloud on the House Floor, although there have been two prior instances of the text being inserted into the Congressional Record. The act serves as a reminder of the importance of the Constitution in the legislative process and the rights and responsibilities of Congress.
