SUMMARY:

In a historic move, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. However, the proceedings were marred by partisan bickering, with Democrats questioning the decision to omit certain portions of the document, including references to slaves and prohibition. Despite the initial hiccups, the reading continued, with members from both parties participating. The exercise was meant to instruct members, inform voters, and send a message about the importance of the Constitution. It was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the document as the basis for its political theory. The reading was a first in the House's history, with the goal of ensuring party parity and allowing all interested members to participate. As the document was read, a protester was removed from the chamber, highlighting the ongoing tensions. The event marked a significant moment in the new Congress, with the Constitution taking center stage.
