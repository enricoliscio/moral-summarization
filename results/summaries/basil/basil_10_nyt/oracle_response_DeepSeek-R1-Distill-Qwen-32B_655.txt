Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used the words "remove" and "making" as morally framed words, so I should make sure to include those.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The 112th Congress started by reading the Constitution aloud, with some initial conflicts. Democrats were concerned about which parts would be read, especially the parts about slavery and prohibition. The Republicans wanted to skip amendments to avoid mentioning those controversial sections. This led to a heated debate, which might indicate future partisan fights over the Constitution's meaning.

The reading began with the preamble, then proceeded through the articles. It was a symbolic act, part of new rules requiring bills to cite constitutional authority. Rep. Goodlatte mentioned it was to educate members and voters, especially in response to the Tea Party's focus on limited government. They also started the process of repealing the healthcare law, which they argue isn't constitutional.

I should highlight the moral implications, like the "removal" of certain parts and the "making" of a statement to the public. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include those key terms.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the event, mention the initial conflict, the parts removed, the symbolic reading, the educational purpose, and the political message to the Tea Party. Also, note the historical context of previous readings. Make sure to use "remove" and "making" appropriately.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the morally framed words.

SUMMARY:  
The 112th Congress began by reading the U.S. Constitution aloud, a symbolic act aimed at educating members and voters about constitutional authority. The reading, part of new rules requiring bills to cite constitutional sources, was marred by initial conflict. Democrats questioned which parts of the Constitution would be read, particularly those superseded by amendments, such as references to slavery and prohibition. Republicans decided to skip these sections, preventing awkward references. The debate over language foreshadowed potential future partisan disputes. The reading proceeded, with leaders like Boehner, Pelosi, and Cantor taking turns. The act was seen as a nod to the Tea Party, emphasizing constitutional limits on federal power. It also coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. The event, the first of its kind in modern history, was designed to "remove" confusion and "make" a clear statement about the Constitution's importance. END OF SUMMARY.
