SUMMARY:

The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor, a first in the chamber's history. The reading was part of the new rules package, aiming to instruct members and inform voters about the Constitution's importance. Republicans decided to read only the current version of the Constitution, excluding superseded portions and amendments. Democrats questioned the process, leading to a brief partisan battle. The reading was done sentence by sentence, with members from diverse backgrounds participating. The event served as a nod to the Tea Party, which emphasizes the Constitution's role in limiting federal powers. The reading coincided with the start of the repeal process of the healthcare law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. This event marks a new approach to highlighting the Constitution's significance in shaping legislative decisions.
