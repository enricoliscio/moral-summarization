SUMMARY: In a bid to set the tone for the 112th Congress and honor the wishes of the Tea Party, House Republicans decided to read aloud the US Constitution in the chamber. This was meant to serve as a reminder to members and voters alike that the Constitution is the source of Congress's authority and that any bills passed must be grounded in it. The reading, which was interrupted briefly by a protester, was also intended to signal the start of Republicans' contentious efforts to repeal the health care law, which they believe lacks a constitutional basis. The move has sparked debate over the meaning and application of the Constitution, with Democrats and Republicans disagreeing on the language and interpretation of the document. While the Constitution has been appended to the Congressional Record twice before, this was the first time it had been read aloud in its entirety on the House Floor. The event highlighted the importance of the Constitution in shaping US politics and the ongoing struggle to balance federal powers with individual rights. END OF SUMMARY.
