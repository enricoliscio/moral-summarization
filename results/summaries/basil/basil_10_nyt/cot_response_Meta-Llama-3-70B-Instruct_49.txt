SUMMARY:
In a historic move, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. The reading was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans battled over the issue of language, particularly regarding the omission of superseded portions. The event was meant to instruct members, who must now cite the constitutional source of their authority, and to inform voters. Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, who came up with the idea, emphasized the importance of sending a message to the people that the Constitution is an important document. The reading was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for their political theory. The event was marked by a protester being removed from the chamber, highlighting the contentious nature of the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
