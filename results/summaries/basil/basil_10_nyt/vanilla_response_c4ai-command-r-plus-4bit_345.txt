SUMMARY: Members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the House floor on Thursday, setting the tone for the 112th Congress, in which every House bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading was meant to instruct members on the Constitution, which now underlies their bills, and to send a message to voters about the importance of the document. The idea was proposed by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, who wanted to emphasize the federal government's limited powers as outlined in the Constitution. The reading also served as a nod to the Tea Party movement, which has long cited the Constitution as a basis for its political theory. The event was marked by partisan battles, with Democrats and Republicans disagreeing over the language and interpretation of the Constitution. The reading was interrupted by a protester, who was removed from the chamber. This is believed to be the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House floor, although there have been two prior instances of the text being inserted into the Congressional Record.
