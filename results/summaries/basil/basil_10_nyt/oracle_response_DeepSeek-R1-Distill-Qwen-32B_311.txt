Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specifically mentioned that the summary should include the morally framed words "remove" and "making." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The 112th Congress started by reading the Constitution aloud, with some initial conflicts between Democrats and Republicans. They decided to skip parts superseded by amendments to avoid mentioning slavery and prohibition. The reading was part of new rules requiring bills to cite constitutional authority, which was a nod to the Tea Party. It was also meant to inform voters and set a tone for the Congress.

I need to ensure that the summary includes the words "remove" and "making." I'll structure the summary to highlight the decision to remove certain parts and the making of the reading process. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone by emphasizing the symbolic nature and the underlying political motives.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the required words and maintain the moral framing as per the article.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began by reading the U.S. Constitution aloud, a symbolic act aimed at setting a tone of constitutional adherence. Before the reading, Democrats and Republicans clashed over procedural details, with Democrats questioning which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. It was agreed to remove sections superseded by amendments, avoiding references to slavery and prohibition. The reading, initiated by Speaker John Boehner, included contributions from members of both parties, with a focus on ensuring party parity. Representative Robert Goodlatte, the architect of the plan, emphasized its purpose: to instruct members on constitutional authority for their bills and inform voters, particularly as Congress sought to repeal the health care law, which critics argued lacked constitutional basis. The event was seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement, which emphasizes constitutional limits on federal power. This marked the first time the full Constitution was read aloud on the House floor, symbolizing a renewed focus on constitutional principles. END OF SUMMARY.
