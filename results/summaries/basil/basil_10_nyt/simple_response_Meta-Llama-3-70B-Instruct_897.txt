SUMMARY:

In a symbolic move, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on Thursday, with every House bill now required to cite its constitutional source of authority. The reading was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. Republicans pushed back, and the debate presaged future partisan battles over the document's meaning and application. The reading served multiple purposes, including instructing members and informing voters, but was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The event was a first in House history, with members from diverse backgrounds reading the document aloud, sentence by sentence. Despite some disruptions, the reading sent a message about the importance of the Constitution and its role in guiding congressional actions.
