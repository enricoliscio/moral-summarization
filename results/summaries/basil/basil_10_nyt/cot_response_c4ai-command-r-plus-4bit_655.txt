SUMMARY: In an effort to instruct lawmakers and inform voters on the importance of the Constitution, members of the House of Representatives began reading the document aloud on the chamber's floor. The reading served multiple purposes, including sending a message to constituents that the Constitution is an important document. It also acted as a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is based on the Constitution. The act of reading the Constitution aloud in the House is a contested practice, with Democrats and Republicans disagreeing on the language and interpretation of the document. Despite this, the reading proceeded, with Speaker John Boehner reading the preamble and Representative Nancy Pelosi reading Article 1, Section 1. The event highlighted the moral framing of the Constitution as the foundation of US law and governance, with lawmakers yielding to read and underlie their bills with its authority.
