SUMMARY: On Thursday morning, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. The reading was interrupted by a debate between Democrats and Republicans over which parts of the Constitution would be read and which would be omitted. Once the order of reading was settled, Speaker John Boehner read the preamble, followed by Representative Nancy Pelosi, who read Article 1, Section 1. Other members who wished to read were recognized from their seats. The reading was meant to instruct members on the Constitution, which must now be cited in every House bill, and to send a message to voters about the importance of the document. It also served as a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is based on the Constitution. The reading of the Constitution on the House Floor is believed to be a rare occurrence, with only two prior instances found in the Congressional Record.
