SUMMARY: Setting a moral tone for the 112th Congress, House members embarked on reading the US Constitution aloud, an act meant to instruct and inform. Despite initial partisan bickering over language and procedure, the reading proceeded, with lawmakers taking turns reciting the document's sections. The event aimed to underscore the Constitution as the foundation for legislation and to appease the Tea Party, critical of federal power expansion. The removal of superseded portions, including references to slaves, and the omission of amendments, however, sparked debates over the document's interpretation. Representative Robert Goodlatte, who proposed the reading, acknowledged the significance of the Constitution and the need to send a message to constituents. This unprecedented act in the House's history underscores a commitment to constitutional principles and the rights and responsibilities of Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
