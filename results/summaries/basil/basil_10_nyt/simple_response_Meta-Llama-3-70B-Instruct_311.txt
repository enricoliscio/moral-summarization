SUMMARY:

In a symbolic gesture, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. The reading was part of the new rules package, aimed at instructing members and informing voters about the Constitution's importance. The event was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. However, the proceedings were not without controversy, as Democrats questioned the selection of constitutional passages to be read and the parliamentary procedure. The reading was eventually completed, with members from both parties participating. The event marked a rare occasion, as it was the first time the full text of the Constitution was read aloud on the House Floor.

The moral framing of this event is one of accountability and respect for the Constitution. By reading the document aloud, lawmakers are acknowledging the importance of adhering to the Constitution and recognizing its authority. The controversy surrounding the event also highlights the importance of transparency and fairness in the political process.
