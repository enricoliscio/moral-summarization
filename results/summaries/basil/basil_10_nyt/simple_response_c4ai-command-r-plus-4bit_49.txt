SUMMARY: On Thursday morning, members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. This act served as a nod to the Tea Party and its supporters, who often cite the Constitution as the basis for their political beliefs. The reading was also meant to instruct members on the importance of the Constitution in crafting legislation and to send a message to voters back home about the significance of the document. 

Before the reading commenced, there was debate between Democrats and Republicans over which parts of the Constitution would be read and which would be omitted. Ultimately, any portion superseded by amendments, including references to slaves and prohibition, was not read aloud. 

The reading of the Constitution in its entirety on the House Floor is believed to be a first in history, according to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives. This act symbolically emphasizes the commitment to upholding the Constitution and marks a shift towards a more rigorous interpretation of federal powers and congressional responsibilities. 

END OF SUMMARY.
