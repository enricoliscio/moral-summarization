SUMMARY: On Thursday, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. This act was part of the new rules package, intended to instruct members on the constitutional basis for their bills and to inform voters. The reading was also a nod to the Tea Party, a political movement that strongly emphasizes the Constitution. The event was marked by initial partisan battles over language and procedure, with Democrats questioning which parts of the Constitution would be read and why. The reading eventually proceeded, with leaders of both parties participating, followed by other members who wished to read. The reading was briefly interrupted by a protester, who was removed from the chamber. This is believed to be the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House Floor, although there have been two prior instances of the text being inserted into the Congressional Record. The event underscores the importance of the Constitution in shaping the legislative agenda and engaging citizens in the democratic process. END OF SUMMARY.
