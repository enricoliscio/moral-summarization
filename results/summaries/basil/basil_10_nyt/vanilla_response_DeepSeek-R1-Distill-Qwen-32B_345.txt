Okay, I need to summarize this article about the 112th Congress starting the reading of the Constitution. Let me read through the article carefully. 

First, the key points are that the House began reading the Constitution aloud, it's part of new rules requiring every bill to cite its constitutional authority. There were some initial disagreements about what parts to read, especially regarding amendments and controversial sections like the three-fifths clause. The reading started with the preamble, then moved through the articles, with various members taking turns. There was a protest during the reading. The purpose was to educate members and the public, and it was seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement. This was the first time the Constitution was read aloud in the House since 1882 and 1915, but those were just insertions into the record, not actual readings.

I should structure the summary to include the main events: the start of the reading, the initial debate, who read which parts, the protest, the reasons behind the reading, and the historical context. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I should also mention the political significance, especially the Tea Party connection and the repeal of the healthcare law.

Let me make sure I cover all these points without going into too much detail. I'll start by stating the event, then the debate, the reading process, the protest, the reasons, the historical context, and the political implications. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear and concise summary.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began the tradition of reading the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives, a move tied to new rules requiring all bills to cite constitutional authority. The reading, initiated by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, aimed to educate members and the public about constitutional limits. Initially, there was debate over which parts to read, particularly avoiding controversial sections like the three-fifths clause. The preamble was read by Speaker John Boehner, followed by Nancy Pelosi and others. A protest occurred during the session. The event, the first full reading on the House floor in over a century, was seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement and its focus on constitutional principles. It also coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. END OF SUMMARY.
