Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. So, first, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the underlying tone.

The article talks about the 112th Congress starting the reading of the U.S. Constitution. It mentions the initial disagreements between Democrats and Republicans, especially regarding which parts to read. The fact that they excluded parts related to slavery and prohibition shows a sensitivity to historical issues. The reading was meant to instruct members on constitutional authority and inform the public, especially appealing to the Tea Party movement.

I should highlight the procedural battles, the symbolic nature of the event, and its connection to the Tea Party. Also, noting the historical context, like previous readings in 1882 and 1915, adds depth. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on key events and the underlying motivations without getting too detailed.

I'll structure the summary to start with the event, mention the disagreements, the purpose behind the reading, its political significance, and the historical precedent. This way, I preserve the moral and political framing the author intended.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began its session with a symbolic reading of the U.S. Constitution on the House floor, a move aimed at setting a tone of constitutional adherence. The process was marred by initial disagreements between Democrats and Republicans over which parts of the Constitution to include, particularly avoiding references to slavery and prohibition. The reading, spearheaded by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, was intended to educate members and constituents about the limits of federal power, a message aligned with the Tea Party movement's emphasis on constitutional governance. The event also coincided with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans argued was unconstitutional. Despite the procedural battles, the reading highlighted the document's enduring relevance, with participants from diverse backgrounds reflecting the nation's evolution. This marked the first time the Constitution was read aloud in the House since 1915. END OF SUMMARY.
