SUMMARY:

The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor. The reading was part of the new rules package, which requires every House bill to cite its constitutional authority. The reading was done sentence by sentence, with members from both parties participating. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. The decision was made to skip sections superseded by amendments, including references to slavery and prohibition. The reading served as a nod to the Tea Party and aimed to instruct members and inform voters about the Constitution's importance. This is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House floor, with previous instances only inserting the text into the Congressional Record. The event was seen as a precursor to future partisan battles over the Constitution's meaning and application.
