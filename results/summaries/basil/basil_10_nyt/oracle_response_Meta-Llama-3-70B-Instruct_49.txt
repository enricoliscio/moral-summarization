SUMMARY:

In a historic moment, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. However, the event was marred by partisan battles over language and procedure, with Democrats questioning the decision to exclude certain portions of the Constitution. The reading was part of the new rules package, aimed at instructing members and informing voters about the Constitution's importance. The event was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. Despite the tensions, members from both parties took turns reading the document, with the goal of promoting party parity. The sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester, highlighting the challenges that lay ahead. The reading serves as a reminder of the Constitution's significance and the need for lawmakers to adhere to its principles. By making this gesture, the House is sending a message to the people that the Constitution is an important document that should guide their actions. END OF SUMMARY.
