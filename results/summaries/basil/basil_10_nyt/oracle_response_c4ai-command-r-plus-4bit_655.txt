SUMMARY: On Thursday morning, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. This act was meant to instruct members on the constitutional basis of their legislation and to emphasize the importance of the document to voters, particularly those aligned with the Tea Party movement. The reading was interrupted by a protester, who had to be removed from the chamber. 

The decision to omit superseded portions of the Constitution, including references to slaves and prohibition, sparked partisan debate before the reading commenced. Despite this, the reading proceeded with each member reading a sentence, reflecting the diversity of accents and backgrounds not represented when the document was first written. 

According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, this is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House Floor, although there have been two prior instances of the full or partial text being inserted into the Congressional Record. The event underscores the ongoing debate about federal powers and the role of Congress in shaping legislation that aligns with the Constitution. 

END OF SUMMARY.
