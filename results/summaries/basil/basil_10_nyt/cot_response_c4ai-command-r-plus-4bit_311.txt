SUMMARY:
In an act of moral instruction and information, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber floor. This act, part of the new rules package, was met with initial partisan battles over language and procedure, with Democrats and Republicans sparring over the meaning and application of the document. The reading was meant to send a message to voters about the importance of the Constitution, especially in light of recent debates about the expansion of federal government powers. It also served as a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is grounded in the Constitution. Despite the contentious start, the reading proceeded with party parity, allowing all interested members to participate. The act was a historic one, with no record of a similar event in the past, and it underscored the commitment to ensuring that all future bills have a constitutional basis.
