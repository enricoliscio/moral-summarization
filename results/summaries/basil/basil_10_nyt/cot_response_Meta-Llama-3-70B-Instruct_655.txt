SUMMARY:
The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor, a move meant to instruct members and inform voters. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans clashed over parliamentary procedure, presaging future partisan battles over the document's meaning and application. The reading was a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. Despite the contentious atmosphere, the event served as a reminder of the Constitution's importance, with Representative Robert W. Goodlatte stating that it's essential to send a message to people that the Constitution is an important document. The reading was a first in the House's history, and its significance was not lost on the lawmakers who participated. END OF SUMMARY.
