SUMMARY:

In a historic move, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on Thursday morning, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. However, the proceedings were marred by partisan battles over language and procedure. Democrats, led by Jay Inslee, questioned the decision to omit certain parts of the Constitution, including references to slaves and prohibition. The Republicans, led by John Boehner, insisted on pushing forward with the reading, which was meant to instruct members and inform voters about the importance of the Constitution. The event was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. Despite the initial hiccups, the reading continued, with members from both parties taking turns to read the document. The sergeant-at-arms had to be called to remove a protester from the chamber. The event marks a rare occasion, with the Office of the Historian unable to find any previous instances of the full text of the Constitution being read aloud on the House Floor. END OF SUMMARY.
