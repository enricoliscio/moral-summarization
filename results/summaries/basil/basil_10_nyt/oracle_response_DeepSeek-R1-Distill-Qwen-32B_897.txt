Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US House reading the Constitution, and the author used words like "remove" and "making." I need to make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the 112th Congress starting with reading the Constitution, some initial conflicts between Democrats and Republicans, and the purpose behind the reading, especially relating to the Tea Party and repealing healthcare.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the morally framed words. I should mention the "remove" of parts related to slavery and prohibition, and the "making" of the document. Also, highlight the partisan battles and the symbolic nod to the Tea Party.

I'll structure the summary to cover the event, the initial conflict, the purpose, and the historical context. Make sure it's concise but includes all key points and the moral language specified.

SUMMARY:  
The 112th Congress began by reading the U.S. Constitution aloud, a symbolic act aimed at setting a tone of constitutional fidelity. The process was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned the rules for the reading, including which parts would be included or removed, particularly those referencing slavery or prohibition. This early conflict foreshadowed potential partisan battles over the document's interpretation. The reading proceeded, with lawmakers from both parties taking turns, including Representative Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner. The event was designed to instruct members on constitutional authority and inform the public, while also serving as a nod to the Tea Party movement, which emphasizes limited federal power. The reading coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. The act was a rare public display of the Constitution, with only two prior instances in Congressional history. The process aimed to make the document's principles more accessible, though its execution highlighted ongoing debates over its meaning and application. END OF SUMMARY.
