SUMMARY:

In a symbolic gesture, the House of Representatives began the 112th Congress by reading the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor. The reading was a nod to the Tea Party movement, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned the procedure and the decision to omit sections that were superseded by amendments, including references to slavery. The reading was meant to instruct members and inform voters, emphasizing the importance of the Constitution in guiding legislative actions. The event also coincided with the start of the process to repeal the health care law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. The reading was a historic moment, with the Office of the Historian unable to find any previous instances of the full text of the Constitution being read aloud on the House Floor.
