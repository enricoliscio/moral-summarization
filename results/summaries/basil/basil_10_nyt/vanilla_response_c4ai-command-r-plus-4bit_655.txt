SUMMARY: On Thursday, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress, in which every House bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading was meant to instruct members on the Constitution, which now underlies their bills, and to inform voters. It also served as a nod to the Tea Party, a political movement that cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans battled over the language and parliamentary procedure before the reading began. The reading was interrupted by a protester, who was removed from the chamber. According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, this is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House Floor. The reading was part of the new rules package and was suggested by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, who wanted to send a message to voters about the importance of the Constitution.
