SUMMARY: With the 112th Congress requiring every House bill to cite its constitutional source of authority, members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber floor. The reading was meant to instruct members on the Constitution, which now underlies their bills, and to emphasize to voters the importance of the document as the foundation of federal powers and the limits thereof. The reading was also a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is based on the Constitution. The event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans initially battled over which parts of the Constitution would be read and which would be omitted, reflecting their differing interpretations of the document. The reading proceeded after these issues were settled, with Speaker John Boehner reading the preamble and Representative Nancy Pelosi reading Article 1, Section 1. The act of reading the Constitution aloud on the House floor is a rare occurrence and serves as a reminder of the moral and legal foundations of American democracy.
