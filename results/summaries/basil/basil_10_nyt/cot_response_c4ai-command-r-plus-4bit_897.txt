SUMMARY:
In an unprecedented move, members of the House of Representatives read the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting a moral and instructive tone for the 112th Congress. This act served as a message to voters, highlighting the importance of the Constitution in the legislative process and instructing members to cite the constitutional source of authority for every bill. The reading was meant to inform and instruct, sending a message about the significance of the Constitution, especially in light of contested debates over federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress. The event also paid homage to the Tea Party, whose political theory aligns with this emphasis on constitutional authority. Despite partisan battles and contested language, the reading proceeded, with lawmakers taking turns reciting the document that grants them their legislative powers. This magical moment, full of moral purpose, marked a new era in Congress, where the Constitution would be the guiding light for all future legislation.
