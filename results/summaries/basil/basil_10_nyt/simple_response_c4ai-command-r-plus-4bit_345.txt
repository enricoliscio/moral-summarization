SUMMARY: Members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor on Thursday, setting the tone for the 112th Congress, in which every House bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading, meant to instruct members and inform voters about the Constitution's importance, was also a nod to the Tea Party movement, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The event was not without partisan battles, as Democrats and Republicans disagreed over the language and interpretation of the document. The full text of the Constitution has never been read aloud on the House Floor before, and the event underscores the importance of the Constitution in shaping the legislative process and national debate. END OF SUMMARY.
