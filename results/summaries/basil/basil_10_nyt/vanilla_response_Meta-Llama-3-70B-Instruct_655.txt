SUMMARY:

The 112th Congress began with a historic event as members of the House of Representatives read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor. The reading was part of the new rules package and aimed to instruct members, who must now cite the constitutional source of their bills, and inform voters. The event was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which emphasizes the importance of the Constitution in limiting federal powers. The reading was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. The event was briefly disrupted by a protester, who was removed by the sergeant-at-arms. The reading was done sentence by sentence, with members from both parties participating. This is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House Floor.
