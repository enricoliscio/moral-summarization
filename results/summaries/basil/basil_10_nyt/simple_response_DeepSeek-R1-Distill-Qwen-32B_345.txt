Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about the 112th Congress starting a new tradition where every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority. They began by reading the Constitution aloud in the House. The author sets a tone here, maybe implying that this is a significant move, perhaps a return to principles or a shift in governance.

Right at the beginning, there's some conflict. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, questions the Republicans about which parts of the Constitution they'll read and who decides. This shows some initial tension, maybe highlighting partisanship. The Republicans decide not to read parts superseded by amendments, avoiding controversial sections like the three-fifths clause or prohibition. This decision might be seen as avoiding uncomfortable truths or as practical.

The reading starts with the preamble by Boehner, then Pelosi, and others take turns. The author mentions the diversity of the readers, including women and African Americans, whose rights weren't recognized back then. This could be a moral point about progress or the ongoing struggle for equality.

There's a moment where a protester is removed, showing some disruption. The purpose of the reading is to educate members and inform voters, according to Goodlatte. He mentions constituents believing Congress has overstepped, tying this to the Tea Party movement. The article also notes that this reading coincided with the repeal of the healthcare law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional. This connects the reading to their political agenda.

Historically, this is a rare event, only done twice before. The author ends by noting the political implications, perhaps suggesting it's more symbolic than substantive.

So, the moral framing seems to critique the move as performative rather than substantive. It highlights the potential for partisanship and the selective reading of the Constitution. The author might be concerned that this gesture doesn't address real issues but serves political ends, especially with the Tea Party and healthcare repeal.

I need to capture these elements in the summary: the event, the initial conflict, the selective reading, the diversity of readers, the purpose mentioned by Goodlatte, the connection to the Tea Party and healthcare repeal, the historical context, and the critique that it's symbolic without real change.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points while reflecting the moral perspective presented.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began by reading the U.S. Constitution aloud, a move aimed at underscoring its authority for legislation. The process was marred by initial partisan conflict, with Democrats questioning the scope of the reading, which excluded amended sections to avoid controversial topics like slavery. The reading proceeded, with leaders like Boehner, Pelosi, and Cantor participating, symbolizing unity and constitutional adherence. The event highlighted progress, as diverse lawmakers, including women and African Americans, read the document. However, critics viewed the gesture as performative, noting its alignment with the Tea Party's emphasis on limited government and its timing with the repeal of the healthcare law. Historically rare, the reading was seen as more symbolic than substantive, reflecting political agendas rather than substantive constitutional commitment. END OF SUMMARY.
