Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the author used "remove" and "making" as morally framed words, so I should make sure to include those in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the 112th Congress starting by reading the Constitution aloud. There were some initial conflicts between Democrats and Republicans about what parts to read and who would read them. They decided not to include parts superseded by amendments, like the three-fifths clause, to avoid uncomfortable references. 

The reading started with the preamble by Boehner, then Pelosi, Cantor, and others took turns. It was the first time the Constitution was read aloud in the House. The purpose was to educate members and constituents, especially regarding the Tea Party's focus on constitutional limits. It also coincided with efforts to repeal the health care law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the morally framed words "remove" and "making." I should structure it to highlight the initial conflict, the decision to remove certain parts, the reading process, and the underlying motivations, including the Tea Party influence and the repeal effort. 

Let me draft that, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the setting, mention the conflict and removal of parts, then the reading process, and conclude with the purposes and the repeal context. That should cover all the key points while preserving the moral elements.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began by reading the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House, a move aimed at setting a tone of constitutional adherence. Before the reading started, Democrats and Republicans clashed over procedural details, with Democrats questioning which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. It was agreed to remove portions superseded by amendments, avoiding references to controversial topics like slavery. The reading commenced with Representative John Boehner reciting the preamble, followed by Nancy Pelosi and others. The event, part of a new rules package, was intended to instruct lawmakers and inform voters about the Constitution's limits on federal power. Representative Robert Goodlatte, who proposed the idea, emphasized its importance in addressing concerns about government overreach and sending a message to constituents. The reading also coincided with efforts to repeal the health care law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. This was the first time the Constitution was read aloud on the House floor, reflecting a broader push to revisit foundational principles. END OF SUMMARY.
