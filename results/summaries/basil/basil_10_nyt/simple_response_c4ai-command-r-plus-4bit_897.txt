SUMMARY: Members of the US House of Representatives began reading the Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress, where every House bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading was meant to instruct members on the importance of the Constitution and send a message to voters about the federal government's limited powers. It also served as a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is grounded in the Constitution. The event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans battled over the language and interpretation of the document. The reading was interrupted by a protester, who was removed from the chamber. Despite the partisan battles, the act of reading the Constitution aloud serves as a reminder of the rights and responsibilities of Congress and the federal government's limited powers as outlined in this foundational document. 

END OF SUMMARY.
