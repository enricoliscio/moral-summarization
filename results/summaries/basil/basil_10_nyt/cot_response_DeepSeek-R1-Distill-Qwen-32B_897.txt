Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with the first step, I'll read through the article to spot any words that carry moral connotations. Words like "auspiciously," "illuminated," "parliamentary," "constituted," "battled," "superseded," "prohibition," "expanded," "powers," "granted," "constituents," "message," "important," "nod," "contentious," "repeal," "basis," "extensions," "examples," and "precedents" stand out as they relate to moral or ethical implications in the context of the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, ensuring that the moral framing is maintained. I'll focus on the key events: the reading of the Constitution, the initial disagreements, the procedural decisions, the political implications, and the historical context. I'll make sure to include the identified morally framed words where appropriate to reflect the author's perspective on the events.

I should structure the summary to highlight the symbolic and political significance of the reading, the partisan disputes, and the underlying motivations, such as the Tea Party influence and the repeal of the health care law. This will convey the moral and political dimensions effectively within the word limit.
