SUMMARY:

In a historic move, the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on Thursday morning, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. However, the proceedings did not begin smoothly, with Democrats questioning the Republicans' plan to exclude certain parts of the Constitution, including references to slaves and prohibition. After a brief partisan battle, the reading commenced, with Representative John Boehner reading the preamble and yielding to Representative Nancy Pelosi. The reading served multiple purposes, including instructing members on the Constitution's importance and informing voters. It was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The event was marked by a brief interruption when a protester was removed from the chamber. The reading was a first in the House's history, with the goal of ensuring party parity and allowing all interested members to participate.
