SUMMARY:
The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor, a move meant to set a tone of accountability and adherence to the Constitution's authority. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats and Republicans clashed over the language and procedure of the reading. The decision to omit superseded portions, including references to slavery, was met with inquiries from Democrats, leading to a brief but contentious debate. Despite this, the reading proceeded, with members from both parties taking turns to read the document aloud. The event was seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement, which emphasizes the Constitution's role in limiting federal powers. The reading served as a reminder of the Constitution's importance and a message to voters that Congress must operate within its constitutional bounds. END OF SUMMARY.
