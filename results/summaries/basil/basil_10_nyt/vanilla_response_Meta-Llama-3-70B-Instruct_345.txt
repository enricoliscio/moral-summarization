SUMMARY:

The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor. The reading was part of the new rules package, which requires every House bill to cite its constitutional authority. The reading was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. The decision was made to skip superseded portions, including references to slavery and prohibition. After a brief partisan battle, the reading commenced, with Representative John Boehner reading the preamble and other members following. The event was seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The reading served to instruct members, inform voters, and send a message about the importance of the Constitution. This is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House floor.
