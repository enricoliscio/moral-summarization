Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the 112th Congress, specifically the House of Representatives, starting to read the U.S. Constitution aloud. It mentions that every House bill now must cite the constitutional authority. They began reading on Thursday morning, but it didn't start smoothly. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, asked about which parts would be read and who would decide, leading to some initial conflict between Democrats and Republicans. They decided not to read parts superseded by amendments, avoiding references to slavery and prohibition.

The reading started with the preamble by John Boehner, followed by Nancy Pelosi and Eric Cantor. Members from various districts, including women and African Americans, participated. There was a protest, and the sergeant-at-arms had to remove someone. The purpose was to instruct members and inform voters, especially since they need to reference the Constitution for bills. It was also aimed at the Tea Party, which emphasizes the Constitution. The reading coincided with efforts to repeal the health care law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional. This was the first time the Constitution was read aloud in the House, with previous instances only in the Congressional Record without being read aloud.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, highlighting the key points: the start of the 112th Congress, the reading of the Constitution, initial disagreements, the purpose, the participation, and the historical context. I should make sure to mention the political implications, especially regarding the Tea Party and the health care repeal.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began its session with the House of Representatives reading the U.S. Constitution aloud, marking a new rule requiring all bills to cite constitutional authority. The reading, initiated by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, aimed to educate members and constituents about the Constitution's limits on federal power, particularly resonating with the Tea Party movement. Initial disagreements over which parts to read arose, with amendments and superseded sections excluded to avoid controversial topics like slavery. The preamble was read by Speaker John Boehner, followed by Nancy Pelosi and Eric Cantor, with members from diverse backgrounds participating. A protest disrupted the session briefly. This was the first time the Constitution was read aloud in the House, following historical precedents where it was inserted into the Congressional Record without being read aloud. The event underscored the political focus on constitutional boundaries, coinciding with efforts to repeal the health care law. END OF SUMMARY.
