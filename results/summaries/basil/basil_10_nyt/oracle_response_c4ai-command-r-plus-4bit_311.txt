SUMMARY: Setting a tone for the 112th Congress, members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor on Thursday. The reading was meant to instruct members on the constitutional source of their authority and to inform voters about the importance of the document. However, before the reading began, there was a partisan battle over the language and parts of the Constitution to be omitted. The reading was eventually initiated by Speaker John A. Boehner, followed by Representative Nancy Pelosi and other House leaders. The act served as a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is based on the Constitution. The only previous instances of the Constitution being inserted into the Congressional Record were in 1882 and 1915, but it had never been read aloud in its entirety on the House Floor. During the reading, a protester was removed from the chamber.
