SUMMARY:

The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor, a move aimed at setting a tone of constitutional authority. However, the proceedings were marred by partisan bickering, with Democrats questioning the decision to omit superseded portions, including references to slaves and prohibition. After a brief delay, the reading commenced, with members taking turns to recite the document sentence by sentence. The event was meant to instruct members, inform voters, and send a message about the importance of the Constitution. It was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which cites the Constitution as the basis for its political theory. The reading was not without incident, as a protester was removed from the chamber. The event marked a rare occasion, with the Office of the Historian unable to find any previous instances of the full text of the Constitution being read aloud on the House floor.
