SUMMARY: On Thursday morning, members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. This act was meant to instruct members on the constitutional source of their authority and to inform voters about the importance of the document. Before the reading began, there was a debate between Democrats and Republicans over the language and parts of the Constitution to be omitted, particularly references to slaves and prohibition. Once these issues were settled, the reading commenced with the newly installed Speaker of the House, Representative John A. Boehner, reading the preamble. Other House leaders, including Representative Nancy Pelosi and Representative Eric Cantor, also participated in the reading. The act of reading the Constitution aloud was also meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a political movement that cites the Constitution as the basis for their political theory. The reading happened on the same day that House Republicans began the process of repealing the health care law, which they believe lacks a constitutional basis. According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, this is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House Floor.
