Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the 112th Congress starting to read the Constitution aloud. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says that the House of Representatives began reading the Constitution from the floor on Thursday morning. This is part of a new rule where every bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading started with some initial issues: Jay Inslee asked about which parts would be read and how it would be done. They decided to skip parts superseded by amendments, avoiding references to slavery and prohibition. This led to a brief partisan argument before they started.

Then, Boehner read the preamble, followed by Pelosi and Cantor. Members took turns reading, including women and African Americans, which is significant given the original document's context. There was a protester removed by the sergeant-at-arms.

Representative Goodlatte, who proposed the idea, said it's to educate members and the public, especially about the Constitution's limits on federal power. It's also aimed at the Tea Party, which emphasizes constitutional limits. The reading coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional.

Historically, this is the first time the full Constitution has been read aloud in the House, with previous instances only in the Congressional Record without being read out loud.

So, the summary should include the start of the reading, the reasons behind it, the initial disagreements, the significance of who read, the connection to the Tea Party, and the historical context.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to mention the event, the purpose, the procedural issues, the symbolic reading, the historical aspect, and the political context.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began reading the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives as part of a new rule requiring all bills to cite constitutional authority. The reading, proposed by Representative Robert Goodlatte, aimed to educate members and the public about constitutional limits on federal power, particularly resonating with the Tea Party movement. Initial disagreements arose over which parts to read, with amendments and superseded sections excluded to avoid controversial references. After a brief partisan debate, the reading commenced, starting with the preamble by Speaker John Boehner, followed by Nancy Pelosi and Eric Cantor. Members, including women and African Americans, took turns reading, symbolizing progress since the document's inception. The event coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, deemed unconstitutional by Republicans. This marks the first time the full Constitution was read aloud in the House, with prior instances only appearing in the Congressional Record. END OF SUMMARY.
