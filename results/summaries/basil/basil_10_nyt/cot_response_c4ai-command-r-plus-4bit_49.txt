SUMMARY:
In an act of moral and political symbolism, members of the House of Representatives read the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor. This act set the tone for the 112th Congress, where every House bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading was not without moral battles, as Democrats and Republicans clashed over the issue of language and the interpretation of the document. The event also paid homage to the Tea Party movement, whose political theory is grounded in the Constitution. The reading was briefly interrupted by a protester, highlighting the contentious nature of the undertaking. According to historical records, this was the first time the full text of the Constitution was read aloud on the House Floor, marking a significant moment in the history of American democracy and governance.
