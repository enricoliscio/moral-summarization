SUMMARY: Setting a tone for the 112th Congress — in which every House bill must cite its constitutional authority — members of the House of Representatives began reading the United States Constitution aloud on the chamber's floor on Thursday. Before the reading began, there was a heated debate between Democrats and Republicans over which parts of the Constitution would be read and which would be removed. Once this was settled, the reading commenced, with Speaker John Boehner reading the preamble, followed by Representative Nancy Pelosi reading Article 1, Section 1. Other members who wished to participate were recognized from their seats. The reading of the Constitution served multiple purposes, including instructing members on its content and underscoring the importance of constitutional authority to voters, particularly those aligned with the Tea Party movement. This unique event in the history of the House of Representatives highlighted the ongoing debate about federal powers and the role of Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
