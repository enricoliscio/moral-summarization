Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the words "remove" and "making" as they are morally framed. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the 112th Congress starting by reading the Constitution aloud. There were some initial conflicts between Democrats and Republicans about what parts to read, especially avoiding sections that reference slavery. This seems like a moral decision to "remove" problematic parts. 

Then, the reading began with various leaders taking turns. The purpose was to educate members and inform the public, which is a positive "making" of a message. The event was also aimed at the Tea Party, emphasizing constitutional limits, and coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which they saw as unconstitutional.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral elements. I'll highlight the decision to remove certain parts and the making of a message about the Constitution's importance. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the reading event, the removal of parts, the purpose behind it, and its alignment with the Tea Party's views.

Let me structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the event, then the conflict, the reading process, the reasons behind it, and its significance. I'll ensure that "remove" and "making" are included where appropriate to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The 112th Congress began by reading the U.S. Constitution aloud, a move aimed at setting a tone of constitutional fidelity. The process was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned the procedure, leading to a partisan debate over which parts of the Constitution would be read. Certain sections, including those referencing slavery and prohibition, were removed to avoid sensitive language. Despite the initial conflict, the reading proceeded, with leaders like Speaker John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi taking turns. The event was designed to educate lawmakers and constituents about the Constitution’s limits on federal power, a message particularly aimed at the Tea Party movement. The reading also coincided with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans argued lacked constitutional basis. The exercise, unprecedented in modern history, sought to "remove" ambiguity about Congress’s authority while "making" a clear statement about the document’s enduring importance. END OF SUMMARY.
