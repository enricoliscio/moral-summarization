SUMMARY: In an act of moral and political significance, the United States Constitution was read aloud on the House floor, setting the tone for the 112th Congress. This act, intended to instruct lawmakers and inform voters about the Constitution's importance, was also a nod to the Tea Party, whose political theory is grounded in the document. The reading was not without moral controversy, as Democrats and Republicans battled over language, presaging future partisan battles over the document's interpretation. Once settled, Speaker John Boehner read the preamble, yielding to Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1. The order of reading aimed to ensure party parity and allowed all interested members to participate. The full text of the Constitution had never been read aloud on the House floor before, although there were two prior instances of its insertion into the Congressional Record in 1882 and 1915, appended and inserted respectively. END OF SUMMARY.
