SUMMARY:

The 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the United States Constitution on the House floor. The reading was part of the new rules package, aiming to instruct members and inform voters. Republicans initiated the reading, citing the Constitution as the basis for their political theory. The document was read sentence by sentence, with members from both parties participating. However, the event was not without controversy, as Democrats questioned the selection of passages to be read and the parliamentary procedure. The reading excluded superseded portions, including references to slavery and prohibition. The event was seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which emphasizes the Constitution's importance in limiting federal powers. This is the first time the full text of the Constitution has been read aloud on the House floor, with only two prior instances of it being inserted into the Congressional Record. The reading served as a precursor to the contentious process of repealing the health care law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis.
