SUMMARY:

In a symbolic gesture, the House of Representatives began the 112th Congress by reading the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor. However, the event was marred by partisan bickering over the procedure, with Democrats questioning which parts of the Constitution would be read and who would decide. The reading ultimately proceeded, with Republicans and Democrats taking turns reciting the document's sentences. The event was meant to instruct members on the Constitution's importance and to inform voters, but it was also seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement, which emphasizes the document's role in limiting federal powers. The reading took place on the same day that House Republicans began the process of repealing the health care law, which they claim lacks constitutional basis. The event marks a rare instance of the Constitution being read aloud on the House Floor, with only two prior instances of the document being inserted into the Congressional Record.
