Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the House reading the Constitution. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

So, the 112th Congress started, and the House began reading the Constitution aloud. It's part of new rules where every bill must cite its constitutional authority. The reading was on Thursday morning. Before it started, there was some debate between Democrats and Republicans about which parts to read. They decided not to include parts superseded by amendments, avoiding references to slavery and prohibition. This caused some tension before the reading began.

John Boehner read the preamble, then Nancy Pelosi continued with Article 1, followed by Eric Cantor and others. The reading was done by various members, including women and African Americans, reflecting the diversity not present when the Constitution was written. There was a protest that led to someone being removed.

The purpose of the reading was to educate members and inform voters, especially since the Tea Party movement emphasizes the Constitution. It also coincided with efforts to repeal the health care law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional.

This was a rare event; the last time the Constitution was read aloud in the House was not found, though it was inserted into the Congressional Record in 1882 and 1915.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, focusing on the key events and reasons behind the reading. I'll mention the 112th Congress, the new rule, the initial debate, the reading process, the symbolic gesture, the repeal of the healthcare law, and the historical context.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important point is included without going into too much detail.
