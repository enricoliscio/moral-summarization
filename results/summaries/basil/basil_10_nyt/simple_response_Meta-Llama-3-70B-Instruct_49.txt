SUMMARY:

In a symbolic gesture, the House of Representatives began the 112th Congress by reading the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber's floor. However, the event was marred by partisan bickering, with Democrats questioning the procedure and Republicans pushing forward with the reading. The decision to exclude superseded portions, including references to slavery, sparked controversy. Despite the rocky start, the reading continued, with members from diverse backgrounds and districts taking turns to read the document. The event was seen as an attempt to instruct members and inform voters about the Constitution's importance, as well as a nod to the Tea Party movement. The reading also coincided with the start of the repeal process of the health care law, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional basis. This historic event marks a rare instance of the Constitution being read aloud on the House Floor.
