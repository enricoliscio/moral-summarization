Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the 112th Congress starting a session where every House bill must cite the constitutional authority. On Thursday, they began reading the US Constitution aloud from the floor. 

The process started with some initial disagreements. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, questioned what parts would be read and who would decide. They decided to skip parts superseded by amendments to avoid controversial sections like those referring to slaves. This led to a brief partisan battle over parliamentary procedures.

Once that was settled, John Boehner read the preamble, followed by Nancy Pelosi and Eric Cantor. Members from various districts, including women and African Americans, took turns reading. A protester was removed during the reading. 

The purpose of this reading, according to Robert Goodlatte, was to educate members and voters about the Constitution, especially as they now have to reference it for bills. It's also seen as a nod to the Tea Party, which emphasizes constitutional limits on federal power. The reading coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional.

Historically, this was only the third time the Constitution was read aloud in the House, with previous instances in 1882 and 1915, but not aloud.

So, the key points are: the 112th Congress started reading the Constitution, initial disagreements, the process, the reasons behind it, its political significance, and the historical context.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main actions, the reasons, and the significance. I'll make sure to mention the initial disagreements, who read which parts, the purpose, and the historical aspect.

SUMMARY: The 112th Congress began its session with members of the U.S. House reading the Constitution aloud, a move aimed at emphasizing constitutional authority for all legislation. The reading, initiated by Republican Robert Goodlatte, faced initial partisan disputes over which sections to include, with Democrats questioning the process. Controversial parts, like those referencing slavery, were excluded. After resolving the disputes, the preamble was read by Speaker John Boehner, followed by Pelosi and Cantor, with other members taking turns. The event highlighted the Constitution's importance and was seen as a nod to the Tea Party movement. It coincided with efforts to repeal the healthcare law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional. This was the first time the full Constitution was read aloud in the House since 1882 and 1915.
