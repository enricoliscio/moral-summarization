Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the 112th Congress starting by reading the Constitution. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the underlying tone.

The article starts by mentioning that the 112th Congress began with reading the Constitution, a new rule where every bill must cite its constitutional authority. They started reading it aloud, but there were some initial hiccups. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, questioned the process, asking which parts would be read and who decided. They agreed to skip parts superseded by amendments, avoiding references like the three-fifths clause or prohibition. This led to a partisan battle over the reading process.

Once they started, Boehner read the preamble, Pelosi followed with Article 1, then Cantor and others took turns. The reading included diverse members, some of whom wouldn't have been allowed to participate when the Constitution was written. There was a protest with the sergeant-at-arms called in. 

Representative Goodlatte, a Republican, said the reading aimed to educate members and inform voters, especially regarding the expansion of federal power. It was also a nod to the Tea Party, which emphasizes constitutional limits. The reading coincided with the repeal of the health care law, which Republicans argue is unconstitutional. 

Historically, this was only the third time the Constitution was read aloud in the House, with previous instances in 1882 and 1915.

Now, considering the moral framing. The author seems to highlight the symbolic importance of the reading, showing a return to foundational principles. The initial conflict between parties underscores the ongoing debates over the Constitution's role in limiting government power. The inclusion of diverse members reflects progress but also the unresolved issues of the past. The link to the Tea Party indicates a broader movement emphasizing constitutionalism. The repeal of the health care law ties into the idea that Congress is overstepping its authority, which is a key moral argument for some.

So, the summary should capture these elements: the symbolic reading, the initial partisan conflict, the educational purpose, the nod to the Tea Party, and the historical context. It should also mention the diversity of participants and the protest, showing the complexities and symbolic nature of the event.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral aspects are clear. The tone should reflect the symbolic gesture and the underlying political and moral debates.

SUMMARY:  
The 112th Congress began its session with a symbolic reading of the U.S. Constitution, a move aimed at emphasizing constitutional authority and limiting federal overreach. The reading, initiated by Republicans, faced initial partisan disputes over which sections to include, particularly avoiding references to slavery and prohibition. Despite tensions, the session proceeded, with lawmakers from diverse backgrounds, including women and African Americans, taking turns to read the document. The event, championed by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, was intended to educate members and voters about constitutional limits on federal power, while also aligning with the Tea Party movement's focus on constitutional principles. The reading coincided with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans argue lacks constitutional grounding. This marked only the third time the Constitution has been read aloud in the House, highlighting its symbolic significance in reaffirming foundational principles. END OF SUMMARY.
