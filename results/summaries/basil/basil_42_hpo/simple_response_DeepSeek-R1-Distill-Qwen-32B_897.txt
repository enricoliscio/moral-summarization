Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

So, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill called SB 1062. The bill would have allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which effectively would have allowed discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill could create more problems than it solves and that there were no examples of religious liberty being violated. 

The bill was passed by the state legislature but faced a lot of criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Notably, Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain urged her to veto it. Major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines also opposed it. There was also concern about the impact on Arizona's economy, especially with the Super Bowl coming up in Glendale. The host committee warned that the bill would harm economic growth.

Additionally, similar bills are being considered in other states like Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect, which is about discrimination and the potential negative economic impact. I should mention Brewer's reasoning, the opposition from various groups, and the broader context of similar legislation elsewhere. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.
