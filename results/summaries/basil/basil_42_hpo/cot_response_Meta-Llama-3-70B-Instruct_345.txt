SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and that she hadn't heard of any instances where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The bill faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating that it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential." Similar bills have been introduced in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. By vetoing the bill, Brewer protected the rights of same-sex couples and upheld the values of freedom and equality. END OF SUMMARY.
