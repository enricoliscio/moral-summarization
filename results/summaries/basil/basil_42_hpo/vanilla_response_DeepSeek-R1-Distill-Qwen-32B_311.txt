Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill called SB 1062. The bill would have allowed businesses to refuse service to people based on religious freedom, which effectively would let them discriminate against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill could cause more problems than it solves and that she hasn't heard of any actual violations of religious liberty in Arizona. The state legislature passed the bill, but it faced a lot of criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Even the state's Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain asked Brewer to veto it. Major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines opposed it too. There was also concern about the Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, in 2015, with the host committee saying the bill would hurt the state's economy. Similar bills are popping up in other states like Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. The article had a correction about the Super Bowl location.

So, the main points are: Brewer vetoed SB 1062, which would allow discrimination under religious freedom. She cited lack of evidence and potential problems. The bill faced opposition from many, including businesses and senators. The Super Bowl's host committee worried about economic impact. Other states are considering similar bills.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Brewer's action, explain the bill, her reasons, opposition, Super Bowl context, and mention other states. Keep it concise and clear.

Let me structure it: 

1. Brewer vetoes SB 1062.
2. Bill allowed discrimination under religious freedom.
3. She said it creates more problems, no violations reported.
4. Opposition from activists, lawmakers, businesses.
5. Super Bowl host committee worried about economic impact.
6. Similar bills in other states.

Now, put it all together in a coherent summary, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
