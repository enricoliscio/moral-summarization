SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to legally refuse service to same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively permitting discrimination. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and that she hadn't heard of any instance where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The veto comes after intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, who expressed opposition to the bill. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also spoke out against the bill, stating that it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential" and run contrary to the goal of promoting Arizona as a welcoming destination. The veto is seen as a victory for those who advocate for equality and reject discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
