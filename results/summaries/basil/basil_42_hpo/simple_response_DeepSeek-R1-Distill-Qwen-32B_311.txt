Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill called SB 1062. The bill would have allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill didn't address a real issue and could cause more problems. She also mentioned she hadn't heard of any religious liberty violations by business owners.

The bill passed the state legislature but faced criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain asked her to veto it. Major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines opposed it too. There were concerns about the Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, with the host committee saying the bill would harm the state's economy.

Similar bills are appearing in other states like Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine.

So, the key points are: Brewer vetoed SB 1062, which would allow discrimination under religious freedom. She cited lack of real issues and potential problems. There was opposition from various groups, including businesses worried about the Super Bowl's economic impact. Other states are considering similar bills.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect, which is the opposition to discrimination and the potential negative impact on the state's economy and image.

I'll structure the summary to include Brewer's decision, the bill's purpose, her reasoning, the opposition, and the broader context of similar bills elsewhere.

Let me draft it concisely, keeping it under 200 words.
