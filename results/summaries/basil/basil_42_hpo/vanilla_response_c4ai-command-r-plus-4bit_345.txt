SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively legalizing discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer cited concerns that the bill could create more problems than it solves and that there were no examples of business owners' religious liberties being violated. The bill, SB 1062, had faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating it would hurt the state's economic growth potential. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine, sparking controversy and opposition. The veto by Brewer is seen as a significant victory for LGBT rights and equality. END OF SUMMARY.
