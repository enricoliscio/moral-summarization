SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples based on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer stated that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it solved and did not address a specific concern related to religious liberty in Arizona. The bill, known as SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature last week but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests. Major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, as well as the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, opposed the bill, citing concerns about its impact on the state's economy and reputation. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. Brewer's veto is seen as a victory for advocates of LGBTQ rights.
