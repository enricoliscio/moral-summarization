Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Brewer vetoed legislation that would have let businesses refuse service based on religious freedom, potentially allowing discrimination against same-sex couples. She felt the bill would create more problems than it solved. She also noted that there were no examples of religious liberty violations by business owners. 

The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced a lot of criticism. Key figures like Arizona's Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain urged her to veto it. Major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines opposed it too. There was also concern from local businesses in Phoenix, especially with the Super Bowl coming up in Glendale in 2015. The host committee there opposed the bill, saying it would harm the state's economy.

The article also mentions that similar bills are being pushed in other states like Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. Oh, and there's a correction about the Super Bowl location from Tempe to Glendale.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Brewer's veto, the bill's purpose, her reasoning, the opposition from senators and corporations, the Super Bowl concern, and the similar bills elsewhere. I should make sure it's concise and captures the essence without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with Brewer's decision, her reasoning, the opposition, the economic impact via the Super Bowl, and mention the other states. Keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.
