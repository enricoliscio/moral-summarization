SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples, citing concerns about the potential for creating more problems and the lack of evidence of religious liberty violations. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating it would harm the state's economic growth. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, allowing for open discrimination against same-sex couples. This courageous decision by Gov. Brewer sets a moral example for other states and promotes equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. It sends a clear message that discrimination will not be tolerated and that businesses should welcome all customers equally. This veto is a victory for moral decency and a step towards ensuring that all citizens are treated with fairness and dignity. END OF SUMMARY.
