SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, which would have effectively legalized discrimination against same-sex couples. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating it would harm the state's economic growth potential. Gov. Brewer stated that the bill did not address a specific concern related to religious liberty and that she had not heard of any examples where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine, sparking controversy and opposition.
END OF SUMMARY.
