SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to legally discriminate against same-sex couples on the basis of "religious freedom." The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Governor Brewer stated that the bill did not address any specific religious liberty concerns in Arizona and had the potential to create more problems than it solved. The bill was opposed by Republican senators, major corporations, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, who all expressed concerns about the negative impact on the state's economy and image. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, but Arizona's decision sends a strong message against discrimination and in favor of moral values and economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
