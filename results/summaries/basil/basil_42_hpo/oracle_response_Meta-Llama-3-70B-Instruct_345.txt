SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively legalizing discrimination. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and that she hadn't heard of any instances where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The bill, known as SB 1062, faced intense opposition from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Even the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee came out against the bill, stating that it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential." Similar bills aimed at legalizing discrimination against same-sex couples have been popping up in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. By vetoing the bill, Brewer stood against discrimination and protected the state's economy from a potential blow. END OF SUMMARY.
