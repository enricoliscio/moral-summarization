SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to legally discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. The bill, known as SB 1062, faced intense criticism and opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, who raised concerns about the potential for discrimination and the violation of religious liberty. Governor Brewer agreed that the bill did not address any present concerns related to religious liberty in Arizona and had the potential to create more problems than it solved. Similar controversial bills have been introduced in other states, sparking controversy and debate about the balance between religious freedom and discrimination. This decision highlights the ongoing struggle to find a balance between religious freedom and protecting the rights of all citizens, including same-sex couples, from discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
