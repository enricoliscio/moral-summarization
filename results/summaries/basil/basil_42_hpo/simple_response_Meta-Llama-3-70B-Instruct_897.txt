SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples based on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer recognized that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it claimed to solve and did not address a specific concern related to religious liberty in Arizona. The bill was widely criticized by activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, citing concerns that it would harm the state's economic growth potential. This decision sets a positive precedent, as similar discriminatory bills have been proposed in other states. By vetoing this bill, Governor Brewer upheld the principles of equality, fairness, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

END OF SUMMARY.
