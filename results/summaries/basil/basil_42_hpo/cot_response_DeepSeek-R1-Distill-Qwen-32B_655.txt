Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the query. The user wants two things: first, identify all the morally framed single words, and second, write a concise summary that includes those words.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. The article mentions criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations opposing the bill. There's also a mention of the Super Bowl location and other states with similar bills.

For the first step, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "veto," "discriminate," "criticism," "opposition," "potential," "problems," "concern," "violated," "oppose," "concerns," "blow," "growth," "oppose," "potential," "concerns," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose." These words seem to carry moral weight because they relate to rights, discrimination, opposition, and consequences.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into under 200 words, keeping those moral words. I should mention Brewer's veto, the bill's purpose, the criticism it received, the opposition from various groups, the impact on Arizona's economy, and the broader context of similar bills in other states.

I'll structure it by stating Brewer's action, the bill's intent, the criticism, opposition from key figures and businesses, the economic implications, and the nationwide trend. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

Let me draft it: Start with Brewer's veto, mention the bill's purpose, then the criticism and opposition. Highlight the economic concerns, especially regarding the Super Bowl. End with the trend in other states. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I think that covers all the points. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate to preserve the author's moral stance against the bill.

**SUMMARY:**  
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed Senate Bill 1062, which would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples under "religious freedom" grounds, effectively enabling discrimination. Brewer criticized the bill, stating it created more problems than it aimed to solve and lacked evidence of religious liberty violations. The bill faced intense opposition from activists, lawmakers, and major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Arizona's Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, also urged Brewer to veto it. Local businesses feared economic repercussions, especially with the Super Bowl scheduled for Glendale in 2015. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee opposed the bill, warning it would harm the state's economic growth. Similar discriminatory bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. END OF SUMMARY.
