Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Brewer vetoed legislation that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, potentially discriminating against same-sex couples. She said the bill could create more problems than it solves and that there were no examples of religious liberty violations by business owners.

The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced criticism from various groups. Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain, along with major companies like Marriott and Apple, opposed it. There were also concerns about the impact on Arizona's economy, especially with the Super Bowl coming up in Glendale.

Additionally, similar bills are being considered in other states like Tennessee and South Dakota. The article also corrects a mistake about the Super Bowl location.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Brewer's veto, her reasons, opposition from senators and businesses, economic concerns, and the broader context of similar bills elsewhere.

I should structure it to include the key actors, the bill's content, the reasons for the veto, opposition, and the correction. I'll make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.
