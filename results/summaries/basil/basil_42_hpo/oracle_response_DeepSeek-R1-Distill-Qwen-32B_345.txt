Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify those key terms.

The article talks about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing legislation that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. The words here include "veto," "refuse," "discriminate," "create," "liberty," "violated," "opposition," "against," "contrary," "blow," "pushing," "discrimination," and "popping."

I should structure the summary to highlight Brewer's decision to veto the bill, the reasons she gave, and the opposition from various groups. I need to make sure each of these moral words is included where appropriate. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me start by stating Brewer's action, then her reasoning, followed by the opposition and the broader context of similar bills in other states. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone and emphasis.

SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed legislation that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples under "religious freedom" grounds, effectively enabling discrimination. Brewer argued the bill, SB 1062, could "create more problems than it purports to solve" and noted no examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated. The bill faced intense opposition from activists, lawmakers, and major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain also urged Brewer to veto it. Local businesses in Phoenix, including the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, expressed concerns that the legislation could harm the state's economic growth and contradict its goals. Similar bills have been "pushing" for passage in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. Brewer's veto reflects a stance against discrimination and upholds principles of equality and religious liberty. END OF SUMMARY.
