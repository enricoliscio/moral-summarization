Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill called SB 1062. The bill would have allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, potentially discriminating against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill had more potential problems than solutions and didn't address any current issues related to religious liberty. She also mentioned she hadn't heard of any business owner's religious rights being violated.

The bill was passed by the state legislature but faced criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Even the state's Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain urged her to veto it. Major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines opposed it, as did local Phoenix businesses worried about the upcoming Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. The Super Bowl Host Committee stated the bill would harm the state's economy.

Similar bills are appearing in other states like Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. There's also a correction noting the Super Bowl location was initially misreported as Tempe but is actually Glendale.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key elements: Brewer's veto, the bill's purpose, her reasons, opposition from various groups, the Super Bowl impact, and similar legislation elsewhere.

I should structure it to first mention the veto, then the bill's intent, Brewer's reasoning, opposition, and the broader context of similar bills. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all main points without unnecessary details. I'll also check the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed Senate Bill 1062, which would have allowed businesses to refuse service to individuals based on "religious freedom," potentially enabling discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer stated the bill could create more problems than it aimed to solve and cited a lack of evidence showing religious liberty violations by business owners. The bill faced widespread opposition, including from Arizona's Republican senators, major corporations, and local businesses concerned about the state's economic reputation, especially with the Super Bowl scheduled for Glendale in 2015. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee warned the legislation could harm the state's economic growth. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. END OF SUMMARY.
