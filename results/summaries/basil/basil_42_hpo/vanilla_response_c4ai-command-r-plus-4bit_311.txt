SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, which could have led to discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer stated that the bill did not address any specific concerns related to religious liberty in Arizona and had the potential to create more problems. The bill, SB 1062, had faced intense criticism from various groups, including activists, lawmakers, businesses, and even Republican senators from Arizona. Many believed that the bill would be detrimental to the state's economic growth, especially with the Super Bowl set to take place in Arizona in 2015. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, such as Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine, sparking controversy and debate.
END OF SUMMARY.
