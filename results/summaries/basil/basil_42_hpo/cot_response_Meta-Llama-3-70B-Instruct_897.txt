SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively permitting open discrimination. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and didn't address a specific concern related to religious liberty in Arizona. The veto came after intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, who expressed opposition to the bill. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential." Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. By vetoing the bill, Brewer protected the rights of same-sex couples and upheld the values of freedom and liberty. END OF SUMMARY.
