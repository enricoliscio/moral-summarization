SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone based on "religious freedom," effectively allowing discrimination against same-sex couples. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, citing potential economic harm. Gov. Brewer stated the bill didn't address any specific concerns related to religious liberty and had the potential to create more problems. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine, sparking controversy and debate.
END OF SUMMARY.
