SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on religious grounds, effectively discriminating against same-sex couples. Brewer stated that the bill could create more problems than it solves and that there are no examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated in Arizona. The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Major corporations and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee opposed the bill, stating that it would hurt the state's economic growth potential. Arizona is not the only state pushing such discriminatory legislation; similar bills have been popping up in several other states. The veto of SB 1062 is a victory for those who oppose discrimination and support liberty for all.
END OF SUMMARY.
