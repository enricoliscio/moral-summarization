SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, a decision that opposes discrimination. The bill, SB 1062, was criticized for its potential to create problems and violate religious liberty, with no current examples of such violations. The bill faced strong opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, as well as the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee. Similar bills are being pushed in other states, allowing discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer's veto sends a message against discrimination and protects the liberty of all citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
