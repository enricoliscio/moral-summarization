SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to legally discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. The bill, SB 1062, had sparked intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, who argued that it would have enabled and encouraged discrimination. Governor Brewer agreed, stating that the bill did not address any specific religious liberty concerns in Arizona and had the potential to create more problems than it solved. The bill was opposed by various businesses and organizations, including Marriott, Apple, American Airlines, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, who believed it would harm the state's economic growth potential. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, such as Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine, raising concerns about open discrimination against same-sex couples being legalized across the country. This veto sends a strong message against such discriminatory legislation and in favor of equality and fairness for all. END OF SUMMARY.
