Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. She felt the bill would create more problems and didn't address a real issue. The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the legislature but faced opposition from various groups, including business interests and even Republican senators. Companies like Marriott and Apple opposed it, fearing it would harm Arizona's economy, especially with the Super Bowl coming up. Similar bills are appearing in other states.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: veto, refuse, discriminate, create, liberty, violated, opposition, against, contrary, blow, pushing, discrimination, popping. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll start by stating Brewer's veto, using "veto" and "discriminate." Then mention her reasoning about the bill's potential to create problems and not addressing real concerns. Include that she hadn't heard of religious liberty violations. Then note the opposition from lawmakers, businesses, and the Super Bowl committee, using words like "opposition," "against," "contrary," and "blow." Finally, mention other states pushing similar bills, using "pushing" and "discrimination," and "popping up."

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered with the moral terms.

SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed legislation that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to individuals based on "religious freedom," effectively enabling discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer argued the bill, SB 1062, had the potential to create more problems than it aimed to solve and did not address any specific concerns related to religious liberty. She noted no examples of religious liberty violations by business owners. The bill faced opposition from lawmakers, major corporations like Marriott and Apple, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, which warned it could deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth. Similar bills are popping up in other states, reflecting a broader push to allow open discrimination against same-sex couples. END OF SUMMARY.
