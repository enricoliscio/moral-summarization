SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively legalizing discrimination against same-sex couples. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating it would harm the state's economic growth potential. Gov. Brewer said the bill did not address any specific or present concerns related to religious liberty and had the potential to create more problems. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine, allowing discrimination against same-sex couples.
END OF SUMMARY.
