SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples based on "religious freedom" grounds. The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Brewer stated that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it solved and that she had not heard of any instances where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The veto was supported by major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, as well as the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, which feared the bill would harm the state's economy. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine.

END OF SUMMARY.
