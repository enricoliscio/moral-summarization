Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill called SB 1062. The bill would have allowed businesses to refuse service to people based on religious freedom, which effectively could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill could create more problems and that there were no examples of religious liberty violations by business owners. The bill was passed by the state legislature but faced criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Notably, Republican senators Flake and McCain, along with major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines opposed it. There was also concern about the Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, with the host committee opposing the bill, fearing it would harm the state's economy. Similar bills are appearing in other states.

I need to capture the key points: Brewer's veto, the bill's intent, her reasoning, opposition from various groups, economic concerns, and the broader context of similar bills elsewhere. I should highlight the moral aspect, which is about discrimination and religious freedom. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and structured to show the conflict between religious rights and anti-discrimination principles, with Brewer's stance against the bill.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Brewer vetoing SB 1062, explain the bill's purpose, her reasons, mention the opposition, economic impact, and note similar bills in other states. Make sure to keep the moral framing intact, emphasizing the potential for discrimination and the criticism it received.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me put it all together, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.
