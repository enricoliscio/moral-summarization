SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples under the guise of "religious freedom". The bill, SB 1062, was widely criticized by activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Even Arizona's two Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, urged Brewer to veto the bill. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, citing concerns that it would harm the state's economy and contradict the values of inclusivity and respect. Brewer rightly recognized that the bill was a solution in search of a problem, and that it would have created more problems than it claimed to solve. By vetoing this discriminatory legislation, Brewer upheld the values of equality, fairness, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

END OF SUMMARY.
