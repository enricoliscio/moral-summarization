Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on using the morally framed words they provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, effectively allowing discrimination against same-sex couples. She felt the bill created more problems than it solved. The author uses words like veto, refuse, discriminate, create, liberty, violated, opposition, against, contrary, blow, pushing, discrimination, popping.

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll outline the main points: Brewer vetoed SB 1062, which would have allowed discrimination. She criticized the bill, saying it didn't address real issues and had potential problems. There was opposition from various groups, including senators and major companies. The Super Bowl's host committee opposed it, fearing economic repercussions. Similar bills are appearing in other states.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to include all the key moral terms. I'll start with Brewer vetoing the bill, then mention the criticism, the opposition from senators and businesses, the Super Bowl angle, and the trend in other states. I need to keep it within the word limit and flow naturally.

Let me draft it: 

"Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed legislation that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples under religious freedom, effectively enabling discrimination. Brewer criticized the bill, stating it created more problems than it aimed to solve and did not address any specific religious liberty concerns. The bill faced opposition from lawmakers, business leaders, and activists, with major corporations like Marriott and Apple expressing their disapproval. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, warning it would harm the state's economic growth. Similar discriminatory bills are popping up in other states, signaling a broader trend. Brewer's veto reflects a stance against such measures, emphasizing the potential negative impact on both social and economic fronts."

I think this covers all the necessary points and includes the moral terms. Let me check the word count. It's around 150 words, so it fits. I'll make sure all the key points are there and the moral framing is preserved.
