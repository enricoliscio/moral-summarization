SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill, SB 1062, claimed to protect religious freedom, but Brewer argued that it would create more problems than it solved and that there were no examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated in Arizona. The bill faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, who argued that it would harm the state's economy and reputation. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, allowing discrimination against same-sex couples in the name of "religious freedom." This trend is a dangerous assault on the moral principle of equality and respect for all, and it is encouraging to see Gov. Brewer and other leaders take a stand against such discriminatory legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
