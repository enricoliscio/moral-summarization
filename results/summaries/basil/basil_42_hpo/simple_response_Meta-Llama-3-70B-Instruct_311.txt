SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples under the guise of "religious freedom". Brewer recognized that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it claimed to solve, and that there was no evidence of business owners' religious liberty being violated. The bill was widely criticized by activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Even the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee opposed the bill, fearing it would harm the state's economic growth potential. This decision sets a positive precedent, promoting equality and rejecting discrimination. By vetoing this bill, Brewer upheld the values of fairness, justice, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

END OF SUMMARY.
