SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. The bill, SB 1062, had passed the state legislature but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses. Brewer said the bill had no place and would create more problems than it purported to solve, as there were no examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated in Arizona. The bill was opposed by major corporations and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, which stated that the bill would hurt the state's economic growth potential. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, allowing for open discrimination against same-sex couples. This brave decision by Gov. Brewer sends a strong message against discrimination and for equality, showing that such unjustified and harmful bills have no place in law.
END OF SUMMARY.
