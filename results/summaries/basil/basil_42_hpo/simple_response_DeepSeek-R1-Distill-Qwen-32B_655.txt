Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, effectively allowing discrimination against same-sex couples.

First, I should identify the key points. The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the legislature but faced criticism from various groups. Brewer vetoed it, citing that it didn't address a real issue and could cause more problems. She mentioned not hearing any examples of religious liberty violations. There was opposition from major corporations and local businesses, especially with the Super Bowl coming to Arizona, which could impact the state's economy.

The moral framing here is about discrimination and the potential negative economic impact. The author presents the veto as a positive step against allowing discrimination, supported by business interests and political figures.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: Brewer's veto, the reason she gave, the opposition from businesses and politicians, the economic concerns, and the broader context of similar bills in other states.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well, highlighting the moral stance against discrimination and the practical reasons for the veto.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduce Brewer's veto of SB 1062.
2. Mention her reasoning about the bill not addressing a real issue and the potential problems.
3. Note the opposition from major corporations and local businesses.
4. Highlight the Super Bowl's role in economic concerns.
5. Conclude with the broader context of similar bills in other states.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and within the word limit. Also, ensure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed SB 1062, a bill allowing businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples on religious freedom grounds, stating it could create more problems than it aimed to solve. Brewer noted the bill didn't address a specific religious liberty issue and cited no examples of violations. The legislation faced opposition from major corporations, local businesses, and political figures, including Arizona's Republican senators. Concerns arose over the Super Bowl's economic impact if held in Arizona, with the host committee opposing the bill. Similar anti-LGBTQ+ bills are emerging in other states. Brewer's veto was seen as a stance against discrimination, supported by business and political interests. END OF SUMMARY.
