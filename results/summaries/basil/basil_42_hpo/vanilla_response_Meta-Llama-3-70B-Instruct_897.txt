SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples based on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer stated that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it solved and that she had not heard of any instances where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The bill, known as SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, citing concerns that it would harm the state's economic growth potential. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine.

END OF SUMMARY.
