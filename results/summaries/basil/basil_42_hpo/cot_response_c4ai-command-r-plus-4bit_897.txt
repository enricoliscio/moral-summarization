SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to legally refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively enabling them to discriminate against same-sex couples. Brewer cited the bill's potential to create more problems and the lack of any present concerns related to religious liberty in Arizona. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism and opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. There were also concerns about the potential impact on the 2015 Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, as businesses in the Phoenix area worried about the message it would send to visitors. Similar bills pushing open discrimination against same-sex couples have emerged in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. However, Brewer's decision demonstrates a commitment to ensuring that Arizona does not condone such discriminatory practices.
