SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples under the guise of "religious freedom." The bill, SB 1062, was widely criticized by activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Even the state's two Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, urged Brewer to veto the bill. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, citing concerns about the negative impact on the state's economy. Brewer rightly recognized that the bill was a solution in search of a problem, as she had not heard of a single instance where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. By vetoing this discriminatory legislation, Brewer upheld the principles of equality and fairness, and sent a strong message that Arizona will not tolerate discrimination against its citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
