SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to legally refuse service to same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively permitting discrimination. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and did not address a specific concern related to religious liberty in Arizona. The veto came after intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, who expressed their opposition to the bill. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the legislation, stating it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential." Similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. By vetoing the bill, Brewer protected the state's economy and ensured that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, would be treated with dignity and respect. END OF SUMMARY.
