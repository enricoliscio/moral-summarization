SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples based on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer recognized that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it solved, and that it did not address a specific concern related to religious liberty in Arizona. The bill was widely criticized by activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, who feared it would harm the state's economy. Brewer's decision was a significant victory for equality and fairness, as it prevented the legalization of discrimination against same-sex couples. The veto also sent a strong message that discrimination has no place in Arizona, and that all individuals deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

END OF SUMMARY.
