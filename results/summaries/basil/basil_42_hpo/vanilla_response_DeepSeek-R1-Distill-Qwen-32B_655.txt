Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill called SB 1062. The bill would have allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, effectively letting them discriminate against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill could create more problems than it solves and that she hasn't heard of any actual violations of religious liberty by business owners. 

The bill was passed by the state legislature but faced a lot of criticism. Both Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain asked Brewer to veto it. Major companies like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines also opposed it. There was concern about the upcoming Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, with the host committee saying the bill would harm the state's economic growth. 

Other states like Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine are also considering similar bills. There's a correction at the end about the Super Bowl location being Glendale, not Tempe.

So, the summary should include the key points: Brewer vetoing SB 1062, the bill's purpose, her reasons, opposition from senators and businesses, the Super Bowl concern, and other states' similar bills. I need to keep it under 200 words and present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by mentioning Brewer's veto, her reasoning, the opposition, the Super Bowl impact, and the other states. Make sure it's concise and captures all important details without being too wordy.
