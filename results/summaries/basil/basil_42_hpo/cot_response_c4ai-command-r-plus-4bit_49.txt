SUMMARY:
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively condoning discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer cited a lack of any present concerns regarding religious liberty violations in Arizona and the potential for the bill to create more problems than it solves. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism and opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The bill also raised concerns about the potential economic impact on Arizona, especially with the upcoming Super Bowl in Glendale in 2015. Similar controversial bills have been introduced in other states, sparking debate over the balance between religious freedom and discrimination. The veto sends a strong message against discriminatory legislation, but the controversy surrounding these bills highlights the ongoing struggle for LGBT rights in the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
