Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. She says the bill doesn't address a real issue and could cause more problems. The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the legislature but faced opposition from various groups, including major corporations and even Republican senators. The Super Bowl's host committee was worried about the economic impact. Similar bills are popping up in other states.

The author used specific morally charged words: veto, refuse, discriminate, create, liberty, violated, opposition, against, contrary, blow, pushing, discrimination, popping. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long, under 200 words.

I should start by mentioning Brewer's veto, the bill's purpose, her reasons, and the opposition. I'll include the impact on Arizona's economy, especially with the Super Bowl. Also, note the similar bills in other states. I need to make sure each key point is covered succinctly while using the moral terms.

Let me structure it: Brewer vetoes SB 1062, explaining it doesn't address real issues and could cause problems. The bill would allow refusal of service on religious grounds, leading to discrimination. She hasn't heard of religious liberty violations. There's opposition from senators, businesses, and the Super Bowl committee, worried about economic blow. Similar bills are appearing elsewhere.

I should make sure to include all the moral words where appropriate. For example, "veto," "refuse," "discriminate," "create," "liberty," "violated," "opposition," "against," "contrary," "blow," "pushing," "discrimination," "popping." 

Wait, "pushing" refers to the states introducing the bills, so I should include that. "Popping" is used to describe the emergence of similar bills. I'll need to weave these into the summary naturally.

Let me try to draft it:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed legislation allowing businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could enable discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer stated the bill didn't address current religious liberty issues and might create more problems. She cited no examples of violated religious rights. The bill faced opposition from lawmakers, corporations like Marriott and Apple, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, fearing economic repercussions. Similar discrimination bills are popping up in other states.

Wait, that's a bit short. Maybe add more details about the opposition and the Super Bowl impact.

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed SB 1062, which would have allowed businesses to refuse service on religious grounds, potentially enabling discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer argued the bill didn't address a specific religious liberty issue and could create more problems than it solved. She noted no instances of religious liberty being violated. The legislation faced opposition from Republican senators, major corporations, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, which warned it could deal a blow to the state's economy, especially with the upcoming Super Bowl. Similar bills promoting discrimination are popping up in other states.

That's better. It includes most of the moral terms and the key points. Let me check the word countâ€”it's around 100 words, so under 200. I think this captures the essence while preserving the moral framing.
