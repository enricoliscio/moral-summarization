SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to legally discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. The bill, known as SB 1062, faced intense criticism and opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, who argued that it would allow open discrimination and create more problems than it solved. Governor Brewer agreed, stating that the bill did not address any specific or present concerns related to religious liberty in Arizona and that there were no examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated. The bill had sparked controversy as it was seen as a way to legally discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. Similar bills have been introduced in other states, raising concerns about the potential for widespread discrimination. This veto sends a strong message against discriminatory legislation and in favor of protecting the rights of all citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
