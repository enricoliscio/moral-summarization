Alright, I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoing a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, effectively allowing discrimination against same-sex couples. She mentioned the bill didn't address a real issue and had more problems than solutions. There was opposition from various groups, including Republican senators, major corporations, and local businesses worried about the Super Bowl's impact. Similar bills are in other states.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects. The author is highlighting discrimination and the negative consequences of the bill. The opposition from businesses and politicians shows a stance against discrimination. I should make sure the summary reflects this moral perspective, emphasizing the potential for discrimination and the backlash against the bill.

I'll structure the summary to include Brewer's decision, her reasoning, the opposition, the Super Bowl concern, and mention other states. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure it's concise but covers all key points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill, SB 1062, which would have allowed businesses to refuse service to individuals, including same-sex couples, citing "religious freedom." Brewer argued the bill "had the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and noted it did not address a specific concern related to religious liberty. The bill faced widespread criticism from activists, lawmakers, and major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines, which opposed it. Local businesses in Phoenix were also concerned about the bill's impact on Arizona's economy, particularly with the Super Bowl set to be held in Glendale in 2015. Republican senators Jeff Flake and John McCain joined the opposition, urging Brewer to veto the legislation. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, sparking debates over discrimination and religious rights. Brewer's decision reflects a growing concern that such laws could legalize discrimination while harming economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
