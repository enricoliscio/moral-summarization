SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to legally discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. The bill, SB 1062, faced strong criticism and opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, who argued that it would allow open discrimination and create more problems than it solves. Governor Brewer agreed, stating that the bill did not address any specific or present concerns related to religious liberty in Arizona. The bill had been passed by the state legislature but was met with widespread condemnation, including from Arizona's Republican senators and major corporations. Businesses in the Phoenix area, particularly those involved with the upcoming 2015 Super Bowl in Glendale, Ariz., were worried about the potential economic impact of the bill. Similar bills that would allow discrimination against same-sex couples have been proposed in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. The veto sends a strong message against discrimination and in favor of protecting the rights of all citizens.
