SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively legalizing discrimination. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and that she had not heard of any instances where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The bill, SB 1062, had faced intense opposition from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also spoke out against the bill, warning that it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential." Similar bills aimed at allowing discrimination against same-sex couples have been popping up in other states, including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota, and Maine. By vetoing the bill, Brewer stood against discrimination and in favor of religious liberty and economic growth.
