SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to anyone on the grounds of "religious freedom," effectively condoning discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer stated that the bill could create more problems than it solves and that there are no current examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated in Arizona. The bill, SB 1062, faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, expressing concern about the potential economic blow to the state. Similar bills that push for discrimination against same-sex couples are popping up in other states as well, sparking controversy and opposition. Brewer's veto sends a strong message against discrimination and upholds the liberty and rights of all Arizonans.
END OF SUMMARY.
