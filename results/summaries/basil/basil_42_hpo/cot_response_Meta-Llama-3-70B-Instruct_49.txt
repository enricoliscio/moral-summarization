SUMMARY:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial bill that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer argued that the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve" and that she hadn't heard of any instance where business owners' religious liberty had been violated. The bill, known as SB 1062, faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and business interests, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating that it would "deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential" and run "contrary" to the goal of promoting tourism. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, but Arizona's veto marks a significant victory for those opposed to discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
