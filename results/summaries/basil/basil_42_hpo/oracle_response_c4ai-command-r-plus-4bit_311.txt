SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples on "religious freedom" grounds. Brewer stated that the bill had the potential to create more problems than it solved and that there was no present concern about religious liberty in Arizona. The bill, SB 1062, was passed by the state legislature but faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee also opposed the bill, stating that it would harm the state's economic growth potential. Similar bills have been popping up in other states, allowing discrimination against same-sex couples. Brewer's veto sends a strong message of opposition to such discriminatory practices. END OF SUMMARY.
