SUMMARY: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, a decision that opposes discrimination and protects religious liberty. The bill, SB 1062, faced strong opposition from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, who argued that it would create more problems than it solves and deal a blow to the state's economic growth potential. Gov. Brewer agreed, stating that the bill does not address any present concerns related to religious liberty in Arizona and that there are no examples of business owners' religious liberty being violated. Similar bills pushing discrimination against same-sex couples have been popping up in other states, but the veto in Arizona sends a clear message of opposition to such discriminatory practices. END OF SUMMARY.
