Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure, so I should follow that closely. First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. Let me read through the article again to pick those out.

The article talks about Governor Jan Brewer vetoing legislation that would allow businesses to refuse service based on religious freedom, which could lead to discrimination against same-sex couples. The key moral terms here are "veto," "discriminate," "religious freedom," "problems," "concern," "opposition," "criticism," "oppose," "oppression," "discrimination," "equality," "freedom," and "opportunity."

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should highlight Brewer's decision, the reasons behind it, the reactions from various groups, and the implications of the bill. I'll make sure to mention the opposition from senators, businesses, and the Super Bowl committee, as well as the broader context of similar bills in other states. This should capture the moral framing effectively.

**SUMMARY:**

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed legislation (SB 1062) that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples under "religious freedom" grounds, citing its potential to cause more problems than it aimed to solve. Brewer emphasized that the bill did not address any current concerns about religious liberty and that no examples of violated religious freedom by business owners had been presented. The bill faced intense criticism from activists, lawmakers, and businesses, including major corporations like Marriott, Apple, and American Airlines. Locally, businesses in Phoenix, particularly those involved in hosting the 2015 Super Bowl in Glendale, opposed the bill, fearing it would harm the state's economic growth. Similar bills have emerged in other states, sparking debates over discrimination and equality. Brewer's veto reflects a broader struggle between religious freedom and anti-discrimination principles.
