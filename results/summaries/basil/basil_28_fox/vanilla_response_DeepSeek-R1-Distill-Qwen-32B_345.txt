Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article describes the debate as feisty, with Biden being aggressive to make up for Obama's weak performance. I should note that Biden attacked Romney's 47% comment and Ryan's criticism of Obama's foreign policy.

I also need to mention the topics they discussed: economy, budget deficit, foreign policy, Medicare, and Iran's nuclear program. Highlighting how each candidate appealed to the middle class is important too.

The article mentions that Romney is gaining in polls, so I should include that as well. Finally, the upcoming debates are on the horizon, so that's a key point to end with.

I should structure the summary to cover these points clearly and succinctly, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
