Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Biden-Ryan vice presidential debate. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main points.

First, I'll read through the article to get the key events. The debate was feisty, with Biden being aggressive after Obama's weak debate. Biden attacked Romney's 47% comment and mocked Ryan. Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and the economy. They both argued over Libya, Medicare, taxes, and the deficit. Biden was more direct than Obama, and the debate is seen as important for the race.

I should structure the summary to include the main topics: the aggressive tone, Biden's attacks on Romney, Ryan's criticisms, the Libya issue, economic policies, and the impact on the race. Also, mention the upcoming debates and the shift in polls favoring Romney.

I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Make sure to highlight the contrast between Biden and Obama's debating styles. Also, note that the debate's outcome is uncertain but it's crucial for both campaigns.

Alright, let me put this together into a coherent summary.

SUMMARY:  
In a heated vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden aggressively attacked Paul Ryan, aiming to shift momentum after President Obama's underwhelming performance in the previous debate. Biden mocked Romney's "47 percent" remark, calling it offensive, while Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and economic record. The debate, centered on the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, saw both candidates challenging each other frequently. Biden criticized Romney for political opportunism regarding the Libya attack, while Ryan accused the administration of weakness and mismanagement. The debate also touched on Medicare, taxes, and Iran's nuclear program. Biden's assertive style contrasted with Obama's earlier performance, and the outcome could influence the race as Romney gains traction in polls.
