SUMMARY:

In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, trying to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's aggressive approach was a stark contrast to Obama's, as he repeatedly challenged Ryan's claims and projected a sense of urgency. Ryan, however, stood his ground, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy and presiding over a "shoddy recovery" at home. The debate turned feisty, with both candidates frequently interrupting each other and trading barbs over the economy, taxes, and Libya. Biden hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment, calling it "troubling" and saying he's "had it up to here" with such rhetoric. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "trying to blame" the Romney/Ryan ticket for making the Libya attack an issue. The debate's outcome remains to be seen, but it's clear that both sides are trying to gain the upper hand in the final stretch of the campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
