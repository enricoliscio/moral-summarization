SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Biden went on the offensive against Ryan, setting an aggressive tone and striving to hit the reset button after Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate. Biden attacked the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama lacked, notably hammering Romney over his "47 percent" comment and defending the middle class. Ryan accused the Obama administration of projecting weakness in foreign policy and overseeing a shoddy economic recovery. Biden interrupted Ryan frequently and let few points go unchallenged, at times bordering on overly aggressive. He defended the administration's handling of the Libya terror attack and criticized Romney for making a political statement on the night of the attack. Biden also charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors. Ryan warned of an impending debt crisis and claimed the Obama administration lacked leadership. The debate took on added importance as Biden sought to recapture momentum for the Obama campaign. The final presidential debates will be held on October 16 and 22.
END OF SUMMARY.
