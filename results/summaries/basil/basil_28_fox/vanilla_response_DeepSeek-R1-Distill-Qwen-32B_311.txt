Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article first.

The article describes the debate as a feisty affair where Biden was aggressive, trying to make up for Obama's poor performance. He attacked Romney's comments about the 47% and mocked Ryan's gaffes. Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy, especially regarding Libya, and accused the administration of a weak recovery. The debate covered topics like the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, with both candidates targeting the middle class. Biden defended the administration's actions in Libya, while Ryan accused them of mismanagement. The article also mentions that Romney is gaining in polls, and the next debates are upcoming.

I need to capture the key points: Biden's aggressive approach, the main issues discussed, the candidates' arguments, and the implications for the race. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and avoid too many details. I'll structure it to first mention Biden's strategy, then the topics debated, their arguments, and the outcome in terms of polls and upcoming events.

Let me start drafting the summary. Make sure to include that Biden was aggressive, the topics like economy, deficit, foreign policy, their arguments on Libya, the 47% comment, and the impact on the race with Romney gaining in polls. Also, mention the upcoming debates.

Wait, I should check the word count as I go. Let me write it out and then count the words to ensure it's within the limit. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

I think I have all the main points. Let me put it together concisely.
