SUMMARY:

In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, trying to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's aggressive tone was a stark contrast to Obama's, as he repeatedly attacked Ryan's statements, projecting a sense of urgency and concern for the middle class. Ryan, however, stood his ground, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The debate turned into a heated exchange, with both sides trying to blame each other for the country's economic woes and foreign policy troubles. Biden criticized Romney's comment about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes, calling it "troubling" and saying it's not what a real recovery looks like. Ryan, on the other hand, accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery, saying "this is not what a real recovery looks like." The debate ended with both sides claiming to be the true champions of the middle class.

END OF SUMMARY.
