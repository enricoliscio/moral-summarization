SUMMARY: In a feisty vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan went head-to-head, with Biden striving to hit the reset after President Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate. Biden took an aggressive tone, attacking the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not in his debate. He hammered Romney over his secretly videotaped "47 percent" comment, saying he's "had it up to here" with such remarks. Ryan accused the Obama administration of "projecting weakness" in foreign policy, particularly in its response to the Benghazi terror attack, and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. Biden went on the offensive on Libya, calling Ryan's criticism "malarkey." He also criticized Romney for making a "political statement" on the night of the attack. The debate veered across a range of topics, including Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, abortion, and the national debt. Ryan warned of an impending "debt crisis," accusing Obama of failing to provide leadership. The pressure was on Biden to recapture momentum for the Democrats, while Ryan aimed to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge in the polls. The final presidential debates will be held on October 16 and 22, with the race tightening and Romney gaining steam in battleground and national polls.
END OF SUMMARY.
