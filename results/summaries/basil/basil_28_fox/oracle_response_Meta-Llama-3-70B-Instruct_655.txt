SUMMARY:

In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, attempting to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's aggressive tone was marked by frequent interruptions, grins, and snickers, as he sought to project strength and leadership. Ryan, however, stood his ground, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in response to the Libya terror attack. The debate turned into a heated exchange, with both candidates trading blows on the economy, taxes, and Medicare. Biden hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment, saying it was an attack on the middle class. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "trying to blame" the Romney/Ryan ticket for making the Libya attack an issue. The debate highlighted the candidates' differing approaches to the economy, foreign policy, and leadership, with Biden promising to "protect" programs and Ryan vowing to "grow" the economy.
