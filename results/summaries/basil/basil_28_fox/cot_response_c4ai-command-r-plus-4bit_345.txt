SUMMARY:
Vice President Biden set an aggressive tone in the vice presidential debate, going on the offensive against Paul Ryan with disdainful attacks and interruptions. Biden was striving to hit the reset after President Obama lacked aggression in the first presidential debate, where he was too cold compared to Biden, who bordered on too hot. Biden blatantly hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly taped comments about the 47% of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes, calling it "malarkey." He also accused the Romney/Ryan ticket of presenting a shoddy recovery plan and eliminating the guarantee of Medicare. Ryan, in turn, criticized the Obama administration for its handling of the Libya terror attack and for their lack of leadership in addressing the deficit. Biden frequently pledged to protect programs for the middle class, while Ryan pledged to grow the economy for all. The debate veered across various topics, with Biden cautioning on Iran's nuclear program and abortion, and Ryan warning of an impending debt crisis. The pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum for the Obama ticket after Romney's surge in the polls following the first presidential debate. Biden's feisty performance was well-received by the Obama campaign, with the campaign manager calling him a "happy warrior" for the middle class.
