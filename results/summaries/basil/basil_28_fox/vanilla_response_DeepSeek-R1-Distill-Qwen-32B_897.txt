Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Biden-Ryan vice presidential debate. They provided the full article, so I need to read through it carefully. The main points seem to be the aggressive tone, the key issues discussed like the economy, foreign policy, and Medicare, and the implications for the election.

I should start by identifying the main events: Biden attacked Ryan over Romney's comments about the 47%, and Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy. They also debated the economy, deficits, and Medicare. The article mentions that Biden was more aggressive, trying to make up for Obama's weak debate performance.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key exchanges and the overall impact of the debate. It's important to mention that Romney is gaining in polls, and the upcoming debates. I should structure it to highlight the main points without getting too detailed.

I'll make sure to include both candidates' arguments, the issues they focused on, and the significance of the debate in the context of the election. Also, note the analysts' comments about Biden's approach compared to Obama's.

Finally, I'll wrap it up with the remaining debates and the potential shift in the race. Keeping it concise but comprehensive.

SUMMARY:  
In a feisty vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden aggressively attacked Paul Ryan, targeting the Romney-Ryan ticket and Mitt Romney's controversial comments about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. Biden mocked Romney's remarks, calling them "malarkey," while Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and economic record. The debate, centered on the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, saw both candidates spar over issues like Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, and the Benghazi attack. Biden accused Ryan of raising costs for seniors, while Ryan criticized Obama's handling of the debt crisis. The debate, seen as crucial after Obama's weak performance in the first presidential debate, highlighted Biden's aggressive style, contrasting with Obama's more measured approach. Romney has gained momentum in recent polls, with the next presidential debates scheduled for October 16 and 22. The outcome of the vice presidential debate could influence the race, as both campaigns prepare for the final stretch.  
END OF SUMMARY.
