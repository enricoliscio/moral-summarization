Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I have to make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. Biden was aggressive, trying to reset the campaign after Obama's weak performance. He attacked Ryan and Romney, especially over Romney's "47 percent" comment. Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy, particularly the Libya attack, and accused Biden of making gaffes. The debate was feisty, covering economy, deficit, foreign policy, Medicare, etc. Polls are showing Romney gaining, but Biden's performance was seen as more aggressive.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list: projecting, attack, recovery, deficit, strike, troubling, blamed, trying, blame, said, statement, eliminate, hand, turning, crisis, coming, get, leadership.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. For example, Biden "attacked" Ryan, Ryan "criticized" Obama's "projecting weakness," the Libya "strike," etc.

I'll start by mentioning the debate's intensity, Biden's aggression, and the key points they debated. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words in context without forcing them.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many of the specified words as possible.

SUMMARY:  
The vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan was intense, with Biden aggressively "attacking" Ryan and Romney, particularly over Romney's controversial "47 percent" comment. Biden "criticized" Romney's claim, stating it disrespected everyday Americans. Ryan "countered" by highlighting Biden's "gaffes" and "accused" Obama of "projecting weakness" in foreign policy, especially regarding the Libya "strike." Biden "retorted" by calling Ryan's claims "malarkey" and criticized Romney for making a "political statement" during the attack. The debate focused on the economy, "deficit," and foreign policy, with Biden "pledging" to protect middle-class programs and Ryan advocating for economic growth. Ryan "warned" of an impending "debt crisis," while Biden "charged" that Republican plans would "eliminate" Medicare guarantees. The feisty exchange reflected the high stakes, with Romney gaining momentum in polls. Biden's "feisty" performance aimed to "reset" the campaign after Obama's weak debate. END OF SUMMARY.
