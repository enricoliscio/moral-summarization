SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan clashed in a feisty vice presidential debate, with Biden taking an aggressive tone to counter Mitt Romney's surge in the polls. Biden repeatedly attacked Ryan, chuckling and smirking through many of his responses. He hammered Romney over his "47 percent" comment, saying it was an insult to middle-class Americans. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" on foreign policy, particularly in response to the Libya terror attack. The debate covered a range of topics, including the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy. Both candidates appealed to the middle class, with Biden pledging to protect federal programs and Ryan promising to grow the economy. The debate's outcome may not alter the course of the race, but it sets the stage for the next two presidential debates. Obama's campaign manager praised Biden's performance, calling him a "happy warrior" for the middle class.

END OF SUMMARY.
