Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words that the author used. The article is about the Vice Presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. The user has already provided a summary, but I should think through how to approach this task.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. The debate was intense, with Biden being more aggressive than Obama in the previous debate. They discussed the economy, Libya, taxes, Medicare, foreign policy, etc. The author used specific morally charged words like "projecting," "attack," "recovery," "deficit," etc. My goal is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by identifying the key events and the moral framing words associated with them. For example, Biden attacked Ryan's comments about the 47% and the Libya strike. Ryan accused Obama of projecting weakness. The economy and deficit were central topics. The article mentions the deficit, crisis, and leadership.

I'll structure the summary to cover the main points: Biden's aggressive approach, the topics discussed, the moral framing words, and the implications for the race. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while including the specified terms.

I should also ensure that the summary reflects the intensity of the debate and the contrast between Biden and Obama's styles. Including phrases like "feisty," "directness," and "uncharacteristically" can help convey the tone. I'll also mention the polls swinging in Romney's favor and the upcoming debates.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft a concise summary that includes the morally framed words and the key points from the article. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and contributes to the overall summary without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
The vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan was marked by an uncharacteristically feisty tone, with Biden setting an aggressive course to reset the campaign after Obama's lackluster performance. Biden directly attacked Romney's "47 percent" comment, calling it dismissive of everyday Americans, while Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy as projecting weakness, particularly regarding the Benghazi attack. The debate centered on the economy, deficit, and foreign policy, with both candidates appealing to the middle class. Biden criticized Romney's response to the Libya strike, calling it a political statement, while Ryan accused the administration of blaming a YouTube video and failing to lead. Biden also challenged Ryan's Medicare plan, calling it a voucher system that eliminates guarantees, while Ryan accused Obama of using Medicare as a piggy bank for Obamacare. The debate highlighted the growing intensity as Romney gains momentum in polls. END OF SUMMARY.
