Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to get the main points. The article is about the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. It seems like Biden was very aggressive, trying to make up for Obama's weak performance in the previous debate. They talked about the economy, Libya, taxes, and other issues. Biden attacked Romney's comments about the 47% of Americans not paying federal taxes, and Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy, especially regarding the Benghazi attack. The debate was intense, with both sides interrupting each other. The outcome might affect the race, and Romney's polls have been improving. There are more debates coming up, and the campaign is shifting strategy.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Biden's aggressive approach, the topics discussed, their main criticisms, the impact on the race, and the upcoming debates. I should make sure to mention the main issues like the economy, Benghazi, and Medicare. Also, note that Biden was more direct than Obama and that the debate was feisty. Finally, mention the poll shifts and the remaining debates.

Let me structure this. Start with Biden's approach, then the topics, their criticisms, the intensity of the debate, the impact on the race, and conclude with the remaining debates and campaign shifts. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary within the word limit.
