SUMMARY:

In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden took an aggressive tone against Paul Ryan, attempting to reset the campaign after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden repeatedly challenged Ryan's statements, often with a condescending tone, and hammered Mitt Romney over his "47 percent" comment. Ryan stood his ground, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" on foreign policy and presiding over a slow economic recovery. The debate covered a range of topics, including the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, with both candidates making appeals to the middle class. Biden's performance was seen as a marked improvement over Obama's, but it remains to be seen if it will alter the course of the race. With two more presidential debates scheduled, the campaign is expected to remain intense.

END OF SUMMARY.
