SUMMARY:
In a heated vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, adopting a feisty tone to counter President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's directness and aggressive stance were a stark contrast to Obama's cold demeanor, as he hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment, calling it "malarkey." Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the Libya terror attack. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and a sense of duress, as both candidates sought to score points. Biden pledged to protect the middle class, while Ryan vowed to grow the economy. The debate's outcome may alter the course of the race, with two more presidential debates to come. END OF SUMMARY.
