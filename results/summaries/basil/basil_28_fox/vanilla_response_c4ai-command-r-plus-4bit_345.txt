SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed over a range of topics, including the economy, Libya, and taxes. Biden took an aggressive stance, frequently interrupting and challenging Ryan's statements. Biden aimed to reset the campaign's momentum after President Obama's lackluster debate performance. He attacked Romney's "47 percent" comment and defended the administration's foreign policy decisions. Ryan criticized the Obama administration's handling of Libya and the weak economic recovery. Biden emphasized protecting the middle class, while Ryan pledged to grow the economy for all. The debate reflected the tightening race, with both candidates eager to challenge each other. Biden defended the administration's initial response to the Libya attack and criticized Romney's "political statement." He attacked the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, while Ryan accused the administration of raiding Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Ryan warned of an impending debt crisis and criticized Obama's leadership. The debate's feisty tone reflected the campaign's focus on swaying undecided voters. The final presidential debates will be held in October.
