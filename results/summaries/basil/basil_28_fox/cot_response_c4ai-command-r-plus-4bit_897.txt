SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden set an aggressive tone, going on the offensive and attacking his opponent, Paul Ryan, with disdain. Biden was determined to make up for President Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate, where he was too cold. Biden hammered Ryan on various issues, including Romney's "47 percent" comment and the administration's handling of the Libya terror attack. Ryan accused the Obama administration of projecting weakness and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. Biden interrupted Ryan frequently and chuckled through many of Ryan's responses, bordering on too hot in his delivery. The debate reflected the tightening race, with both candidates loath to give ground. Biden accused the Republican ticket of having "bad" ideas and eliminating the guarantee of Medicare, while Ryan warned of an impending debt crisis and a lack of leadership from the administration. The vice presidential debate took on added importance due to Obama's poor performance in the first debate, and Biden's feisty attitude aimed to recapture the momentum for the Democratic ticket. Biden's performance was deemed more aggressive than Obama's, and campaign manager Jim Messina praised him as a "happy warrior" for the middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
