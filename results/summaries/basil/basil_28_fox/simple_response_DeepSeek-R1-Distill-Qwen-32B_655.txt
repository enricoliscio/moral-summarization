Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. It highlights their aggressive tone, with Biden trying to make up for Obama's weak debate performance. 

I notice that Biden attacked Ryan's policies, especially the 47% comment, and emphasized his connection to everyday people. Ryan, on the other hand, criticized Obama's foreign policy and the economy. The article also mentions the impact of the debate on the polls, with Romney gaining some ground.

I should focus on the key moral arguments each presented. Biden framed the debate around helping the middle class and protecting programs, while Ryan criticized Obama's leadership and the economy. I'll need to include how each candidate presented their stance and the implications for the race.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the aggressive nature of the debate, Biden's efforts to reset the campaign, the main issues discussed, and the potential impact on the polls. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.
