SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed over various topics, including the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy. Biden set an aggressive tone, aiming to hit reset after Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate. He went on the offensive against Ryan, challenging him on various issues and defending the Obama administration's record. Biden emphasized his connection with the middle class and pledged to protect their interests. He also criticized Romney for his "47 percent" comment, portraying it as out of touch and insensitive. Ryan, meanwhile, accused the Obama administration of projecting weakness in foreign policy and mishandling the Libya terror attack. He also attacked their economic policies, claiming that the recovery has been shoddy and that their ideas are outdated. Ryan warned of an impending debt crisis and criticized the administration for a lack of leadership. The debate reflected the tightening race, with both candidates eager to gain the upper hand. Biden's performance was feisty and passionate, but at times bordered on overly aggressive, while Ryan remained composed and focused on his talking points. Both candidates tried to appeal to the middle class, with Biden pledging to protect federal programs and Ryan promising economic growth for all. The debate set the stage for the remaining presidential debates, with the Obama campaign aiming to recapture the momentum lost after the first debate.
