Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, around 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Biden-Ryan vice presidential debate. Biden was aggressive, contrasting Obama's performance. The debate covered economy, Libya, taxes, Medicare, foreign policy, etc. Biden attacked Romney's 47% comment and Ryan's policies, while Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and the administration's handling of the Libya attack.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article: projecting, attack, recovery, deficit, strike, troubling, blamed, trying, blame, said, statement, eliminate, hand, turning, crisis, coming, get, leadership.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning Biden's aggressive tone and his attacks on Romney. Then, I'll note Ryan's criticism of Obama's foreign policy and the administration's handling of the Libya strike. I'll include the deficit and the economy, as well as the Medicare debate. I'll make sure to use words like 'projecting weakness,' 'attack,''recovery,' 'deficit,' 'troubling,' 'blamed,''statement,' 'eliminate,' 'crisis,' and 'leadership.'

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key exchanges and the moral implications each candidate highlighted. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, covering the main topics and the moral framing without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the necessary words and keep it under 200 words. I'll check each sentence to see if it incorporates the moral terms effectively. Once done, I'll review to ensure all important points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
In a heated vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden aggressively attacked Paul Ryan, contrasting President Obama's lackluster performance in the previous debate. Biden directly criticized Mitt Romney's controversial "47 percent" comment, calling it offensive and dismissive of hardworking Americans. Ryan countered by accusing Obama of projecting weakness in foreign policy, particularly regarding the Libya strike, and criticized the administration's handling of the terror attack. Biden retorted, calling Ryan's claims "malarkey" and emphasizing the need for strong leadership. The debate also focused on the economy, budget deficit, and Medicare, with Biden accusing Ryan's plan of raising costs for seniors, while Ryan criticized Obama's policies for failing to address the debt crisis. Both candidates sparred over foreign policy, with Ryan criticizing Obama's response to the Benghazi attack and Biden defending the administration's intelligence. The feisty exchange highlighted the growing intensity of the race, with Romney gaining momentum in polls. Biden's aggressive tone aimed to recapture momentum for the Obama campaign, while Ryan sought to undermine the administration's credibility. The debate underscored the moral stakes of the election, with both sides accusing the other of failing to provide effective leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
