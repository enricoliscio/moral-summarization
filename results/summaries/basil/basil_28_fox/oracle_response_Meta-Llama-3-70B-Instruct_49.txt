SUMMARY:

In a fiercely contested vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden went on the attack against Paul Ryan, trying to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's aggressive tone was a stark contrast to Obama's, as he hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's secretly videotaped comment about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The debate turned feisty, with both candidates trading blows over the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy. Ryan accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery, while Biden pledged to protect programs in the federal budget. The debate's outcome remains to be seen, but it's clear that both candidates are trying to blame each other for the country's troubles. The next presidential debates will be crucial in determining the course of the race.

END OF SUMMARY.
