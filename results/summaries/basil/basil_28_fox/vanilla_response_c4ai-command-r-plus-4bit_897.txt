SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed over various topics, including the economy, foreign policy, and the budget deficit. Biden set an aggressive tone, trying to make up for President Obama's passive performance in the first presidential debate. He attacked Romney's "47 percent" comment and defended the administration's handling of the Libya terror attack. Ryan criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy and economic recovery efforts. Biden defended the administration's actions in Libya and attacked Romney's response to the attack. On Medicare, Biden accused the Romney-Ryan ticket of wanting to turn it into a voucher system, while Ryan countered that Obama used it to fund ObamaCare. Ryan warned of an impending debt crisis and accused Obama of failing to provide leadership. The vice presidential debate took on added importance due to Obama's poor performance in the first debate, with Biden aiming to recapture momentum for the Democrats. The final presidential debates will be held in mid-October, with the race tightening in Romney's favor.
END OF SUMMARY.
