Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. So, first, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about the Vice Presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. It highlights how Biden was aggressive, contrasting with Obama's previous performance. The moral framing here seems to be about the effectiveness of the candidates' strategies and the impact on the campaign.

I need to capture the main events: Biden's aggressive tactics, the topics they debated like the economy, foreign policy, Medicare, and the implications for the race. Also, the shift in polls towards Romney after the debate is important.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the moral aspects, like Biden's effort to reset the campaign momentum and Ryan's criticism of Obama's policies. I'll structure it to show the intensity of the debate and its potential impact on the election dynamics.

Let me start by outlining the key points: Biden's aggressive approach, the topics discussed, the poll shifts, and the implications for the campaign. Then, I'll weave these into a coherent summary, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: Vice President Biden aggressively dominated the vice presidential debate, contrasting with President Obama's lackluster performance in the previous debate. Biden directly attacked Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, focusing on Romney's controversial "47 percent" remark and Ryan's criticism of Obama's foreign policy. Biden's feisty demeanor, marked by interruptions and humor, stood in sharp contrast to Obama's calmness. Ryan, however, defended Romney's foreign policy and criticized Obama's economic record, calling the recovery "not real." The debate, which covered topics like Medicare, the economy, and foreign policy, was intense, with both candidates challenging each other's points. Biden's performance aimed to shift the campaign momentum, but Romney has gained traction in recent polls. The debate highlighted the candidates' differing approaches to governance and their efforts to appeal to the middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
