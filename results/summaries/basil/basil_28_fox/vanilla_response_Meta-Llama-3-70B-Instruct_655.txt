SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden took an aggressive tone in the vice presidential debate against Paul Ryan, attempting to reset the campaign after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, chuckled, and smirked during his responses. He hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment, saying it was an attack on his own family and neighbors. Ryan accused Obama of "projecting weakness" on foreign policy, particularly in response to the Libya terror attack. The debate covered topics such as the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, with both candidates making appeals to the middle class. Biden pledged to protect federal programs, while Ryan promised to grow the economy. The debate's outcome may not significantly alter the course of the race, with two more presidential debates scheduled. Polls have started to swing in Romney's favor, with the latest Fox News national poll showing Romney edging Obama 46% to 45%.

END OF SUMMARY.
