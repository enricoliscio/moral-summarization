Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user provided a list of those words, so I'll make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Biden-Ryan vice presidential debate, focusing on their aggressive exchanges. Biden was trying to reset the campaign after Obama's weak debate performance. He attacked Romney and Ryan, especially over Romney's "47 percent" comment. Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and the economic recovery.

I'll need to include words like "attack," "projecting," "recovery," "deficit," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key moments: Biden's aggression, the topics they debated, and the implications for the campaign.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start with the main event, then touch on each candidate's points, and end with the impact on the race. Make sure to use the moral words to frame the summary accurately.

SUMMARY:  
In a feisty vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden aggressively attacked Paul Ryan, aiming to reset the campaign after President Obama's lackluster debate performance. Biden directly criticized Mitt Romney's controversial "47 percent" comment, calling it offensive to everyday Americans, while Ryan accused Obama of projecting weakness in foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. The debate, centered on the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, saw both candidates clash over issues like Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, and abortion. Biden mocked Ryan's criticism of Obama's Libya response, calling it "malarkey," while Ryan accused the administration of turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare. The debate also highlighted the growing pressure on Biden to recapture momentum as Romney gains ground in polls. Analysts noted Biden's aggressive tone, contrasting it with Obama's cold performance a week prior. The clash underscored the moral stakes of the race, with both sides vying to demonstrate leadership and address the nation's challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
