SUMMARY:
In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, employing a direct and feisty tone to challenge the Romney/Ryan ticket. Biden's aggressive approach was a stark contrast to President Obama's lackluster performance in the previous debate. The vice president hammered Ryan on issues like the economy, Libya, and taxes, accusing Romney of making "political statements" and displaying "weakness" in his foreign policy. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" and presiding over a "shoddy recovery." The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and a sense of duress, with both candidates vying for the middle-class vote. In the end, Biden's "happy warrior" performance may have helped to recapture momentum for the Obama ticket. END OF SUMMARY.
