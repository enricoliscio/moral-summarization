Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user provided a list of those words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the vice presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. Biden was aggressive, trying to reset the momentum after Obama's weak debate performance. They argued over the economy, Libya, taxes, and foreign policy. Biden attacked Romney's "47 percent" comment, and Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and the economy.

I need to highlight the moral framing words: projecting, attack, recovery, deficit, strike, troubling, blamed, trying, blame, said, statement, eliminate, hand, turning, crisis, coming, get, leadership.

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Biden's aggressive approach, his attack on Romney's comments, Ryan's counterpoints about weakness and the economy. Mention the Libya strike and the criticism around that. Highlight the deficit and the crisis aspects. End with the impact on the race and the importance of the debate.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key exchanges and the moral implications each candidate presented. Make sure to include the morally charged words without forcing them in. Also, mention the polls shifting towards Romney and the upcoming debates.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary under 200 words, ensuring the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Vice President Biden aggressively attacked Paul Ryan during the vice presidential debate, aiming to reset the campaign momentum after President Obama's lackluster performance. Biden criticized Romney's "47 percent" comment, calling it offensive, while Ryan accused Obama of projecting weakness in foreign policy and presiding over a weak economic recovery. The debate centered on the economy, budget deficit, and foreign policy, with both candidates appealing to the middle class. Ryan criticized Obama's handling of the Libya strike, calling it troubling, while Biden retorted, dismissing Ryan's claims as malarkey. The debate also touched on Medicare, with Biden accusing Republicans of eliminating its guarantee, and Ryan countering that Obama's policies turned Medicare into a piggy bank. Biden mocked Romney's secretly videotaped comments, while Ryan criticized Obama for lacking leadership. The feisty exchange underscored the high stakes as Romney gains momentum in polls. The debate's intensity reflected the pressure on both candidates to sway the race, with the economy and deficit crisis looming large. END OF SUMMARY.
