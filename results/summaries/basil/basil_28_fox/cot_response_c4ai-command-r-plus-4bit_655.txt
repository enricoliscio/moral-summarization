SUMMARY:
Vice President Biden set an aggressive and offensive tone during the vice presidential debate, going on the offensive against Paul Ryan with disdain and aggression. Biden's performance was a stark contrast to President Obama's lackluster and cold demeanor during his first debate with Mitt Romney. Biden challenged Ryan directly and hammered him over his controversial "47 percent" comment, accusing Romney of making despicable statements about the American people. Ryan countered Biden's interruptions and interruptions by accusing the Obama administration of projecting weakness and presiding over a shoddy recovery. Biden dismissed Ryan's accusations as "malarkey" and blamed the Romney/Ryan ticket for making political statements in the wake of the Libya terror attack. The vice president also interrupted Ryan frequently, at one point suggesting he was under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground. On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket would eliminate guarantees and raise costs, while Ryan shot back that the Obama administration had stolen from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. The debate covered a range of topics, including Iran's nuclear program, abortion, and the national debt. Biden's feisty performance came as the Romney/Ryan ticket gained steam in the polls, with Romney edging Obama in recent national surveys. Obama's campaign manager described Biden as a "happy warrior" for the middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
