SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan clashed in a feisty vice presidential debate, with Biden taking an aggressive tone to counter Mitt Romney's surge in the polls. Biden repeatedly attacked Ryan, chuckling and smirking through many of his responses. He hammered Romney over his "47 percent" comment and defended the Obama administration's handling of the Libya terror attack. Ryan accused Obama of "projecting weakness" on foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. The debate covered topics from the economy to taxes to Medicare, with both candidates making frequent appeals to the middle class. The debate's outcome may not alter the course of the race, with two more presidential debates scheduled. Polls have started to swing in Romney's favor, and the Obama campaign has vowed to be more aggressive going forward.

END OF SUMMARY.
