SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offensive against Paul Ryan, attacking the Romney/Ryan ticket with disdain and interrupting Ryan frequently. Biden tried to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate, hammering Romney for his "47 percent" comment and defending the administration's foreign policy record. Ryan accused the Obama administration of projecting weakness in foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. He also blamed them for turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare and claimed they offer no solutions to the impending debt crisis. Biden, under pressure to make up for lost ground, defended the administration's actions in Libya and attacked Romney for making a political statement during the crisis. The debate was feisty, with both candidates interrupting each other and striving not to give ground. Biden's performance was more aggressive than Obama's, but it remains to be seen if it will alter the course of the race.
END OF SUMMARY.
