Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Biden-Ryan vice presidential debate. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I should focus on the key points and the tone regarding each candidate's performance.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main events. Biden was aggressive, challenging Ryan, and there were personal jabs, like Biden's mom and dad comment and Ryan mentioning Biden's gaffes. The economy, foreign policy, and Medicare were central topics. Biden attacked Romney's 47% comment, while Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy and the administration's handling of Libya.

I need to capture the intensity of the debate and how Biden aimed to reset the campaign momentum after Obama's poor debate. Also, the impact on the race, with Romney gaining in polls, and the upcoming debates.

I should structure the summary to highlight Biden's aggressive approach, the topics discussed, the personal attacks, and the implications for the campaign. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the required tokens.

Biden's assertiveness contrasted with Obama's previous performance, with analysts noting his "too hot" approach.
