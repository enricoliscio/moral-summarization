SUMMARY:

Vice President Biden took an aggressive tone in the vice presidential debate, attacking Paul Ryan on various issues such as the economy, Libya, and taxes. Biden's directness and passion were seen as a response to President Obama's lackluster performance in the previous debate. Ryan, on the other hand, accused Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy recovery. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and a feisty tone, with both candidates making appeals to the middle class. Biden hammered Ryan on Romney's "47 percent" comment, saying it was an insult to hardworking Americans. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of blaming others for the Libya terror attack. The debate's outcome may not alter the course of the race, but it sets the stage for the next presidential debates. Biden's performance was seen as a "happy warrior" for the middle class, while Ryan's criticism of Obama's foreign policy may have resonated with some voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
