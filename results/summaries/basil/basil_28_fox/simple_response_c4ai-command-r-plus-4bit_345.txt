SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed over various topics, including the economy, budget deficit, foreign policy, and abortion. Biden, aiming to reset the tone after Obama's passive performance in the first presidential debate, took an aggressive stance, often interrupting and mocking Ryan. He defended the Obama administration's handling of the Libya terror attack and criticized Romney for his "47 percent" comment. Ryan accused the Obama administration of projecting weakness in foreign policy and mishandling the Libya attack. Biden was seen as overly aggressive at times, while Ryan remained composed but faced criticism for interrupting. They debated Medicare, with Biden attacking the Romney-Ryan ticket's plan and Ryan claiming the Obama administration used Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Biden warned about the implications of the next president's Supreme Court picks on Roe v. Wade, while Ryan highlighted the need for leadership to address the deficit. The debate reflected the tightening race, with Romney gaining momentum in polls. Messina praised Biden as a "happy warrior" for the middle class.
