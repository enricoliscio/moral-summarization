SUMMARY:
In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, adopting an aggressive tone to counter Mitt Romney's surge in the polls. Biden's disdainful attacks on Ryan's responses were met with a feisty defense, as the two clashed over the economy, Libya, and taxes. Biden hammered Romney over his "47 percent" comment, calling it "malarkey" and saying it was an attack on his own family and neighbors. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" on foreign policy and presiding over a "shoddy" recovery. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and a sense of duress, as both candidates sought to score points. In the end, Biden emerged as a "happy warrior" for the middle class, but it remains to be seen if this will alter the course of the race. END OF SUMMARY.
