SUMMARY:
In a heated vice presidential debate, Joe Biden took an aggressive tone against Paul Ryan, trying to make up for President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's directness and feisty attitude were in stark contrast to Obama's cold demeanor, as he hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the Libya terror attack. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and a sense of duress, as both candidates tried to score points. Biden criticized Ryan's Medicare plan as "old" and "bad," while Ryan accused Obama of presiding over a "shoddy" recovery. The debate's outcome remains to be seen, but Biden's performance has been hailed as that of a "happy warrior" for the middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
