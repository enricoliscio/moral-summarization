Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Vice Presidential debate between Biden and Ryan. It describes the debate as feisty, with Biden being aggressive to make up for Obama's weak performance. Biden attacked Romney's comments about the 47% not paying taxes, calling them his mom and dad. Ryan criticized Obama's foreign policy, especially the Benghazi attack, and accused the administration of a weak recovery. The debate was intense, with both candidates interrupting each other. They discussed the economy, budget deficit, foreign policy, Medicare, Iran, and abortion. Biden was more direct than Obama, and the debate is seen as crucial since Romney is gaining in polls. The article ends with the upcoming debates.

Now, I need to summarize this in 200 words, keeping the moral framing. That means highlighting the moral stances each candidate took. Biden emphasized empathy and protecting the middle class, while Ryan criticized the administration's policies as ineffective and weakening the country. I should mention the key points like the 47% comment, Benghazi, Medicare, and the overall intensity of the debate. Also, note the impact on the race and the upcoming debates.

I'll structure the summary by starting with the debate's intensity, Biden's approach to counter Obama's weakness, the main issues they debated, their moral arguments, and the significance of the debate in the context of the polls and future debates.

Let me make sure to include all these elements concisely without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go.
