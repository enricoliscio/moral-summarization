SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan clashed in a feisty vice presidential debate, with Biden taking an aggressive tone and repeatedly challenging Ryan's statements. Biden criticized Ryan's running mate, Mitt Romney, for his comments about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes, saying they were his "mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors." Ryan accused Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the Libya terror attack. The debate covered a range of topics, including the economy, Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, and abortion. Biden and Ryan frequently interrupted each other, with Biden often chuckling and smirking during Ryan's responses. The debate was seen as crucial for the Obama campaign, which has been losing ground in the polls since the first presidential debate. The next presidential debates will be held on October 16 and 22.

END OF SUMMARY.
