SUMMARY:

In a spirited vice presidential debate, Joe Biden took an aggressive tone, attacking Paul Ryan on various issues, including the economy, Libya, and taxes. Biden's approach was a stark contrast to President Obama's lackluster performance in the previous debate. Biden hammered Ryan on Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment, saying it was an insult to his own family and neighbors. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and challenges from both sides, with each candidate appealing to the middle class. Biden pledged to protect federal programs, while Ryan promised to grow the economy for all. The debate's outcome may not alter the course of the race, but it sets the stage for the next two presidential debates.

END OF SUMMARY.
