SUMMARY:
In a heated vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden took an aggressive tone, launching a feisty attack on Paul Ryan. Biden's disdainful grins, guffaws, and snickers dominated the debate, as he sought to reset the campaign after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Ryan stood his ground, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Biden shot back, calling Ryan's claims "malarkey" and defending the administration's handling of the attack. The debate turned into a scrappy affair, with both candidates frequently interrupting each other. Biden hammered Romney over his secretly videotaped comment about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes, saying "these people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors." The debate's outcome may alter the course of the race, with two more presidential debates to come. END OF SUMMARY.
