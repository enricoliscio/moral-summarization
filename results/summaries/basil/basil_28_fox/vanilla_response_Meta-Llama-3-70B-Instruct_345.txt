SUMMARY:

Vice President Joe Biden took an aggressive tone in the vice presidential debate against Paul Ryan, aiming to make up for President Obama's lackluster performance in the previous debate. Biden frequently interrupted Ryan, chuckled, and smirked during his responses. He attacked the Romney/Ryan ticket on various issues, including the economy, Libya, and taxes. Ryan defended his ticket's stance on these issues, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" on foreign policy and presiding over a slow economic recovery. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and challenges from both sides. Biden emphasized his commitment to protecting middle-class programs, while Ryan pledged to grow the economy for everyone. The debate's outcome may not significantly alter the course of the race, but it could impact the momentum going into the next presidential debates on October 16 and 22.

END OF SUMMARY.
