SUMMARY: Vice President Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan faced off Thursday night in a feisty debate, with Biden going on the offensive in an attempt to blunt Mitt Romney's surge in the polls following the first presidential debate. Biden attacked Romney and Ryan on their tax policies and their foreign policy positions, while Ryan criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Libya terror attack and their economic policies. Biden defended the administration's record and pledged to protect the middle class, while Ryan promised to grow the economy and address the deficit. The debate covered a range of topics, including Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, abortion, and the budget deficit. Biden was aggressive and interrupted Ryan frequently, while Ryan remained composed and accused the Obama administration of weakness and a lack of leadership. The final two presidential debates will be held on October 16 and October 22, with the race tightening and Romney gaining ground in battleground and national polls.
END OF SUMMARY.
