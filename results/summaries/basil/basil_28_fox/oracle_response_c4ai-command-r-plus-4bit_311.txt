SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden went on the offensive against Paul Ryan, attempting to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate. Biden attacked the Romney/Ryan ticket, including Romney's controversial "47 percent" comment, while Ryan accused the Obama administration of "projecting weakness" in foreign policy and mishandling the Libya terror strike. Biden defended the administration's initial response, blaming the intelligence community. On domestic issues, Ryan criticized the administration's economic recovery efforts, while Biden pledged to protect middle-class programs. The debate reflected the tightening race, with both candidates interrupting each other and challenging each other's claims. Ryan warned of a looming debt crisis, accusing Obama of failing to provide leadership, while Biden attacked the Romney/Ryan Medicare plan as a voucher system that would eliminate guarantees. The pressure was on Biden to make up for lost ground, and his feisty performance may help the Obama campaign regain momentum.
END OF SUMMARY.
