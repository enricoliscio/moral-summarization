SUMMARY:

In a heated vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden went on the offense against Paul Ryan, trying to reset the tone after President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's aggressive tone was marked by disdainful attacks, grins, and interruptions, as he hammered Ryan on the economy, Libya, and taxes. He projected a sense of urgency, saying "I've had it up to here" with comments like Romney's "47 percent" remark. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The debate turned into a scrappy affair, with each candidate trying to blame the other for the country's troubles. Biden pledged to protect programs in the federal budget, while Ryan promised to grow the economy for everybody. The debate's outcome may not alter the course of the race, but it has set the stage for the next two presidential debates. END OF SUMMARY.
