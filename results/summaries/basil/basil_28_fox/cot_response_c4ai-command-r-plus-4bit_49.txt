SUMMARY: In a head-to-head proxy battle, Vice President Biden went on the offensive against Paul Ryan, setting an aggressive tone and blatantly striving to hit back after President Obama's lackluster performance in the first debate. Biden launched disdainful attacks on the Romney/Ryan ticket, hammering them over their comments about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. He also went after their foreign policy, accusing them of projecting weakness and blaming them for the handling of the Libya terror attack. On the economy, Biden charged that their plans would hurt the middle class and raise costs for future seniors. Ryan countered by accusing the Obama administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery and projecting weakness abroad. He warned that a debt crisis is coming and claimed that the President offers little more than speeches. The vice presidential debate was feisty and interrupted by both candidates, with Biden under duress to make up for lost ground. It remains to be seen if this debate will alter the course of the race, as Romney has gained steam in the polls following Obama's lacking performance in the first debate. Biden's performance, though offensive at times, may help recapture some of the lost momentum for the Obama ticket.
END OF SUMMARY.
