SUMMARY: In a heated vice presidential debate, Vice President Biden went on the offensive against his Republican rival, Paul Ryan, striving to reset the campaign's momentum after President Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate. Biden attacked the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama lacked, notably hammering them over their comments about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. Ryan accused the Obama administration of "projecting weakness" in foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. The debate reflected the tightening race, with both candidates eager to challenge each other on issues like the economy, the budget deficit, and foreign policy. Biden interrupted Ryan frequently, grinning and chuckling through many of Ryan's responses, leading some analysts to suggest he bordered on being too aggressive. Biden defended the administration's handling of the Libya strike, calling Ryan's criticism "malarkey." He also criticized Romney for making a "political statement" on the night of the attack. Ryan warned of a looming debt crisis and accused the administration of failing to provide leadership. The pressure was on Biden to recapture momentum for the Democrats, and his feisty performance was well-received by his party.
END OF SUMMARY.
