SUMMARY: In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed over a range of topics, including the economy, foreign policy, and abortion. Biden set an aggressive tone, attacking the Romney/Ryan ticket and striving to hit reset after President Obama's lackluster performance in the first presidential debate. Biden went on the offensive, disdainfully criticizing Romney's "47 percent" comment and projecting an image of himself as a defender of the middle class. He also blamed the Romney/Ryan ticket for trying to politicize the Libya attack, calling it "malarkey." Ryan, meanwhile, accused the Obama administration of projecting weakness in foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy economic recovery. He further criticized the administration for its handling of the Libya strike, blaming them for initially blaming the YouTube video. Ryan warned of a looming debt crisis and claimed that the Obama administration lacked leadership. The vice presidential debate reflected the tightening race, with each candidate loath to give ground and eager to recapture momentum. Biden's feisty performance aimed to blunt Romney's surge in the polls after the first debate.
END OF SUMMARY.
