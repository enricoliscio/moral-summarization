SUMMARY: Vice President Biden wasted no time on Thursday to go on the offensive against Paul Ryan, adopting a disdainful and aggressive tone that many Democrats felt was lacking in President Obama's debate against Mitt Romney. Biden chuckled, smirked, and frequently interrupted Ryan as he hammered away at the Romney/Ryan ticket, notably criticizing Romney's "47 percent" comment. Biden also accused Ryan of making warnings about a "weak" foreign policy and a shoddy economic recovery. Ryan, in turn, blamed the Obama administration for projecting weakness in foreign policy and mishandling the Libya terror attack. He also warned of a debt crisis and claimed the administration lacked leadership. The vice presidential debate was seen as crucial for both campaigns, with Biden aiming to recapture momentum for the Obama ticket and Ryan aiming to maintain Romney's surge in the polls. Biden interrupted Ryan repeatedly, challenging him on Medicare and accusing the Republican ticket of wanting to raise costs for future seniors. He also defended the administration's handling of the Libya attack and criticized Romney for making a political statement on the night of the attack. Ryan, meanwhile, stood his ground and accused Biden of being under duress to make up for lost ground. The debate reflected the tightening race, with both candidates frequently appealing to the middle class and neither willing to yield too much speech-time to the other. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, praised Biden's performance as that of a "happy warrior" for the middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
