SUMMARY:

In a fiery vice presidential debate, Joe Biden aggressively attacked Paul Ryan, trying to recover from President Obama's lackluster performance last week. Biden's tone was often disdainful, with frequent grins, guffaws, and interruptions. He hammered Ryan over Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comment, defending the dignity of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. Ryan shot back, accusing Obama of "projecting weakness" in his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the Libya terror attack. The debate was marked by frequent appeals to the middle class, with Biden pledging to protect programs and Ryan promising to grow the economy. The candidates clashed on issues like Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, and abortion. The debate's outcome may not alter the course of the race, but it sets the stage for the next two presidential debates.

END OF SUMMARY.
