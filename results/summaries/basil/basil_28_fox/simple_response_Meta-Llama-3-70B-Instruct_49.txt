SUMMARY:

Vice President Biden took an aggressive tone in the vice presidential debate, attacking Paul Ryan on various issues including the economy, Libya, and taxes. Biden's strategy was to hit back at the Romney/Ryan ticket, particularly on Romney's comment about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. Ryan, on the other hand, accused Obama of "projecting weakness" with his foreign policy and presiding over a shoddy recovery. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and challenges, with each candidate trying to appeal to the middle class. Biden's performance was seen as a marked improvement from Obama's lackluster debate last week, but it remains to be seen if it will alter the course of the race. The debate highlighted the importance of the next two presidential debates, which will focus on a range of issues and foreign policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
