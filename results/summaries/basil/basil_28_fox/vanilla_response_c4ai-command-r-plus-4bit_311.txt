SUMMARY: In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan clashed over various topics, including the economy, Libya, and taxes. Biden set an aggressive tone, seeking to make up for President Obama's passive performance in the first presidential debate. Biden attacked the Romney/Ryan ticket and defended the middle class, while Ryan criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy and economic recovery efforts. They also discussed Medicare, Iran's nuclear program, abortion, and the deficit. Biden hammered Romney over his "47 percent" comment, while Ryan accused Obama of projecting weakness abroad. Analysts noted that Biden's performance bordered on overly aggressive at times. The debate took on added importance due to Romney's surge in polls following the first presidential debate. The final presidential debates are scheduled for October 16 and 22.
