Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used the word "said," so I need to include that.

First, I'll read the article carefully. Trump announced he's not moderating the Newsmax debate. He said it would be the most watched and substantive. He's pulling out because he doesn't want to give up his right to run as an independent, which the Republican Party was asking. Earlier, he hinted at running as a Republican. Only Gingrich and Santorum were attending, others declined. There was public ridicule for his decision to moderate and endorse someone. Trump hinted at canceling but said it was still on as late as Monday.

Now, I need to summarize this in under 200 words, using "said" as the morally framed word. I should keep the key points: Trump's decision, reasons, the candidates' responses, public reaction, and his indecision.

I'll start with Trump announcing he's not moderating, using "said." Then mention the reasons, the candidates attending, public ridicule, and his indecision. Make sure the summary is concise and includes all important points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27. "I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate," Trump said in a statement. He claimed the event would have been the most watched, substantive, and interesting debate but withdrew because he did not want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate," which he accused the Republican Party of demanding. Trump had initially partnered with Newsmax to host the forum with remaining Republican presidential candidates, but only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate at the debate. Despite earlier claims that the forum was still on, Trump hinted at canceling it as the days passed. END OF SUMMARY.
