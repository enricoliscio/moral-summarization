SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a December 27th debate, citing concerns that the Republican Party would require him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. Trump had initially partnered with Newsmax to host a forum with remaining Republican presidential candidates, but a majority of them declined to participate. The decision to cancel the debate comes after Trump faced public ridicule for his intention to moderate and endorse a candidate of his choice. Despite initially confirming the debate, Trump began to waver and eventually pulled out. This move raises questions about Trump's commitment to the democratic process and his willingness to prioritize his own interests over the needs of the public.

END OF SUMMARY.
