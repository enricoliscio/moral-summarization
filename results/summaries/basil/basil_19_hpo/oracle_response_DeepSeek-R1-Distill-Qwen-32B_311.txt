Okay, so I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used the word "said" as a morally framed word, so I should keep that in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump announced he's pulling out of a debate he was supposed to moderate for Newsmax. He said he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do. He initially partnered with Newsmax but then many candidates declined to attend, only Gingrich and Santorum were coming. Trump also faced public ridicule for his decision and his endorsement pledge. He hinted at canceling the debate but said it was still on as late as Monday night.

I need to make sure to include the word "said" where it was used in the original text. I'll structure the summary to include Trump's announcement, his reason, the candidates' responses, the ridicule, and his indecision about canceling the debate.

I'll start by stating Trump's decision, use "said" when he explains his reason, mention the candidates not attending, the public reaction, and his vacillation. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft that: Trump announced he's not moderating the Newsmax debate, citing not wanting to give up his independent candidacy. He said the debate would be the most watched and substantive. Most candidates weren't attending, only Gingrich and Santorum. He faced ridicule and criticism for his endorsement plan. Trump wavered on canceling but said it was still happening until he pulled out.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the morally framed word "said." I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. It seems to be concise enough.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced that he is no longer moderating the Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, stating that he did not want to "give up his right to run as an independent candidate." Trump said the debate would have been the most watched, substantive, and interesting, but he ended it due to concerns about his candidacy. The announcement came after most Republican presidential candidates declined to attend, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum planning to appear. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse a candidate during the debate. Despite earlier claims that the forum was still on, Trump ultimately decided to cancel it. END OF SUMMARY.
