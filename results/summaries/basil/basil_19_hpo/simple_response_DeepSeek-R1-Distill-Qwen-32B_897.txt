Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump pulling out of the Newsmax debate. The user wants a concise summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Trump announced he's not moderating the debate, citing his desire to run as an independent. He thought it would be the most watched and substantive. He mentioned the Republican Party was asking him to give up his independent candidacy if he wanted to moderate. 

He initially partnered with Newsmax, but most candidates didn't show up except Gingrich and Santorum. He faced public ridicule and was considering canceling the debate, but was still saying it would happen as late as Monday night.

Now, I need to capture all this in under 200 words, focusing on Trump's decision, the reasons, the candidates' reactions, and the public's response. I should highlight the moral aspect, like his stance on independence versus party pressure.

I'll structure it: Trump's announcement, his reasons, the initial partnership, candidates' refusal, public ridicule, his wavering, and the final cancellation. Make sure it's clear and concise, preserving the original's tone and framing.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, remember to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".
