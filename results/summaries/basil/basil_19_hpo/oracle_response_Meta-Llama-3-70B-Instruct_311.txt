Donald Trump announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Dec. 27th debate, claiming it would have been the most watched and substantive debate. He said he didn't want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate,‚Äù which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do if he wanted to moderate the debate. Trump initially said he was partnering with Newsmax to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates, but a majority of them refused to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to appear. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially saying the forum would take place, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling the debate and finally announced its cancellation. Trump said he was ending the debate, a decision that was met with criticism and ridicule.
