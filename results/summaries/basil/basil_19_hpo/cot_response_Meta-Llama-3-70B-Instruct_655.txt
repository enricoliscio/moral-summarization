SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, citing that he did not want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate". This decision comes after a majority of the Republican presidential candidates declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Trump's initial decision to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, and he was criticized for his plan to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially confirming the debate, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling it, and has now officially pulled out. This move is seen as a selfish decision, prioritizing his own interests over the opportunity to host a potentially "most watched" and "most substantive" debate. END OF SUMMARY.
