SUMMARY: 
Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican debate he had planned for December 27th with conservative magazine Newsmax. Trump cited his desire to preserve his right to run as an independent candidate as the reason for canceling the debate, claiming the Republican Party was asking him to give up that right if he wished to moderate. This announcement comes just eleven days after Trump's initial pledge to partner with Newsmax, during which time he also attracted ridicule for his loud claims about considering a Republican run and his plan to endorse the candidate he liked best. Despite initially claiming that the forum was still taking place as late as Monday night, Trump had begun making noises about canceling the event as more and more candidates declined to appear, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum honoring their pledge to do so.
END OF SUMMARY.
