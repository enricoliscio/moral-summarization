SUMMARY: Donald Trump has said that he will not be moderating the Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27th. In a statement, Trump said, "I have decided not to be the moderator...I believe this would not only have been the most watched debate, but also the most substantive and interesting debate." Trump cited his refusal to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate" as the reason for canceling the debate, claiming the Republican Party was asking him to make this sacrifice. This announcement comes just eleven days after Trump initially proposed the debate, during which time a majority of candidates made clear they would not attend, and Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and endorse a candidate. Despite hints at canceling, Trump maintained as recently as Monday night that the forum was still taking place.
END OF SUMMARY.
