SUMMARY:
Donald Trump announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, claiming it would have been the most watched and substantive debate. However, he "said" he didn't want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate,‚Äù which he alleged the Republican Party was asking him to do. This comes after a majority of the Republican presidential candidates refused to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to appear. Trump's decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, and he was criticized for his pledge to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially saying the forum was still on, Trump eventually canceled it, citing his desire to preserve his independence. Throughout the ordeal, Trump's words and actions were met with skepticism and criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
