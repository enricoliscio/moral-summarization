Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I remember that morally framed words often carry a positive or negative connotation related to values, ethics, or principles. I'll go through the article and pick out words that fit that description.

Looking at the article, words like "pulling out," "moderator," "watched," "substantive," "interesting," "right," "independent," "pledging," "pledge," "endorse," "noise," "cancel," "ridicule," "noises," "canceling," "pledging," "pledge," "endorse," "noise," "cancel," "ridicule," "noises," "canceling," "pledging," "pledge," "endorse," "noise," "cancel," "ridicule." Wait, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral connotation. I need to be careful to only include those that do.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the key points: Trump announcing he's pulling out of the debate, his reasons, the candidates' reactions, and the public's response.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and includes the main events without adding extra information. I'll structure it to mention Trump's decision, his reasons, the candidates' reluctance, the public ridicule, and the eventual cancellation.

Finally, I'll make sure to format the response correctly, starting with STEP 1 listing the morally framed words and then the summary after the specified tokens.

### SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump announced he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, citing his desire to retain the right to run as an independent candidate. He claimed the Republican Party was pressuring him to give up this option if he wanted to moderate. Trump had initially partnered with Newsmax to host the forum, but most Republican candidates declined to attend, leaving only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse a candidate during the debate. Despite earlier assurances the debate would proceed, Trump signaled he might cancel it, and ultimately, he pulled out. END OF SUMMARY.
