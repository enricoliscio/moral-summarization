SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate on December 27th. Trump claimed that he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate, which he believed the Republican Party was asking him to do in order to moderate the debate. The announcement comes just 11 days after Trump initially said he was partnering with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. However, a majority of the candidates made it clear they would not attend, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially saying the forum was still on, Trump ultimately cancelled it.

END OF SUMMARY.
