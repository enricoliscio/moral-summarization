Alright, I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump pulling out of his own debate. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Trump announced on Tuesday that he's not going to moderate the Newsmax debate scheduled for December 27th. He said he decided not to be the moderator because he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. The Republican Party was apparently asking him to do that if he wanted to moderate. Earlier, he had mentioned considering running as a Republican, which caused some waves.

He initially partnered with Newsmax to host the debate with remaining Republican candidates, but most of them didn't show up. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were coming. Trump also faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate during the debate.

As time went on, Trump hinted at canceling the debate, but as late as Monday night, he was still saying it would happen. So, now he's pulling out.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump's announcement, his reason (running as independent), the initial partnership with Newsmax, the lack of candidates, public reaction, and the change in plans.

I'll structure it to first state that Trump is pulling out, why, when he announced it, the initial plan, the candidates' response, the ridicule, and the change in decision.

Let me make sure I don't miss any key details. Also, keep the language clear and concise.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.
