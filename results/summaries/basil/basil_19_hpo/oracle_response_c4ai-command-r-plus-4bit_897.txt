SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is backing out of moderating the Dec. 27th debate, stating that he did not want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate." This reason was given in a said statement, where Trump also claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to make this sacrifice if he wanted to moderate the debate. The announcement came just eleven days after the initial declaration of Trump's partnership with Newsmax to host the forum. The majority of invited Republican presidential candidates declined the invitation, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging their attendance. Trump's decision to moderate the debate, as well as his pledge to endorse a favorite candidate, attracted public ridicule. Despite hinting at a possible cancellation, Trump maintained as recently as Monday night that the forum would take place. However, he ultimately chose to cancel the event, citing his desire to maintain his political options open.
END OF SUMMARY.
