SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, citing that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. Trump claimed that this debate would have been the most watched, substantive, and interesting debate. However, his decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, and many Republican candidates made it clear they would not attend. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledged to appear. Trump's initial decision to moderate was loud and clear, but as the days went on, he began making noises about possibly canceling the debate. In the end, Trump's decision to pull out was seen as a usual move, given the controversy surrounding his role as moderator. END OF SUMMARY.
