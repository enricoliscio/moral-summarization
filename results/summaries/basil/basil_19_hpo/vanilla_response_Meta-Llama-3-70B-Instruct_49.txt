SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he is withdrawing from moderating the December 27th Newsmax debate. He claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate in order to moderate the debate. Trump initially partnered with Newsmax to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates, but a majority of the candidates declined to participate. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend. Trump's decision to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, and he had previously hinted at possibly canceling the event. Despite saying on Monday night that the forum was still on, Trump ultimately decided to pull out. Trump believes that his moderation would have made the debate the most watched and substantive one.

END OF SUMMARY.
