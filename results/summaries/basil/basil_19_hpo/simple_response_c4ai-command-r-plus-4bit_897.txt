SUMMARY: In a move that can only be described as morally bankrupt and cowardly, Donald Trump has backed out of hosting a Republican debate, citing his desire to maintain his "right to run as an independent candidate." This is a blatant lie, as the real reason is clear: he knew that the majority of candidates would not attend, and he would be exposed as a fraudulent moderator with no support. Despite initially claiming he would endorse the best candidate, Trump's true colors are showing as those of a bully and a hypocrite. His decision to cancel the debate is a betrayal of his pledge to the American people and an insult to the democratic process. Trump's actions show that he is unfit to be associated with the important task of selecting the next leader of the free world. His behavior is a stain on the integrity of the Republican Party and the office of the President. Trump's announcement is a relief to those who value substance over spectacle and an embarrassment to those who value integrity and courage in their leaders. 

END OF SUMMARY.
