*ridicule*
*share*

SUMMARY: 
Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate he had organized for Dec. 27, stating that he did not want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate," which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do. Trump's announcement comes just eleven days after he initially proposed the debate, during which time he attracted a *share* of public *ridicule* and a majority of candidates made clear they would not attend. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledged to appear. Trump had also promised to endorse his favorite candidate at the debate, a promise that drew additional *ridicule*. Despite hinting in recent days that he might cancel the event, Trump was still saying as late as Monday night that the forum was taking place.
END OF SUMMARY.
