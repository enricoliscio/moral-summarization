SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a December 27th debate, citing concerns that the Republican Party would require him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. This decision comes just 11 days after Trump announced his partnership with Newsmax to host the forum with remaining Republican presidential candidates. Despite initial enthusiasm, a majority of candidates declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum committing to attend. Trump's decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, particularly his pledge to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate. The moral of the story is that Trump's ego and self-interest ultimately prevailed, leading him to prioritize his own ambitions over his commitment to hosting a potentially "most watched" and "most substantive" debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
