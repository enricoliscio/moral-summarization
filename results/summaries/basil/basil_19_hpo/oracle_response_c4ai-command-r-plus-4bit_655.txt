SUMMARY: In a statement Tuesday, Donald Trump announced his decision not to moderate the Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, citing his refusal to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate" as demanded by the Republican Party. This announcement comes just eleven days after Trump's initial partnership announcement with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. The decision attracted public ridicule, with most candidates opting out and only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to attend. Trump's indecision about the debate's cancellation was evident until the last minute, as he continued to assert the forum would take place as recently as Monday night. Trump's statement said that the debate would have been the most watched and interesting, but his potential candidacy as an independent took precedence.
END OF SUMMARY.
