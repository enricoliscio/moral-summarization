SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he is withdrawing from moderating the December 27th Newsmax debate, citing the Republican Party's alleged demand that he give up his right to run as an independent candidate. This comes just 11 days after Trump initially partnered with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. However, most candidates declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, particularly his pledge to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially confirming the debate, Trump began hinting at cancellation and has now officially pulled out. This decision raises questions about Trump's commitment to the democratic process and his willingness to put personal interests above the public's right to informed debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
