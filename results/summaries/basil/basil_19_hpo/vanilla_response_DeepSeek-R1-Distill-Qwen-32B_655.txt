Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Donald Trump pulling out of his own debate. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Trump announced on Tuesday that he's pulling out of the Dec. 27th debate. He was supposed to moderate it for Newsmax. He said he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do if he wanted to moderate. Earlier, he had considered running as a Republican, which caused some waves.

The announcement came just 11 days after he partnered with Newsmax to host the forum. Most candidates didn't show up, only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were coming. Trump also faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate at the debate. He hinted at canceling the debate but was still saying it would happen as late as Monday night.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump pulling out, the reason about running as an independent, the initial partnership with Newsmax, the lack of candidates, public ridicule, and his indecision before canceling.

I should structure it clearly, maybe start with the announcement, then the reason, followed by the initial setup, the candidates' response, the ridicule, and his indecision. Keep it concise and make sure it flows well.

Let me draft it step by step. First sentence: Trump announces withdrawal from the debate. Then why: because of the Republican Party's condition. Then mention the initial partnership and the few candidates. Then the public reaction and his indecision.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Also, make sure to end with the required tokens.
