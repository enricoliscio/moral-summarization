Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump pulling out of his own debate. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author used, especially focusing on the word "said." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump announced he's not moderating the Newsmax debate, citing he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent. He thought it would be the most watched and substantive debate. The article also mentions that most candidates didn't show up, only Gingrich and Santorum were attending. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision and his endorsement plan. He was wavering about canceling the debate but still said it was happening until he pulled out.

Now, I need to make sure to include the word "said" as it's the morally framed word here. I should structure the summary to include Trump's statements and the implications of his actions. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

I'll start by stating Trump's decision, then his reason, followed by the initial plans and the candidates' responses. Then mention the ridicule and his wavering, ending with the cancellation. I'll make sure to use "said" where appropriate.

Let me draft that: Trump said he's not moderating because he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent. He thought it would be the most watched and substantive. Most candidates didn't attend, only Gingrich and Santorum. He faced ridicule and was unsure, but said it was happening until he canceled.

I think that covers all the points and uses "said" as needed. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Looks good.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is withdrawing from moderating the Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, stating, "I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate." Trump claimed the event would have been the most watched, substantive, and interesting, but said he was ending it to preserve his right to run as an independent candidate. Earlier, he had partnered with the conservative magazine to host a forum with remaining Republican presidential candidates, though most declined to attend, leaving only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate at the debate. Despite earlier statements that the forum was proceeding, Trump began signaling potential cancellation, though he insisted it would happen as late as Monday night. END OF SUMMARY.
