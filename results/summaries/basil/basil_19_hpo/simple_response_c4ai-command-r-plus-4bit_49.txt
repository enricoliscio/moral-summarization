SUMMARY: With his typical arrogance and grandstanding, Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, citing his desire to keep his options open to run as an independent candidate as the reason. This is a shameful display of narcissism and a slap in the face to the American people, as Trump prioritizes his own ego and desire for attention over the democratic process. The fact that he even considered running for president as a joke and a publicity stunt is disrespectful and dangerous, and now he has the gall to back out of a debate that he himself proposed. It is clear that Trump has no regard for the integrity of the political process and is only interested in generating media attention and boosting his own brand. This behavior is a blight on our political system and a disservice to the American people, who deserve better than a billionaire bully manipulating the system for his own amusement. End of summary.
END OF SUMMARY.
