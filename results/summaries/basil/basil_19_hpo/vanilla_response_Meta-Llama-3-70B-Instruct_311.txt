SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the December 27th Newsmax debate, citing that he did not want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. Trump claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to do so if he wanted to moderate the debate. The announcement comes just 11 days after Trump initially said he was partnering with Newsmax to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. However, a majority of the candidates had already declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's decision to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, and he had also pledged to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially saying the forum was still on, Trump ultimately decided to cancel it.

END OF SUMMARY.
