SUMMARY:

Donald Trump announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, citing that he did not want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate," which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do. Trump initially said he was partnering with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates, but a majority of them refused to participate. Trump's decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, and he was criticized for his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially saying the forum was still on, Trump eventually cancelled it, claiming it would have been the "most watched debate" and the "most substantive and interesting debate." Trump's actions were met with skepticism, with many questioning his motives and sincerity.

END OF SUMMARY.
