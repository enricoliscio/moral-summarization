SUMMARY: With characteristic bravado, Donald Trump has said he is withdrawing from moderating a Republican debate scheduled for Dec. 27th. Trump claimed his debate would have been the "most watched," as well as the "most substantive and interesting." However, his announcement came on the heels of several Republican candidates saying they would not attend, and public ridicule for his decision to moderate and endorse a candidate. Trump cited his refusal to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate" as the reason for canceling, blaming the Republican Party for asking him to do so, and alluding to his earlier claims about a potential run as a Republican. Despite earlier hints that he might cancel, as recently as Monday night Trump said the forum was still on. 

END OF SUMMARY.
