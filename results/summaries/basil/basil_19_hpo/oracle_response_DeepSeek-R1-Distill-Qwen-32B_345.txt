Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I need to make sure I preserve the moral framing from the original text. The key here is to keep the morally framed words like "said" as much as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump announced he's not moderating the Newsmax debate anymore. He claims it's because he doesn't want to give up his right to run as an independent, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do. He initially partnered with Newsmax, but most candidates didn't show up, only Gingrich and Santorum. There was public ridicule, and Trump was considering canceling the debate but was still saying it was happening as late as Monday night.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: Trump's decision, his reason about running as an independent, the candidates' lack of participation, public reaction, and his indecision about the debate's status.

I'll start by stating Trump's announcement, then his reason, mention the initial partnership and the candidates' reluctance, the public ridicule, and his vacillation on the debate. I'll make sure to use "said" where appropriate to maintain the moral framing.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be concise but include all necessary details. Also, I should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to summarizing the facts with the moral words preserved.

Putting it all together, I'll structure it so each sentence flows logically, covering each main point without exceeding the word limit. I'll ensure that the summary starts with the key decision and then explains the reasons and consequences.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include all the essential elements while keeping it within 200 words and preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced that he is withdrawing from moderating the Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, stating that he did not want to "give up his right to run as an independent candidate." Trump claimed the Republican Party was pressuring him to renounce his independent candidacy if he wanted to moderate the debate. He initially partnered with Newsmax to host the forum, but most Republican candidates declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum confirming their attendance. Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate at the debate. Despite earlier assurances that the forum would proceed, Trump hinted at canceling it in the days leading up to the event. END OF SUMMARY.
