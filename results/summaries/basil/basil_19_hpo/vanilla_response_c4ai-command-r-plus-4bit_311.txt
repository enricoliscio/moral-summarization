SUMMARY: Former President Donald Trump announced he would no longer moderate a Republican debate scheduled for December 27th, citing his desire to keep his options open to run as an independent candidate. This decision comes just eleven days after he initially proposed the idea, during which time he faced public ridicule and an increasing number of candidates declined the invitation. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum had pledged to attend, while other candidates made clear they would not be turning up. Trump had also stated that he would endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate, which further complicated matters. Despite hinting at canceling the debate, Trump maintained that it was still happening as recently as the night before his announcement.

END OF SUMMARY.
