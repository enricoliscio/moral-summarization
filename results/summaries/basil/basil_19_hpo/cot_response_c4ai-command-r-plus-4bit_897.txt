SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican debate he had planned for Dec. 27, claiming that he did not want to "give up his right" to run as an independent candidate, a condition he says the Republican Party was imposing. This announcement comes just eleven days after Trump's initial plan, which caused a stir and attracted much ridicule for his very loud musings about a potential Republican run earlier in the year. Most of the candidates had already refused to participate, and in the days leading up to his announcement, Trump hinted at cancellation but still insisted the forum would take place as late as Monday night. 

END OF SUMMARY.
