Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate. They provided the article, so I need to read through it and extract the key points.

First, the main event is Trump announcing he's not moderating the Newsmax debate on Dec. 27th. He said he decided this because he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do. That's interesting because earlier he was considering running as a Republican.

Next, the announcement came just 11 days after he partnered with Newsmax. But most Republican candidates didn't show up, except Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump was also facing public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate. He was wavering about canceling the debate, even saying it was still on as late as Monday night.

So, the summary should include Trump's withdrawal, his reason related to running as an independent, the partnership with Newsmax, the lack of candidate participation, public reaction, and his indecision leading up to the cancellation.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to cover all these points clearly.
