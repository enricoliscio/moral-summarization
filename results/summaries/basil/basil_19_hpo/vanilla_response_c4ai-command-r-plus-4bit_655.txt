SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Newsmax debate scheduled for December 27th. In a statement, Trump claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate if he wanted to moderate the debate. The announcement comes just eleven days after Trump initially proposed hosting the debate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's decision to moderate the debate and his pledge to endorse a candidate were met with public ridicule, and most Republican candidates made it clear they would not attend. Trump had hinted at canceling the debate in recent days but insisted as recently as Monday night that it was still taking place. 

END OF SUMMARY.
