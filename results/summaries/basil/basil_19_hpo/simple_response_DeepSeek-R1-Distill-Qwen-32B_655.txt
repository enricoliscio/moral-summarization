Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate he was supposed to moderate. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it needs to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump announced he's not moderating the Newsmax debate, citing his desire to run as an independent candidate. He initially partnered with Newsmax but then decided to cancel because the Republican Party might have asked him to forgo running independently if he moderated. Most candidates didn't show up except Gingrich and Santorum. Trump also faced public ridicule for his decision and his endorsement plan.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements. I'll start by stating Trump's decision to pull out, mention the reason about running as an independent, the initial partnership, the candidates' lack of participation, and the public reaction. I should keep it clear and within the word limit.

I also need to include the moral framing, which in this case is Trump's justification for his decision based on his political independence. It's important to highlight that he felt the Republican Party was pressuring him, which adds context to his decision.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: his announcement, reason, initial plans, candidates' response, and public reaction. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and covers the essential points without unnecessary details. 

After drafting, I'll review to ensure it's under 200 words and that the moral aspect is clear. I think that's all. Time to put it together.
