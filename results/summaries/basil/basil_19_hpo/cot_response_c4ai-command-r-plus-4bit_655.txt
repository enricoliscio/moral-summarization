STEP 1:
* Ridicule
* Substantive

SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has sparked controversy by withdrawing from moderating a Republican presidential debate he had organized for Dec. 27th. Trump claimed that his decision was due to the Republican Party asking him to "give up [his] right to run as an independent candidate" if he wanted to moderate. This announcement comes just eleven days after Trump proposed the debate, during which time most candidates made clear they would not attend and Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse a candidate. Despite initially insisting the forum would take place, Trump ultimately canceled it, citing his desire to preserve his political options. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum had pledged to appear at the debate, which Trump believed would have been the most watched and "substantive" event of its kind.
END OF SUMMARY.
