Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate he was supposed to moderate. The user also wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

First, Trump announced he's pulling out of the Newsmax debate on December 27th. He said he wouldn't moderate because he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do if he wanted to moderate. Earlier, he had hinted at running as a Republican, which caused some waves.

The article mentions that Trump initially partnered with Newsmax to host the debate with remaining Republican candidates, but most of them didn't show up except for Gingrich and Santorum. Also, Trump faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his plan to endorse a candidate at the debate. He was considering canceling the debate but was still saying it would happen as late as Monday night.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The author seems critical of Trump's decision, pointing out the lack of support from candidates and the public ridicule. The moral angle is that Trump's actions were self-serving and not in the interest of the Republican Party or the debate's success.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's self-interest, the lack of support, and the negative reactions. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start with Trump's announcement, his reason, the lack of candidate support, public ridicule, and his indecision before canceling. End with the implication that his decision was self-serving.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating the Newsmax debate, citing concerns over his independence as a potential candidate. He claimed the Republican Party was pressuring him to give up his right to run independently if he moderated. Trump initially partnered with Newsmax to host the debate, but only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend, with most candidates opting out. His decision to moderate and endorse a candidate drew public ridicule, and despite earlier assurances the debate would proceed, Trump ultimately canceled it. His actions reflect a focus on personal interests over the party's unity, drawing criticism for prioritizing his political ambitions over the event's success. END OF SUMMARY.
