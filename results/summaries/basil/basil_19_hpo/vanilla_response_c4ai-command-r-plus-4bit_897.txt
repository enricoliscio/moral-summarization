SUMMARY: Former President Donald Trump announced he would not moderate a Republican debate scheduled for Dec. 27, citing his desire to keep his options open to run as an independent candidate. The announcement came eleven days after Trump initially proposed hosting the debate in partnership with conservative magazine Newsmax. The event faced immediate pushback, with most Republican candidates refusing to attend and public ridicule for Trump's role as moderator and his plan to endorse a candidate at the debate. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum had pledged to attend. Trump had hinted at canceling the event in recent days, but as recently as Monday night, he indicated it was still happening. 

END OF SUMMARY.
