SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced that he will not be moderating the Newsmax debate scheduled for December 27th. In a statement, Trump claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate if he wanted to moderate the debate. Trump's decision comes just eleven days after he initially announced his plan to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. The announcement follows public ridicule for Trump's decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse a candidate at the debate. Additionally, the majority of candidates had made clear they would not attend, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Trump had hinted at possibly canceling the debate in recent days, but as late as Monday night, he was still indicating that the forum would take place.

END OF SUMMARY.
