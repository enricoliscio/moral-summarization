SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he is withdrawing as the moderator of the Newsmax debate, scheduled for December 27th. Trump claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate in order to moderate the debate. Despite initially partnering with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates, a majority of the candidates declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's decision to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, and he had previously hinted at possibly canceling the event. Trump believed that the debate would have been the most watched and substantive, but ultimately decided to pull out. 

END OF SUMMARY.
