SUMMARY: Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is withdrawing from moderating the Dec. 27th debate, stating that he did not want to "give up his right" to run as an independent candidate, a condition he claimed the Republican Party was imposing. This decision comes just eleven days after Trump's initial announcement of partnering with Newsmax to host a forum, during which he also said he would endorse the candidate he liked best. Trump's announcement attracted public ridicule, with most candidates opting out of the debate, except Gingrich and Santorum. Trump's initial statement caused waves, as did his subsequent suggestion that he might cancel the debate, only to later say it was still taking place as recently as Monday night.
END OF SUMMARY.
