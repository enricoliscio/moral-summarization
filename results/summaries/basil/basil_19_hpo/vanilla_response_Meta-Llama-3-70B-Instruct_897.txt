SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has announced that he is withdrawing from moderating the Newsmax debate on December 27th. Trump claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate in exchange for moderating the debate. The announcement comes just 11 days after Trump initially partnered with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. However, a majority of the candidates had already declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's decision to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, and he had previously hinted at possibly canceling the event. Despite stating on Monday night that the forum was still on, Trump has now officially pulled out.

END OF SUMMARY.
