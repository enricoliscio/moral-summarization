SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the December 27th debate, citing that the Republican Party was asking him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. This decision comes after a majority of the remaining Republican presidential candidates made it clear they would not participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Trump's initial decision to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, and his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate was seen as unusual. As the days went on, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling the debate, and finally decided to pull out, ending the possibility of what he claimed would have been the most watched and substantive debate. Trump's loud claims of considering running as a Republican earlier in the year added to the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
