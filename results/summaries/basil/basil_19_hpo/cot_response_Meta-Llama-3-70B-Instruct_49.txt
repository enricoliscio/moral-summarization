SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, citing that he didn't want to "give up my right" to run as an independent candidate. Trump claimed that the Republican Party was asking him to do so if he wanted to moderate the debate. This decision comes after a majority of the remaining Republican presidential candidates refused to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Trump's initial decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, and his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate was seen as unusual. As the days went on, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling the debate, and ultimately decided to do so. This move is seen as a loud reversal of his initial stance. END OF SUMMARY.
