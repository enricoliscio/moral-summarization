SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the December 27th debate, claiming it would have been the most "substantive and interesting" debate. However, he decided to end the debate to preserve his "right" to run as an independent candidate, which he believed the Republican Party was asking him to give up. This decision comes after a majority of the Republican presidential candidates refused to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum "pledging" to appear. Trump's initial decision to moderate was met with "ridicule" from the public, and his promise to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate was seen as questionable. In the end, Trump's "loud" claims of considering a run as a Republican earlier in the year seem to have come back to haunt him. END OF SUMMARY.
