Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Okay, the article says Trump announced he's not moderating the Newsmax debate on Dec. 27th. He gave a statement saying he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do. He initially partnered with Newsmax to host the debate, but most candidates didn't show up except Gingrich and Santorum. He faced public ridicule for moderating and endorsing a candidate, and he hinted at canceling the debate but said it was still on as late as Monday night.

So, the main points are: Trump withdrew as moderator, citing wanting to remain an independent candidate. The debate was initially planned but most candidates didn't attend. He faced criticism and rumors of cancellation. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words.

I should start with Trump's announcement, the reason, the initial partnership, the lack of candidates, public reaction, and the change in plans. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me structure it: Trump announces withdrawal, reason, initial partnership, candidates' response, public ridicule, and his indecision leading to cancellation.

That should cover all the key points without going into too much detail.
