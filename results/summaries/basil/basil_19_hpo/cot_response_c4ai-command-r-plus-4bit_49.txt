STEP 1:
*waves*
*ridicule*
*endorse*

SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican debate he had planned for Dec. 27th, citing his refusal to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate." This condition was reportedly imposed by the Republican Party in exchange for Trump's moderating the debate. The announcement comes just eleven days after Trump initially said he was partnering with Newsmax to host the forum, and after most candidates made clear they would not attend, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Trump's decision to moderate the debate attracted *ridicule*, as did his pledge to *endorse* whichever candidate he liked best. Despite hinting at a possible cancellation in recent days, Trump had insisted as late as Monday night that the forum was still taking place.
END OF SUMMARY.
