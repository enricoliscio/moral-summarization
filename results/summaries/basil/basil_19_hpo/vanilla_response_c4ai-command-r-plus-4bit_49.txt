SUMMARY: Donald Trump has announced that he will no longer moderate the Newsmax debate scheduled for December 27th. In a statement, Trump claimed that he did not want to "give up his right to run as an independent candidate," which he alleged the Republican Party was asking him to do if he chose to moderate. This announcement comes just eleven days after Trump initially proposed the debate, during which time a majority of the Republican presidential candidates declined to participate. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum had pledged to attend. Trump's decision to moderate the debate, as well as his plan to endorse a candidate, drew public ridicule and speculation that he might cancel the event. Despite this, Trump continued to assert that the forum would take place as recently as the night before his announcement. 

END OF SUMMARY.
