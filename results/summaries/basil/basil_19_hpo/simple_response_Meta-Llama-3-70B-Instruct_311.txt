SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate, citing concerns that his involvement would require him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. This decision comes after a majority of the candidates refused to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's initial announcement to moderate the debate was met with ridicule, and his pledge to endorse the candidate he liked best at the debate was seen as inappropriate. Despite initially confirming the debate would take place, Trump began to hint at canceling it and has now officially pulled out. This move raises questions about Trump's commitment to the Republican Party and his willingness to prioritize his own interests over the needs of the party and its candidates.

END OF SUMMARY.
