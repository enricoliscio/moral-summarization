SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Dec. 27th debate, claiming he didn't want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate," which he said the Republican Party was asking him to do. Trump initially said he was partnering with Newsmax to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates, but a majority of them refused to participate. Trump's decision to moderate was met with public ridicule, and he also faced criticism for his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate. Despite initially saying the forum was still on, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling it, and has now officially pulled out. Trump claimed that his debate would have been the most watched and substantive, but it seems his own ambitions took priority. 
END OF SUMMARY.
