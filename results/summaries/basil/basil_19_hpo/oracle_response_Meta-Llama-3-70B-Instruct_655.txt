SUMMARY:

Donald Trump announced that he is pulling out of moderating the Newsmax debate, claiming it would have been the most watched and substantive debate. However, he "said" he ended the debate because he didn't want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate,‚Äù which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do. Trump initially partnered with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates, but a majority of them refused to participate. Trump also faced public ridicule for his decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best. Despite initially confirming the debate, Trump began hinting at canceling it, and finally made the announcement.

END OF SUMMARY.
