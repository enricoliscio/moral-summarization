SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a December 27th debate, citing concerns that the Republican Party would require him to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. This decision comes after a majority of Republican presidential candidates declined to participate, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to attend. Trump's initial announcement to moderate the debate was met with public ridicule, particularly regarding his intention to endorse a candidate at the forum. Despite initial assurances that the debate would proceed, Trump began to hint at canceling the event. His withdrawal raises questions about his commitment to the democratic process and his willingness to prioritize personal interests over the public's need for informed discussion.

END OF SUMMARY.
