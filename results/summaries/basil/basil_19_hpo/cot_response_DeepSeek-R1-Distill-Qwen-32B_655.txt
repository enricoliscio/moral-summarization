Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Donald Trump pulling out of a debate and specific instructions on how to process it.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. The user mentioned two steps: step one is to list these words, each on a new line with a *. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "moderator," "substantive," "independent," "pledging," "ridicule," "canceling," and "pledge" come to mind because they relate to responsibility, substance, independence, commitment, criticism, and promises.

Next, I have to summarize the article while preserving these moral frames. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include those words. I should structure it to highlight Trump's decision, his reasons, the candidates' reactions, the public's response, and the eventual cancellation.

I also need to make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll need to ensure that the morally framed words are included naturally within the summary without making it forced.

I should double-check that I've captured all the key points: Trump's initial announcement, his reasons related to running as an independent, the lack of candidates attending, the public ridicule, and the eventual cancellation despite earlier statements. Including the moral words will help maintain the author's framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's clear, concise, and meets the word limit. I'll also ensure that the formatting instructions are followed correctly, with each step clearly marked and the summary properly enclosed.

**STEP 1:**  
* moderator  
* substantive  
* independent  
* pledged  
* ridicule  
* canceling  
* pledge  

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump announced he is pulling out of moderating a Newsmax debate, citing concerns about his right to run as an independent candidate. He claimed the Republican Party was pressuring him to give up this right if he wanted to moderate the event. Trump initially partnered with Newsmax to host the debate but faced backlash as most Republican candidates declined to attend, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear. Public ridicule followed Trump's decision to moderate and his pledge to endorse a candidate during the debate. Despite earlier statements that the forum was still happening, Trump ultimately decided to cancel it, citing his desire to preserve his independence. END OF SUMMARY.
