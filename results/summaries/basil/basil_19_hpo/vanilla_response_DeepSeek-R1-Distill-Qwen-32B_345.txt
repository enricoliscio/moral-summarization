Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump pulling out of the Newsmax debate. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Trump announced he's not going to moderate the Dec. 27th debate. He said he didn't want to give up his right to run as an independent candidate, which the Republican Party was supposedly asking him to do. Earlier, he had partnered with Newsmax to host the debate with remaining Republican candidates, but most of them declined to attend except Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.

He also faced public ridicule for both moderating and planning to endorse a candidate. Over time, he hinted at canceling the debate, but as late as Monday, he was still saying it would happen. Now, he's pulling out.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump's withdrawal, his reason about running as an independent, the initial partnership, the candidates' lack of attendance, public reaction, and his vacillation before canceling.

Let me structure this clearly, making sure each key point is covered concisely.
