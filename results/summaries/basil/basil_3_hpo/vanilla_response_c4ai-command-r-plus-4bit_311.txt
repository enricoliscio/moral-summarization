SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was recently involved in an altercation with an anonymous reporter, where he was asked if he supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appeared irritated and grabbed the reporter's wrist, demanding to know his identity. The incident has sparked criticism and discussion about the new brand of anonymous inflammatory assault interviews and the increasing unpopularity of the Democratic Party's agenda. Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, stating that he regrets his reaction and will work to promote civil public discourse. The incident has also raised questions about the role of anonymous protesters and the potential involvement of political parties in such incidents. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse accused Republicans of being behind the incident, stating that it was a "Republican party tracking operation."
