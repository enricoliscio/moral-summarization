Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter who asked him about supporting Obama's agenda. He got angry, grabbed the camera, and apologized later. 

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "unreceptive," "provocative," "assault," "defensible," "jerk," "ambush," "gotcha," "hatchet job," "apologized," "respect," "civil," "unjustified," "integrity," "accountability," "credibility," "chaos," "decorum," "dignity," "public trust," "duty," "ethics," "fairness," "transparency," "respectful," "constructive," "democracy," "civility," "dignity," and "public trust." These words carry moral judgments about the actions and the situation.

Now, for the summary. I need to include these words where appropriate. The key points are the incident, the reactions, the claims of a Republican operation, the apology, and the broader implications on media and politics.

I'll structure the summary by starting with the incident, then the reactions from different sides, the DNC's claim, the apology, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to convey the author's perspective.

Let me draft it step by step. First, describe the incident with "unreceptive" and "provocative." Then, mention the physical response as "assault." Include that the reporter was anonymous, which ties into "ambush." The DNC claims it's a "gotcha" or "hatchet job." Etheridge apologizes, showing "respect" and "civil" discourse. The broader context is about "integrity" and "accountability," with implications for "credibility" and "chaos" in politics.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear. Let me check the word count as I go. I need to make sure each sentence flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced.

Wait, did I include all the key points? The incident, the DNC's accusation, the apology, and the implications on media and politics. Yes. Now, let me make sure the summary isn't too long. I think it's within the limit. 

I should also ensure that the summary reflects the author's framing, which seems critical of both the Congressman's actions and the anonymous interview tactics. So, I'll balance the moral judgment on both sides without taking a side, just presenting the facts with the included moral terms.

**SUMMARY:**

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) responded with "unreceptive" behavior when an anonymous reporter posed a "provocative" question about his support for the Obama agenda. The incident involved Etheridge physically "assaulting" the reporter's camera and questioning the reporter's identity, raising concerns about the "ambush" nature of the interview. The DNC accused the event of being a "gotcha" operation, possibly a "hatchet job" by Republicans. Etheridge later apologized, expressing regret and emphasizing his commitment to "respect" and "civil" discourse. The incident highlights issues of "integrity" and "accountability" in politics, with broader implications for media conduct and public "credibility." The event underscores the challenges of maintaining "decorum" and "dignity" in an increasingly polarized political landscape, while also prompting questions about the "public trust" and the "duty" of elected officials to engage respectfully with the media. END OF SUMMARY.
