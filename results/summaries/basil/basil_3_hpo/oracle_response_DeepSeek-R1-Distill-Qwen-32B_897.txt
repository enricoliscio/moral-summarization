Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting aggressively to an anonymous reporter. The reporter asked if he supported Obama's agenda, and Etheridge grabbed the camera and the reporter. The author uses words like "grabbed," "knocking," and "assault" to describe his actions, which have negative connotations.

Next, there's commentary from Big Government and Mediaite. Big Government criticizes Democrats for their policies, using terms like "captured," "forced," "recession," and "maxed out" to frame their argument negatively. Mediaite questions the anonymous nature of the interview, using words like "blurred," "hidden," and "operation" to suggest it's a Republican setup.

The DNC's statement accuses it of being a Republican "hatchet job," using terms like "motives matter" and "tracking operation." Etheridge later apologizes, acknowledging his poor response and the need for civil discourse.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally charged words as possible without losing the essence. I'll structure it to cover Etheridge's actions, the reactions from both sides, and his apology, all while using the specified terms.

SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on video grabbing and knocking a student reporter's camera after being asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The encounter, described as an "assault," sparked debate over the motives behind the anonymous interview, with some suggesting it was part of a Republican "operation" to discredit Democrats. Critics argued that the progressive left had "captured" Congress, leading to unpopular policies and economic challenges like a potential recession. Mediaite questioned the credibility of the anonymous "students," noting the blurred faces and hidden identities, suggesting it might be a "gotcha" tactic. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse accused the Republican Party of orchestrating the incident, calling it a "hatchet job." Etheridge later apologized, acknowledging his "poor response" and vowing to promote civil discourse, despite the "partisan" nature of the encounter. END OF SUMMARY.
