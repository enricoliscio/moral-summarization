SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) has apologized for his inappropriate behavior after a video surfaced showing him grabbing and knocking down the camera of an anonymous reporter who asked if he supported "the Obama agenda." The congressman's response has sparked criticism, with some arguing that his actions were defensive against a new brand of anonymous and inflammatory "journalism." The incident has raised questions about the ethics of ambush interviews and the blurring of lines between political parties and the media. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) spokesman, Brad Woodhouse, accused Republicans of being behind this "tracking operation," criticizing their lack of transparency. The congressman's apology acknowledged his regret and reaffirmed his commitment to promoting civil public discourse, despite intrusive and partisan politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
