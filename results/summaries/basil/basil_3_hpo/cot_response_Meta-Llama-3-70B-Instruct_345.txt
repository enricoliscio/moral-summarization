SUMMARY:
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera reacting angrily to a question about his support for the Obama agenda. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the reporter's wrist and asking for identification, after which he knocks the camera to the ground. The incident has sparked controversy, with some calling it an "assault" and others arguing that the reporter's inflammatory question and anonymous identity provoked the reaction. The congressman has since apologized for his "combative" behavior, saying it was a "poor response" and promising to promote a "civil public discourse." The incident has also raised questions about the role of anonymous and partisan reporting in politics, with some arguing that it is a "hatchet job" and others seeing it as a necessary check on power.
