Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter. He grabbed the camera and seemed aggressive. The reporter was a student, but the video showed their face blurred. The article also includes different perspectives from Big Government, Mediaite, and the DNC.

I should identify the key points: the incident, the reactions from different sources, and the apologies. The moral framing is important. Big Government is critical of Democrats, Mediaite questions the reporter's methods, and the DNC accuses Republicans.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by describing the incident, then the reactions from each side, and end with the apology. I'll use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Let me make sure I capture all the main points without bias, just presenting the facts and the different moral viewpoints. I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on video reacting aggressively to an anonymous reporter who asked him if he fully supported the Obama agenda. Etheridge grabbed the reporter's camera, knocked it to the ground, and demanded the reporter identify himself. The reporter claimed to be a student, but his face was blurred in the video. Big Government criticized Etheridge's actions, framing them as a sign of a "progressive left" in Congress causing public frustration. Mediaite questioned the reporter's methods, suggesting the interview was provocative and possibly part of a new brand of "journalism." The DNC accused the incident of being a Republican "hatchet job," pointing to the blurred face and hidden identity of the reporter. Etheridge later apologized, stating he regretted his reaction and committed to promoting civil discourse. The incident highlights tensions between political figures and anonymous reporters, with differing moral perspectives on the behavior of both sides. END OF SUMMARY.
