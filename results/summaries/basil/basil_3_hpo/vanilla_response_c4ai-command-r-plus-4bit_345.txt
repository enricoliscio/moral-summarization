SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was involved in an altercation with an anonymous reporter who asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." Etheridge appeared irritated, knocked the camera to the ground, and grabbed the reporter's wrist, demanding to know his identity. The incident sparked discussions on the state of journalism and the increasing unpopularity of Democratic policies. While some criticized Etheridge's response, others pointed out the problems with anonymous inflammatory interviews. The DNC and Etheridge himself issued apologies for the incident.

END OF SUMMARY.
