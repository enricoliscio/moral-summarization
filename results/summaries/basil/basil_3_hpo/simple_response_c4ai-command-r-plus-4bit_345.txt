SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was involved in an altercation with an anonymous reporter, in which he grabbed the reporter's wrist and knocked their camera to the ground. The incident has raised questions about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory interviewing and the increasing unpopularity of the Democratic Party's agenda. Etheridge's actions have been criticized, with some arguing that he came off as a jerk. However, it has also been noted that the new brand of "journalism" involving ambush interviews may have contributed to his aggressive response. The incident has sparked discussions about the role of media training for public figures and the potential impact on political discourse. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse defended Etheridge, suggesting that the incident was a Republican Party hatchet job intended to undermine the Democratic Party. Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that his response was inappropriate and pledging to promote civil public discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
