Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, who had an incident with an anonymous reporter. The reporter, claiming to be a student, asked Etheridge if he fully supported the Obama agenda. Etheridge got upset, grabbed the camera, and physically restrained the reporter. The video shows him being aggressive.

The article then includes commentary from Big Government, which criticizes Democrats for their policies and links Etheridge's actions to a breakdown in governance. They suggest this is part of a trend where the progressive left has made the government ineffective.

Mediaite responds by questioning the reporter's methods, suggesting the anonymous approach might have provoked Etheridge. They note that the video's source is questionable, with blurred faces and an account name that sounds fake.

The DNC's spokesman accuses Republicans of setting up the interview, pointing out the anonymous nature as a sign of a "hatchet job." Finally, Etheridge apologizes, admitting his poor reaction and vowing to promote civil discourse.

So, the moral framing here is that both sides are at fault. The reporter's anonymous and provocative approach is seen as manipulative, while Etheridge's reaction is uncivil. The article also touches on the broader issue of partisanship and how it affects public discourse.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the incident, the reactions, and the moral implications. I should mention the anonymous reporter, Etheridge's actions, the criticism from both sides, and the apology. I should also note the DNC's accusation and Mediaite's take on the reporter's methods.

Let me structure it: start with the incident, then the immediate reactions, the DNC's response, Mediaite's perspective, and conclude with Etheridge's apology and the broader moral issue of civility versus provocation.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the original article's tone, which seems to suggest that both the reporter and Etheridge are at fault, and that the incident highlights a problem with political discourse.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key points without getting bogged down in details. Make sure to include all the important elements: the question asked, Etheridge's reaction, the commentary from Big Government, Mediaite's response, the DNC's accusation, and the apology.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and captures all the necessary points with the moral framing intact.
