Alright, so I'm trying to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter. He grabbed the reporter's camera and wrist after being asked about supporting Obama's agenda. The reporter claimed to be a student, but the video shows their face blurred. 

I need to make sure I capture the key points: who, what, when, where, why. So, Etheridge is the congressman, he was interviewed by an anonymous reporter, he got physical, the reporter's identity was hidden, and there's some political context.

The user wants a summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I should include that the reporter was anonymous, the congressman's reaction, the blur in the video, the DNC's suspicion it's a Republican operation, and Etheridge's apology.

I should also mention the debate about the nature of the interview and the political implications. Maybe touch on how both sides are reactingâ€”Democrats accusing Republicans, and critics questioning the reporter's credibility.

I'll structure it by starting with the incident, then the details about the reporter's anonymity, the DNC's statement, Etheridge's apology, and the broader implications. Keeping each part brief to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft that and check the word count to make sure it's under 200.
