SUMMARY:

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera grabbing and knocking a camera to the ground when asked by an anonymous reporter if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman's reaction was deemed unacceptable, with some arguing that it was a result of the "hard, progressive left" that has "captured" the Democrat majority in Congress, leading to unpopular legislation and a looming recession. The reporter's anonymity and provocative question were also criticized, with some calling it a "Republican party tracking operation." Etheridge later apologized for his behavior, stating that he "deeply and profoundly regret[s]" his reaction and will work to "promote a civil public discourse." The incident has sparked debate about the state of politics, with some arguing that it's a sign of things to come in a "long, hot summer" of partisan politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
