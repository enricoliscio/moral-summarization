SUMMARY:

A video has surfaced showing Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) grabbing a self-identified "student" who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appears irritated, knocks the camera to the ground, and demands to know who the reporter is. The cameraman claims they are just students working on a project. The incident has sparked debate about the increasingly unpopular Democratic agenda and the tactics of anonymous reporters. While Etheridge's actions are partially defensible, his physical response was unjustified. The incident raises questions about the motives of the reporters, who remain anonymous and have their faces blurred out in the video. The DNC has responded, calling the incident a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it was uncivil and unjustified.

END OF SUMMARY.
