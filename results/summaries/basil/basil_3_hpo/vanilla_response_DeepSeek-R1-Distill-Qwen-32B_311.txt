Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The main event is Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter. He grabbed the reporter and knocked the camera. The reporter was asking if he fully supported Obama's agenda. The article mentions that the reporter's face was blurred, suggesting they might be affiliated with the Republican Party. 

I should note that Etheridge apologized, saying he regrets his actions and wants to promote civil discourse. Also, the DNC's spokesman accused it of being a Republican operation. Mediaite comments on the anonymous nature of the interview and the possible provocation. 

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: the incident, the anonymous reporter, the DNC's accusation, Etheridge's apology, and the media's take on the situation. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
