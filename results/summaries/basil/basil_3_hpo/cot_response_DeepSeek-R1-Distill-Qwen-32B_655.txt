Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter. He grabbed the reporter and knocked the camera. The reporter claimed to be a student, but his face was blurred. The commentary from Big Government is critical of Democrats, calling them a "hard, progressive left" and blaming them for the country's issues. They also compare Etheridge to a founding father, which seems sarcastic.

Mediaite responds, questioning the reporter's credibility because the faces were blurred. They suggest it's a new form of journalism and that Etheridge's actions, while wrong, might be partly due to the situation. The DNC's spokesman accuses it of being a Republican operation, pointing out the blurred faces as evidence.

Etheridge later apologizes, saying he regrets his actions and that it doesn't justify his response, emphasizing respect and civil discourse.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "unreceptive," "irritated," "assault," "unpopular," "recession," "unemployed," "taxes," "maxed out," "hard," "progressive," "left," "run government," "ground," "age of Pericles," "long, hot summer," "target," "act accordingly," "provocative," "inflammatory," "courage," "anonymous," "ambush," "gotcha," "hatchet job," "credibility," "apologized," "regret," "poor response," "civil public discourse."

For the summary, I'll include these words to maintain the moral framing. I'll start by outlining the incident, then the reactions from different sides, and end with Etheridge's apology. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring all key moral points are included.
