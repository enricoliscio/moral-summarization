Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I should include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

Rep. Bob Etheridge had an incident where he grabbed a reporter's camera and wrist after being asked about supporting Obama's agenda. The reporter was anonymous, claiming to be a student. The article includes commentary from Big Government and Mediaite, each framing the event differently. Big Government criticizes Democrats for their policies leading to economic issues and calls Etheridge's actions a sign of a failing government. Mediaite questions the reporter's credibility, pointing out the blurred faces and anonymous nature. DNC's spokesman accuses Republicans of orchestrating the incident. Etheridge later apologized, acknowledging his poor reaction.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes the morally charged words: grabbed, knocking, grabs, captured, forced, recession, prospect, spike, maxed, succeeded, running, hit, assault, gotten, blurred, operation, hidden, job, service, treat, partisan, work, promote.

I should structure the summary to cover the incident, the different commentaries, and the aftermath. I'll make sure to use the listed words where appropriate without forcing them. The tone should reflect the moral judgment present in the original article.

I'll start by describing the incident with the morally charged verbs. Then, mention the commentaries, highlighting the economic terms and the accusations of a Republican operation. Finally, include Etheridge's apology and his commitment to promoting civil discourse.

Let me piece this together concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced.
