SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was recently involved in a controversial incident where he was approached by an anonymous reporter and asked if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." In the video, Etheridge appears irritated and asks the reporter's identity before knocking the camera to the ground and grabbing the reporter's wrist. The incident has sparked a debate about the ethics of anonymous and inflammatory interviews. Many have criticized Etheridge's response, with some arguing that he came off as a jerk. However, others have pointed out the problems with this new brand of "journalism," where the interviewer's faces were blurred and their identities hidden. The Democratic National Committee has also weighed in, suggesting that the incident was a Republican party tracking operation intended to undermine the Democrats. Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that his response was inappropriate and pledging to promote civil public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
