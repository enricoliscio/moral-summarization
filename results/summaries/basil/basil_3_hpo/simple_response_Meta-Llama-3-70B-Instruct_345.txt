SUMMARY:

In a disturbing display of aggression, Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) physically assaulted a student reporter who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the reporter's wrist and knocking the camera to the ground. The incident highlights the growing frustration and defensiveness of Democrats as their unpopular policies lead the country towards a deeper recession, higher taxes, and maxed-out national credit. The age of civility is indeed over, and the summer ahead will be long and hot. While Etheridge's actions are inexcusable, the anonymous and provocative nature of the interview raises questions about the new brand of "journalism" that may be contributing to the escalation of such incidents. The story serves as a warning to politicians and citizens alike to promote a civil public discourse, lest we descend into chaos and violence. END OF SUMMARY.
