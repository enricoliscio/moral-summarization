SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was recently involved in a controversial incident where he was approached by an anonymous reporter and asked if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." The congressman appeared irritated and grabbed the reporter's camera, knocking it to the ground. He then grabbed the reporter's wrist and demanded to know his identity. The incident has sparked a debate about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory assault interviews and the increasing unpopularity of the Democratic Party's agenda. Etheridge's actions have been criticized, but some argue that the new brand of "journalism" may have contributed to his response. The Democratic Party has accused Republicans of being behind the incident, calling it a "Republican party tracking operation." Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it was not justified despite the intrusive and partisan nature of modern politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
