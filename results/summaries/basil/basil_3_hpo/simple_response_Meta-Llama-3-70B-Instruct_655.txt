SUMMARY:

A video has surfaced showing Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) physically confronting an anonymous reporter who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. Etheridge's reaction was aggressive, knocking the camera to the ground and grabbing the reporter's wrist, demanding to know who he was. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable, while others suggest that the reporter's anonymous and provocative questioning may have contributed to the confrontation. The DNC has claimed that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, stating that he regrets his reaction and will work to promote a civil public discourse. The incident raises questions about the increasingly partisan and aggressive nature of modern politics. END OF SUMMARY.
