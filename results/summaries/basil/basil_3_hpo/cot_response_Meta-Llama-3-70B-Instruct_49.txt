SUMMARY:
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera behaving in a combative and irritated manner when asked by an anonymous reporter if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman's response was to grab the reporter's wrist and ask him to identify himself, after initially knocking the camera to the ground. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's actions were a result of being on edge due to "inflammatory" and "provocative" questioning tactics. Others have criticized the reporter's lack of transparency, with the DNC spokesman calling it a "Republican party tracking operation" with "motives" that are questionable. Etheridge has since apologized for his "poor" response, emphasizing the importance of promoting a "civil" public discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
