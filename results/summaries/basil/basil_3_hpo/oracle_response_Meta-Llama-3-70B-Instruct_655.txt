SUMMARY:

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera grabbing and knocking a camera to the ground when asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda by an anonymous reporter. The congressman appeared visibly irritated and asked the reporter to identify himself, before continually asking him to reveal his identity. The cameraman claimed they were just students working on a project. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's actions were unacceptable, while others suggest that the anonymous and inflammatory nature of the question may have contributed to his reaction. The DNC has claimed that the incident was a Republican party tracking operation, while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, stating that he will always work to promote a civil public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
