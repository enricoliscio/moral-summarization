SUMMARY:
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) recently found himself in hot water after a video surfaced showing him reacting *unreceptively* and *irritated* to an *anonymous* reporter's question about his support for the "Obama agenda." The North Carolina lawmaker was seen on camera grabbing the reporter's wrist and knocking down their camera, leading to criticism of his *poor* and *inflammatory* response. 

Etheridge later issued an apology, expressing *profound regret* for his actions and acknowledging that his *response* was not appropriate, even if the interview felt like an *ambush*. He affirmed his commitment to treating people with *respect* and promoting a *civil discourse*, regardless of political differences. 

The incident has sparked discussions about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory interviews and the increasing polarization of American politics. Some commentators blame a "hard, progressive left" for forcing through unpopular legislation, contributing to a tense political climate. 

The DNC spokesman, Brad Woodhouse, defended Etheridge, claiming the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation" and criticizing the interviewer's anonymity. 

This incident highlights the challenges faced by politicians in today's highly polarized and media-saturated environment. While Etheridge's initial *response* was deemed inappropriate, his subsequent apology and recognition of the need for *respect* and *civil discourse* are important steps toward defusing political tensions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
