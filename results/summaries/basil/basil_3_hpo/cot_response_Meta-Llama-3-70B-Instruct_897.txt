SUMMARY:
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera being unreceptive and irritated when asked by an anonymous reporter if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman's reaction was combative, grabbing the reporter's wrist and knocking the camera to the ground. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was a result of the "inflammatory" and "provocative" question. However, Etheridge has apologized for his reaction, stating that he "deeply and profoundly regret[s]" his behavior and will work to promote a civil public discourse. The incident has also raised questions about the motives behind the anonymous interview, with some suggesting it was a "Republican party tracking operation" aimed at discrediting Democrats.
