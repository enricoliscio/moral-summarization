Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a detailed news article and specific instructions on how to process it. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to first identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I'll start by reading through the article carefully. The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge's interaction with an anonymous reporter. He grabbed the reporter's camera and wrist, which seems aggressive. The reporter was asking about supporting the Obama agenda, which is a political stance.

Looking for morally framed words, I should identify terms that carry judgment or imply right/wrong. Words like "unreceptive," "grabbed," "irritated," "assault," "hard," "progressive," "unpopular," "recession," "unemployed," "taxes," "spike," "maxed out," "captured," "run government," "ground," "age of Pericles," "long hot summer," "target," "act accordingly," "defensible," "provocative," "courage," "anonymous," "ambush," "game," "gotcha," "hatchet job," "credibility," "apologized," "combative," "regret," "poor response," "civil public discourse."

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the key events and the moral implications from both sides. I'll mention Etheridge's aggressive actions, the context of the political climate, the accusations of a Republican operation, and his apology. I'll ensure the summary reflects the moral framing without bias, presenting both perspectives.

I should structure the summary to start with the incident, then the reactions from different sides, and end with the apology. This way, it captures the moral aspects from each viewpointâ€”Etheridge's overreaction, the criticism from the right, the defense from the left, and the eventual apology.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

Finally, I'll present the summary after the specified tokens, ensuring it's properly formatted and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I think I've covered all the steps and requirements. Let me put it all together now.

**SUMMARY:**  

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on video reacting aggressively to an anonymous reporter who asked if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." Etheridge grabbed the reporter's camera and wrist, sparking outrage. Critics accused him of assaulting a student, while others defended his actions, suggesting the reporter's anonymous and provocative approach may have provoked him. The encounter was framed as a symptom of a divided political climate, with some arguing it reflects the "progressive left" running government into the ground. Others criticized the anonymous nature of the interview, questioning its legitimacy. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse accused the incident of being a "Republican Party hatchet job," citing the blurred faces and hidden identity of the reporter. Etheridge later apologized, stating he regretted his "poor response" and committed to promoting "civil public discourse." The incident highlights tensions between political accountability and the ethics of anonymous journalism. END OF SUMMARY.
