SUMMARY: A video surfaced of Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) responding aggressively to an anonymous reporter's question about his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge appeared irritated, knocked the reporter's camera to the ground, and grabbed the reporter's wrist while demanding to know his identity. The incident sparked debate about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory interviews and the increasing political polarization in the country. Etheridge later apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it was inappropriate. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse defended Etheridge, suggesting that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation" designed to undermine the Democrat's credibility. The incident highlights the increasingly polarized and aggressive nature of political discourse in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
