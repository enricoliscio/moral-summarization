SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) found himself in hot water after a video surfaced of him grabbing and assaulting an anonymous reporter who asked if he supported the "Obama agenda." The congressman appeared irritated and asked the reporter "who are you?" before knocking the camera to the ground and grabbing the reporter's wrist. Etheridge's actions have been criticized as an assault and an overreaction, with some arguing that he hit away the camera and assaulted a student. The incident has sparked discussions about the ethics of anonymous and inflammatory interviews. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) spokesman, Brad Woodhouse, defended Etheridge, claiming that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation." Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it was a "poor response" and reaffirming his commitment to promoting civil public discourse. The incident raises questions about the boundaries of acceptable behavior for politicians and the media, especially in the context of partisan politics and intrusive interview techniques.
END OF SUMMARY.
