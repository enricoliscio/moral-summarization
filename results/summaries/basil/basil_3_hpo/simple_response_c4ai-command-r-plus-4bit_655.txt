SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) has come under fire for his aggressive reaction to an anonymous reporter's question regarding his support for the Obama agenda. The incident, which was caught on camera, shows Etheridge grabbing the reporter's wrist and knocking the camera to the ground. Etheridge's actions have been criticized as an assault on the freedom of the press and a sign of the Democrat's increasingly unpopular and aggressive "Obama agenda." The congressman has since apologized for his behavior, but the incident has raised questions about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory interviews and the growing political polarization in the United States. The Democratic National Committee has also responded, accusing the Republican Party of being behind the incident as a "hatchet job." The incident highlights the increasing tension and animosity in American politics, where ambush interviews and partisan tracking operations have become common.
END OF SUMMARY.
