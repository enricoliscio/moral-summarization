Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. 

So, Rep. Bob Etheridge had an incident where he grabbed a reporter's camera and wrist. The reporter was anonymous, claiming to be a student. The article includes different perspectives: Big Government accuses Democrats of failing and justifies Etheridge's actions, Mediaite questions the anonymous nature of the interview, and the DNC claims it's a Republican operation. Etheridge later apologized.

I need to capture all these points concisely. Start with the incident, then the reactions from different sources, and end with the apology. Keep it under 200 words. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects each side presents, like Big Government's criticism of Democrats and the DNC's accusation against Republicans. Also, note Mediaite's point about the anonymous nature of the interview.

Let me structure it: Incident, reactions from Big Government, Mediaite, DNC, and the apology. Each part should be brief but clear. Avoid getting bogged down in details, focus on the main moral arguments each party makes.

Double-check the word count. Keep each sentence tight. Make sure to include that the faces were blurred and the DNC's statement about it being a Republican operation. Also, mention that Etheridge apologized, emphasizing his regret and commitment to civil discourse.

I think that's all. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
