Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, who had an altercation with an anonymous reporter. The reporter, who identified himself as a student, asked Etheridge if he fully supported Obama's agenda. Etheridge got angry, grabbed the camera, and asked the reporter to identify himself. The reporter said they were just students working on a project. 

The article then includes commentary from Big Government, which criticizes Democrats for their policies and implies that Etheridge's actions are a sign of the times, with the progressive left causing problems. Mediaite responds, suggesting that the anonymous nature of the interview might have provoked Etheridge, comparing it to inflammatory journalism tactics. They note that the video's uploader is suspicious, with blurred faces, which makes the reporter's credibility questionable.

An update mentions the DNC's spokesman blaming the Republican Party for the incident, suggesting it was a setup. Finally, Etheridge apologized, acknowledging his poor reaction and regretting his behavior.

Now, the user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. The original text presents multiple viewpoints: Big Government's conservative critique, Mediaite's more balanced view, and the DNC's accusation against Republicans. The summary should reflect these perspectives without taking sides but highlighting the moral implications each side presents.

I should structure the summary to include the event, the different reactions, and the apologies. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary step by step:

1. Introduce the incident: Etheridge's reaction to the anonymous reporter.
2. Mention the reporter's identity and the question asked.
3. Describe Etheridge's actions and the immediate reactions.
4. Include Big Government's commentary, framing it as a sign of the times and a critique of Democrats.
5. Add Mediaite's perspective, questioning the reporter's credibility and the tactics used.
6. Note the DNC's statement blaming Republicans.
7. Conclude with Etheridge's apology and the broader implications on public discourse.

I need to ensure that each viewpoint is succinctly presented, maintaining the moral framing each side uses. For example, Big Government uses it to criticize Democrats, while Mediaite questions the ethics of anonymous reporting. The DNC accuses Republicans of setting up the situation, which is another layer of moral judgment.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to summarizing the events and the different moral stances presented in the article.
