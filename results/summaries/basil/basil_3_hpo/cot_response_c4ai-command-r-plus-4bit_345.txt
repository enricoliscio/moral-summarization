SUMMARY:
Congressman Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) reacted in an *unreceptive* manner to an anonymous reporter's question about his support for the "Obama agenda." In a video of the encounter, Etheridge appears *irritated*, grabbing the reporter's camera and wrist. The reporter, with his face blurred, identifies himself as a "student," but the congressman's actions have sparked debate about the ethics of such *provocative* and *inflammatory* interview techniques. Some argue that Etheridge's response was *poor*, coming off as a *jerk*, while others understand his reaction to what could be perceived as an *ambush*. The congressman has since expressed *regret* for his behavior, stating that he *profoundly* and *deeply* *regrets* his response and that he always strives to treat people with *respect*, despite the *unjustifiable* nature of such interactions. He emphasized the importance of promoting a *civil discourse*.
END OF SUMMARY.
