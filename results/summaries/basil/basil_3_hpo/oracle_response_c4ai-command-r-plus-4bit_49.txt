SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) has been caught on camera assaulting an anonymous reporter who asked him if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." The North Carolina lawmaker appeared irritated and asked the reporter, "who are you?" before knocking the camera to the ground and grabbing the reporter's wrist. The incident has raised questions about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory assault interviews and the increasing unpopularity of the Democratic Party's agenda. A Big Government post accompanying the video criticized the Democratic majority in Congress for forcing through legislation that has left the country on the cusp of a deeper recession with millions of unemployed. The DNC spokesman, Brad Woodhouse, defended Etheridge, claiming that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation." Rep. Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it does not justify a poor response and pledging to promote civil public discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
