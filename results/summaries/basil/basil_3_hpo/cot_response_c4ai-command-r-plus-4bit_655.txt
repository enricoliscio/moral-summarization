SUMMARY:
A recent incident involving Rep. Bob Etheridge has sparked a moral debate. The congressman was approached by an anonymous reporter who asked about his support for the "Obama agenda." Etheridge's response was visibly *unreceptive* and *irritated*, as he grabbed the reporter's wrist and knocked the camera to the ground. The congressman's behavior has been deemed *unethical* and *unjustifiable*, with some arguing that he came off as a *jerk*. The reporter's identity was blurred out, raising questions about the *courage* of anonymous protesters and the *provocative* nature of their *ambush* interviews. This incident reflects the *unpopular* opinion of the Democratic majority's legislative actions, which some believe have led the government into a *deeper recession* with *unemployed* Americans facing a bleak future. The congressman later issued an apology, expressing *regret* for his *poor response* and reaffirming his commitment to treating people with *respect* and promoting *civil discourse*. 

END OF SUMMARY.
