Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bob Etheridge. Let me read through the details carefully. 

The article describes an incident where Etheridge, a Democratic congressman, reacted strongly to an anonymous reporter who identified as a student. The reporter asked if Etheridge fully supported the Obama agenda. Etheridge got upset, grabbed the camera, and questioned the reporter's identity. The reporter claimed they were just doing a project, but their face was blurred in the video.

There are different reactions. Big Government criticized the Democrats for their policies and compared Etheridge's actions to those of a progressive left. Mediaite pointed out that the reporter's anonymity and the blurred faces might have contributed to Etheridge's reaction. They noted that such tactics are part of a new "journalism" trend.

The DNC's spokesman accused the Republican Party of being behind the incident, suggesting it was a setup. He pointed out that if it were a right-wing blog, they'd have identified themselves. 

Etheridge later apologized, admitting his poor reaction and expressing regret, stating he always tries to promote civil discourse.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll include the incident, the anonymous reporter's role, the reactions from different sides, the DNC's accusation, and Etheridge's apology. I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
