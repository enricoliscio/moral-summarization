SUMMARY:

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on video grabbing a self-identified "student" reporter who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appeared irritated, knocked the camera to the ground, and repeatedly asked the reporter to identify himself. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable, while others suggest that the anonymous and provocative nature of the interview may have contributed to his reaction. The DNC has released a statement suggesting that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, stating that he regrets his reaction and will work to promote a civil public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
