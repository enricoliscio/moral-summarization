SUMMARY: A video surfaced online of Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) reacting aggressively to a reporter's question about his support for the Obama agenda. Etheridge grabbed the reporter's wrist and knocked the camera to the ground. The incident sparked criticism and discussions about the ethics of anonymous inflammatory interviews. Mediaite pointed out the problems with this new brand of journalism, while Big Government used the incident to criticize the Democratic Party. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse defended Etheridge, claiming it was a Republican party tracking operation and that the anonymous interviewer's motives were suspect. Etheridge later apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it did not justify a poor response and that he strives to promote civil public discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
