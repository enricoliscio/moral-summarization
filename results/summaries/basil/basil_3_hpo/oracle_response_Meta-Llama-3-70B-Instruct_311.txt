SUMMARY:

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera grabbing and assaulting a self-identified "student" who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman's reaction was visibly irritated, and he knocked the camera to the ground, continually asking the reporter to identify himself. The cameraman's face was blurred out, raising suspicions about the true motives behind the encounter. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable, while others claim that the anonymous and inflammatory nature of the interview may have contributed to his reaction. The DNC has denounced the incident as a "Republican Party tracking operation," while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, promising to promote a civil public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
