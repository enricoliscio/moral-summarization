Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, focusing on the moral framing. First, I should understand what they're asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. 

The user has two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary preserving those words. I need to make sure I follow each step carefully. 

Looking at the article, I should go through it and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "unreceptive," "grabbed," "irritated," "assault," "project," "students," "progressive," "unpopular," "recession," "unemployed," "spike," "maxed out," "run government," "running it into the ground," "age of Pericles," "act accordingly," "provocative," "inflammatory," "courage," "ambush," "media training," "gotcha," "credibility," "hatchet job," "apologized," "regret," "poor response," "civil public discourse." 

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping these words in. The summary should be under 200 words and include all the identified terms. I should ensure the summary flows naturally while including all the moral terms without making it sound forced.

I should start by outlining the incident: Rep. Etheridge's reaction to the anonymous reporter. Then, mention the different perspectives from Big Government, Mediaite, and the DNC. Finally, include Etheridge's apology and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

I need to be careful not to add any new information beyond what's in the article. Also, the summary should remain neutral but include the moral language as per the instructions. I'll structure it to cover the event, the reactions, and the aftermath, ensuring all key points are covered succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on video reacting aggressively when an anonymous reporter, claiming to be a "student," asked him if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." Etheridge appeared visibly irritated, grabbed the reporter's camera, and demanded identification. The encounter sparked debate, with critics accusing Etheridge of assaulting the reporter and others suggesting the interview was a "Republican Party hatchet job." Mediaite questioned the anonymity of the reporter, noting the blurred faces and the possibility of inflammatory journalism. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse accused the Republican Party of orchestrating the incident. Etheridge later apologized, stating he regretted his "poor response" and committed to promoting "civil public discourse." The incident highlights tensions over anonymous interviews and the challenges of addressing provocative questions. END OF SUMMARY.
