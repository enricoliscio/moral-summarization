SUMMARY:
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera behaving in a combative manner when asked by an anonymous reporter if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The reporter, who claimed to be a student, was met with hostility and physical aggression by Etheridge, who grabbed the camera and the reporter's wrist, demanding to know who he was. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable and others suggesting that the reporter's provocative question and anonymous nature may have contributed to the altercation. Etheridge has since apologized for his reaction, acknowledging that it was a poor response and vowing to promote a civil public discourse. The incident has raised questions about the increasingly inflammatory nature of political discourse and the role of anonymous reporters in fueling the flames. END OF SUMMARY.
