SUMMARY: A disturbing incident involving Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) and an anonymous reporter has surfaced, raising questions about the boundaries of journalism and the integrity of our political leaders. The congressman's aggressive response to a simple question about his support for the Obama agenda has sparked criticism and concern. In the video, Etheridge appears irritated, knocks down the reporter's camera, and grabs the reporter's wrist while demanding to know his identity. This incident reflects a deeper issue: the increasingly unpopular Democratic majority in Congress and their failed attempts to improve the nation's economic situation. The aggressive response from Etheridge, a presumed representative of democratic values, is a stark contrast to the ideals of our founding fathers. As we approach a challenging summer, this incident serves as a reminder of the need for civil public discourse and respectful treatment of individuals, regardless of their political views. The Democratic National Committee has attempted to downplay the incident, blaming it on a "Republican party tracking operation." However, the congressman's apology acknowledges his inappropriate behavior and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a civil public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
