Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter. He grabbed the reporter's camera and wrist. The reporter was a student asking if Etheridge supported Obama's agenda. The video shows Etheridge getting angry and physically reacting. 

There are different perspectives here. Big Government comments on this, saying it's part of a trend where the left is causing issues, and they criticize the Democrats for poor governance. Mediaite responds, questioning the anonymous nature of the interview and suggesting it's a new form of journalism that's provocative. They point out the faces are blurred, which is suspicious.

The DNC spokesman, Brad Woodhouse, claims it's a Republican operation, pointing out the blurred faces and hidden sources. He thinks if it were a right-wing blog, they'd be open about it. 

Etheridge later apologized, saying he regrets his reaction and that it doesn't justify his behavior. He emphasized respect in public discourse.

So, the summary should include the incident, the reactions from different sources, and Etheridge's apology. It should be concise, under 200 words, and capture all key points without too much detail.
