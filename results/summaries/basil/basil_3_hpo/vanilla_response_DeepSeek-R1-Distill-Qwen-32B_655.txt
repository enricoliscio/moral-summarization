Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. So, Rep. Bob Etheridge from North Carolina had an incident with an anonymous reporter. The reporter asked him if he fully supported Obama's agenda, and Etheridge got really upset, grabbed the camera, and even grabbed the reporter's wrist. The reporter said they were students working on a project. 

The article also mentions some commentary from Big Government, which is critical of the Democrats and their policies, suggesting that Etheridge's reaction was part of a larger trend. Mediaite responds by questioning the legitimacy of the anonymous reporters, suggesting that the way the question was asked might have been provocative, and pointing out that the video's uploader is suspicious. 

There are updates where the DNC spokesman accuses Republicans of orchestrating this as a "gotcha" moment, pointing out that the faces were blurred and the source hidden. Finally, Etheridge apologized, saying he regrets his actions and that they don't justify his poor response.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the incident: Etheridge's confrontation with the anonymous reporter. Then mention the reporter's question and his reaction. Include the different perspectives: Big Government's criticism, Mediaite's doubts about the reporters' credibility, the DNC's accusation against Republicans, and Etheridge's apology.

I should keep each point concise. Make sure to include all key elements without going into too much detail. Also, ensure the summary flows logically from the incident to the reactions and the apology.

Let me structure it: start with the event, then the reporter's identity, the congressman's reaction, the commentary from Big Government, Mediaite's take, the DNC's statement, and the apology. Keep each part brief.

Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all these points clearly.
