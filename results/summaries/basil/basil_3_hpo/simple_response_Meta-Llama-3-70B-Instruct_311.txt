SUMMARY:

A video has surfaced showing Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) grabbing a self-identified "student" reporter who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appears irritated, knocks the camera to the ground, and demands the reporter's identity. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's actions were unacceptable, while others suggest that the anonymous and provocative nature of the interview may have contributed to his response. The DNC has claimed that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, stating that he regrets his reaction and will work to promote civil public discourse. The incident has raised questions about the nature of modern politics and the role of anonymous, inflammatory interviews in shaping public discourse.
