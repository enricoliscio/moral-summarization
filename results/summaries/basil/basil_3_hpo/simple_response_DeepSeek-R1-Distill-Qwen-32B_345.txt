Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter, leading to some physical confrontation. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with specific tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Rep. Etheridge grabbed a reporter's camera and wrist when asked about supporting Obama's agenda. The reporter was anonymous, claiming to be a student. The video shows Etheridge getting angry, which some see as a reaction to the progressive left's policies. Others, like Mediaite, suggest the reporter's methods were inflammatory. The DNC thinks it's a Republican operation. Etheridge apologized, saying it was a poor reaction.

Now, I need to preserve the moral framing. The original article seems critical of Etheridge's actions but also questions the reporter's methods. There's a mention of the progressive left and the state of the economy, which adds context. I should include these elements to maintain the author's perspective.

I'll start by stating the incident, then the reactions from different sides. Mention the DNC's suspicion and Etheridge's apology. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include the moral aspects, like the attack on civil discourse and the blurred faces suggesting a setup.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering the event, the reactions, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to end with the required tokens.
