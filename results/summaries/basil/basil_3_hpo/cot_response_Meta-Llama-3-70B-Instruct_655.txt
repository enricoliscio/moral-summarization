SUMMARY:
Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on camera reacting aggressively to a question from an anonymous reporter, who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appeared irritated, knocked the camera to the ground, and grabbed the reporter's wrist, demanding to know his identity. The incident was condemned as an "inflammatory assault" and an example of the "combative" behavior of some Democrats. Etheridge later apologized for his "poor" response, saying he deeply regrets his actions and will work to promote a "civil" public discourse. The incident has sparked debate about the use of "ambush" interviews and the role of anonymous reporters in politics. The DNC has accused the Republican Party of being behind the incident, calling it a "hatchet job." END OF SUMMARY.
