Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and specified certain words that carry moral connotations. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Etheridge had an altercation with an anonymous reporter, which led to some physical interaction. The article also discusses the political context and reactions from different parties.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the user provided. These include "grabbed," "knocking," "grabs," "captured," "forced," "recession," "prospect," "spike," "maxed," "succeeded," "running," "hit," "assault," "gotten," "blurred," "operation," "hidden," "job," "service," "treat," "partisan," "work," "promote."

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning the incident, using "grabbed" and "knocking." Then, I'll touch on the political context, using "captured" and "forced." I'll describe the economic situation with "recession," "prospect," "spike," and "maxed." 

I'll explain how the Democrats are perceived to have "succeeded" in running the government into the ground. Then, I'll move on to Etheridge's actions, using "hit" and "assault." The anonymous nature of the reporter will involve "blurred," "operation," and "hidden." 

Finally, I'll include the DNC's response, using "job," and Etheridge's apology, mentioning "service," "treat," "partisan," "work," and "promote."

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, preserving the moral tone from the original article. I'll make sure each sentence incorporates the necessary moral words without making it seem forced.

SUMMARY: Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was captured on video grabbing and knocking a student reporter's camera after being asked if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." The lawmaker appeared agitated, grabbing the reporter's wrist and repeatedly demanding identification. The reporter claimed to be part of a student project, but the encounter sparked outrage, with critics framing it as an assault on free speech. Big Government accused Democrats of running the government into the ground, while Mediaite questioned the ethics of anonymous, inflammatory interviews. DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse accused the incident of being a Republican "hatchet job," citing the blurred faces and hidden identities of the reporters. Etheridge later apologized, stating he regretted his reaction and vowed to promote civil discourse. The incident highlights tensions between partisans and the media, with both sides accusing each other of crossing lines. END OF SUMMARY.
