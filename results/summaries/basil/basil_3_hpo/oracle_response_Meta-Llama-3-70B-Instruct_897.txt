SUMMARY:

A video has surfaced showing Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) grabbing and knocking a camera to the ground when asked by an anonymous reporter if he "fully supported the Obama agenda." The congressman appears irritated and demands to know the reporter's identity, continually asking him to identify himself. The cameraman claims they are "just students" working on a project. The encounter has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's actions are indefensible, while others suggest that the anonymous and provocative nature of the interview may have contributed to his response. The DNC has labeled the incident a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that it fell short of promoting a civil public discourse. The incident has raised questions about the nature of modern politics and the tactics used to capture and force lawmakers into uncomfortable situations. END OF SUMMARY.
