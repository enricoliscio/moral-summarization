Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Rep. Bob Etheridge reacting to an anonymous reporter, and there's a lot of moral language involved. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Etheridge grabbed a reporter's camera, knocked it down, and grabbed the reporter's wrist. The reporter was anonymous, claiming to be a student. The author uses words like "grabbed," "knocking," "grab," which have negative connotations, showing disapproval of Etheridge's actions.

The article also mentions that the Democrats were in power and the author criticizes their policies, using words like "captured," "forced," "recession," "prospect," "spike," "maxed," "succeeded," "running," which imply that the Democrats mishandled the government. The author is suggesting that the Congressman's actions are a reflection of the party's failure.

There's a part where the reporter's face is blurred, and the DNC thinks it's a Republican operation. The author uses terms like "hit," "assault," "gotten," "blurred," "operation," "hidden," "job," which add to the moral framing, suggesting a conspiracy or underhanded tactics.

Etheridge later apologizes, using words like "service," "treat," "partisan," "work," "promote," which show his commitment to better behavior. The summary needs to include these terms to maintain the moral perspective.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll structure it to first describe Etheridge's actions, then the context of the political climate, the DNC's accusation, and finally his apology. Each section should incorporate the moral language to reflect the original framing.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article with the given moral terms. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each event and the associated moral implications.

The incident highlights tensions in partisan politics and the challenges of anonymous interviews, with critics arguing the encounter reflects a breakdown in respectful public dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
