SUMMARY:

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) was caught on video grabbing a self-identified "student" who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appeared irritated, knocked the camera to the ground, and asked the reporter to identify himself. The video sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable, while others pointed out that the reporter's anonymous and provocative question may have contributed to the altercation. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) claimed that the video was a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge later apologized for his behavior, stating that he regrets his reaction and will work to promote a civil public discourse. The incident has raised questions about the nature of modern journalism and the tactics used by some reporters.
