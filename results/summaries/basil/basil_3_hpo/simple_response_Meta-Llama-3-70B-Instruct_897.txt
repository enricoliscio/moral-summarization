SUMMARY:

A video has surfaced showing Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) grabbing a self-identified "student" who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appears irritated, knocks the camera to the ground, and asks the reporter to identify himself. The incident has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable, while others suggest that the anonymous and provocative nature of the interview may have contributed to his reaction. The DNC has responded by claiming that the incident was a "Republican party tracking operation," while Etheridge has apologized for his behavior, stating that he has always tried to treat people with respect and promote civil public discourse. The incident raises questions about the nature of modern politics and the tactics used by both sides.

END OF SUMMARY.
