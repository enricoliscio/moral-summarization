SUMMARY:

A video has surfaced showing Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) grabbing a self-identified "student" reporter who asked if he fully supported the Obama agenda. The congressman appears irritated, knocks the camera to the ground, and demands to know who the reporter is. The video has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Etheridge's behavior was unacceptable, while others suggest that the reporter's anonymous and provocative question may have contributed to the altercation. The DNC has responded, claiming that the video was a "Republican party tracking operation" and that the reporter's anonymity is suspicious. Etheridge has since apologized for his behavior, stating that he regrets his reaction and will work to promote a civil public discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
