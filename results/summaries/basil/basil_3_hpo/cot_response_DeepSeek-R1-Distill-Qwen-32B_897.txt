Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify the morally framed words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment or connotation, like "unreceptive," "irritated," or "assault." They help convey the author's stance on the events.

Looking at the article, Rep. Bob Etheridge had an altercation with an anonymous reporter. The reporter asked about supporting the Obama agenda, and Etheridge reacted aggressively. The article also includes commentary from Big Government and Mediaite, each with their own perspectives.

In STEP 1, I need to list all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a clear moral connotation. For example, "unreceptive" shows Etheridge's negative reaction, "irritated" indicates his emotional state, "assault" is a strong negative action, and "hatchet job" implies a malicious intent.

Next, the summary needs to include as many of these words as possible while being concise. I should mention the key events: the reporter's question, Etheridge's aggressive reaction, the commentaries from Big Government and Mediaite, the DNC's statement, and Etheridge's apology. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it by first stating the incident, then the reactions, the DNC's take, and end with the apology. I'll use the identified words to maintain the moral tone.

Wait, I should double-check if all the words I listed are indeed single words and carry a moral connotation. "Unreceptive," "irritated," "assault," "jerk," "defensible," "provocative," "inflammatory," "ambush," "credibility," "hatchet job," "regret," "apologized," "poor," "justify," "promote," "civil," "respect," "intrusive," "partisan." Yes, these all have moral implications.

Now, putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the event, the reactions, the DNC's accusation, and the apology. I'll make sure each sentence includes the relevant moral words without making it too wordy.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes all the necessary moral framing elements.

The reporter claimed to be a "student," but his face was blurred in the video, raising suspicions. Big Government criticized Etheridge's actions, linking them to the *unpopular* Obama agenda and a *progressive* left in Congress. Mediaite defended Etheridge, suggesting the interview was a *provocative* and *inflammatory* ambush. The DNC accused the incident of being a *Republican hatchet job*, citing the blurred faces and hidden motives. Etheridge later *apologized*, admitting his *poor* reaction and vowing to *promote civil discourse*. The incident highlights tensions between *intrusive* journalism and *partisan* politics. END OF SUMMARY.
