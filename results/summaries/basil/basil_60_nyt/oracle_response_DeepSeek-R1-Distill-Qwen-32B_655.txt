Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should keep certain morally charged words: "going," "harm," "profanity," and "called." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's campaign promise to build a wall on the Mexico border and his claim that Mexico will pay for it. The article mentions two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, who both oppose the idea and say Mexico won't pay. Fox uses profanity, which is a moral point, and Calderón calls the wall "stupid" and says it would harm the economy. Trump, on the other hand, insists Mexico will pay and criticizes Fox for his language.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's campaign rallies and the "familiar refrain," using "going" when referring to the plan. Then, I'll note Fox's use of "profanity." When Calderón speaks, I'll use "harm" regarding the economy. I'll also include how Fox "called" Trump egocentric and a false prophet, and Trump "called" Fox to apologize for the language.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating all the required moral terms. I'll structure it to first present Trump's stance, then Fox's and Calderón's responses, and finally Trump's reaction to their criticisms. This way, the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks, "Who’s gonna pay?" for his border wall, to which his supporters reply, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have made it clear that Mexico won’t pay, calling the idea "stupid" and "useless." Fox used profanity to express his opposition, while Calderón argued that the wall would harm the U.S. economy. Trump insists Mexico will pay, but he was angered by Fox’s tone, calling on him to apologize for the profanity. Fox, in turn, criticized Trump as egocentric and urged Hispanic voters to "open their eyes," calling Trump a "false prophet." Calderón also expressed disbelief about Trump’s claims on immigration, emphasizing that Mexico would not contribute a single cent to the wall. END OF SUMMARY.
