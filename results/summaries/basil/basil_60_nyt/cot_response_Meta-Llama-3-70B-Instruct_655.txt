SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's plan to build a giant wall along the US-Mexico border has been met with strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Both leaders have categorically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, with Fox calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values. Fox also expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox's sentiments, labeling the wall "stupid" and arguing that it would harm America's economy. Trump, however, remains adamant that he can compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. The exchange took a personal turn when Trump called on Fox to apologize for using profanity when discussing the wall, despite Trump's own history of using foul language in his campaign speeches.
