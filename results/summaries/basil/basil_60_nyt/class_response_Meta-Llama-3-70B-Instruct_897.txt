SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's plan to build a giant wall along the US-Mexico border has been met with strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Both leaders have categorically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which Trump estimates would cost around $8 billion. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox's sentiments, labeling the wall as "completely useless" and arguing that Trump is "misinformed" about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the US. Trump, however, has "insisted" that as president, he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall. The disagreement has turned into a war of words, with Trump calling on Fox to apologize for using profanity when discussing the wall.

END OF SUMMARY.
