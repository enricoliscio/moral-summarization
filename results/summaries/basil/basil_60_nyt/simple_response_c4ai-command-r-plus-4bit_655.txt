SUMMARY: In his campaign rallies, Donald Trump continues to rally his supporters with his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, insisting that Mexico will pay for it. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have strongly rejected this idea, calling the wall "stupid" and "useless." They argue that Mexico will not pay for the wall and that Trump is misinformed about immigration issues. Trump, undeterred by their opposition, maintains that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay. The exchange highlights the stark differences in perspectives and values between Trump and the former Mexican leaders, with Trump prioritizing border security and his supporters cheering his plans, while Fox and Calderón express outrage at the idea of a wall and the notion that Mexico will fund it. The moral dilemma lies in the potential harm to the US economy and the divisive nature of Trump's proposal, which has sparked debate and strong emotions on both sides of the border.
END OF SUMMARY.
