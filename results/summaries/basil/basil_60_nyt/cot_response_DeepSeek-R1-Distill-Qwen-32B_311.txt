Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context. It's about Donald Trump's campaign rallies where he talks about building a wall on the Mexico border and the reactions from Mexican former presidents.

The user wants me to identify all single words that are morally framed. I remember from the example they provided that words like "egocentric," "false prophet," "stupid," "harm," "foul," "criticized," and "apologize" were highlighted. I should go through the article again to spot any similar words that carry moral judgment.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include those morally framed words. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and structured with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

I also need to make sure I follow the format correctly, starting with STEP 1 and listing each morally framed word with a bullet point. Then, write the summary after that. I should avoid any markdown and keep it plain text as per the instructions.

Let me start by reading the article again to pick out those words. Trump is leading a "refrain" about the wall, which is a term that might have a neutral connotation. The fans reply "Mexico!" which is just a name. The Mexican government hasn't commented much, but former presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strong opinions. Fox calls Trump "egocentric" and says he's lacking in political values. He also refers to Trump as a "false prophet." Calderón calls the wall "stupid" and says it's "completely useless." He also argues that Trump is misinformed and that the wall would "harm" America's economy. Trump, on the other hand, insists Mexico will pay and criticizes Fox for using "foul" language, asking him to "apologize."

So the morally framed words are: egocentric, false prophet, stupid, useless, misinformed, harm, foul, criticize, apologize. I think that's all.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it concise. I'll start by mentioning Trump's rallies and the fans' response. Then, mention the former presidents' reactions, their use of the morally framed words, and Trump's response about the wall's cost and Fox's language. I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy.

I should also check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Let me draft it: Trump at rallies asks who'll pay for the wall, fans say Mexico. Fox and Calderón both oppose, calling Trump egocentric and the wall stupid. Fox refers to Trump as a false prophet, Calderón says it's useless and would harm the economy. Trump insists Mexico will pay and criticizes Fox's foul language, asking for an apology.

That should cover all the points and include the morally framed words. I think that's a solid summary.

**STEP 1:**  
* egocentric  
* false prophet  
* stupid  
* useless  
* misinformed  
* harm  
* foul  
* criticized  
* apologize  

**SUMMARY:**  
At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks, “Who’s gonna pay?” for the border wall, to which his supporters reply, “Mexico!” However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly opposed Trump’s plan, calling him “egocentric” and the wall “stupid” and “useless.” Fox criticized Trump for being a “false prophet” and questioned the judgment of Hispanic voters who supported him. Calderón argued that the wall would harm the U.S. economy and that Mexico would not pay for it. Trump insists Mexico will foot the bill but criticized Fox for using “foul” language, demanding an apology.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
