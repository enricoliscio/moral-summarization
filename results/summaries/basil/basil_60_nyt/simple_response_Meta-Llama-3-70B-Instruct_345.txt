SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have strongly rejected Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, emphasizing that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, while Calderón argued that the wall would be "completely useless" and harm the US economy. Both leaders expressed disbelief that Hispanic voters supported Trump, with Fox calling them "followers of a false prophet." Trump, on the other hand, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. The moral tone of the article suggests that Trump's plan is not only unrealistic but also morally reprehensible, as it seeks to exploit and demean Mexico and its people. The use of strong language by Fox and Calderón reflects their outrage and frustration with Trump's divisive and harmful rhetoric.
