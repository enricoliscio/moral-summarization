Alright, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Trump's border wall and the reactions from Mexican ex-presidents. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing words: going, harm, profanity, called.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the key points. Trump is pushing for a wall, saying Mexico will pay. The Mexican ex-presidents, Fox and Calderón, are against this, using strong language. Fox uses a profanity, and Calderón calls the wall "stupid." Trump, in turn, criticizes their tone, especially Fox's language.

I should identify the morally framed words. The author used "going," "harm," "profanity," and "called." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

Now, I'll outline the main points: Trump's campaign, the wall, Mexico's refusal, Fox's and Calderón's comments, Trump's response. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral elements.

I'll start by stating Trump's plan and the fan response. Then mention the ex-presidents' opposition, using "profanity" and "called" to describe their strong language. Include their criticism of Trump as egocentric and their disbelief in Hispanic support. Then, Trump's response about leverage and his criticism of Fox's tone, using "called" again.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, hits all key points, and includes the required moral words without being too verbose. Let me draft that and check the word count.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has repeatedly emphasized his plan to build a border wall with Mexico, insisting that Mexico will pay for it. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have firmly rejected this idea. Fox, using profanity, dismissed Trump's proposal, calling it unrealistic and criticizing Trump as "egocentric" and lacking political values. He also expressed disbelief that Hispanic voters supported Trump in the Nevada caucuses, urging them to "open their eyes." Calderón echoed Fox's stance, calling the wall "stupid" and emphasizing that Mexico would not pay a single cent. He also criticized Trump for being misinformed about immigration and warned that a closed border would harm the U.S. economy. Trump, meanwhile, has maintained that he would have the leverage to make Mexico pay, but he was angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for his profanity. END OF SUMMARY.
