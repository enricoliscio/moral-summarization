SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have publicly stated their opposition to Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and have asserted that Mexico will not pay for its construction. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his plan, stating that Trump should pay for the wall himself. He also expressed disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters in Nevada. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, argued that the wall would be useless and detrimental to the US economy, and that Trump was misinformed about immigration from Mexico. Trump, however, has maintained that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, which he estimates will cost $8 billion. The article also notes that Trump took issue with Fox's use of profanity in his statement.
