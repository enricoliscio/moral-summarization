SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have strongly rejected Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, emphasizing that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, while Calderón deemed the wall "stupid" and "completely useless". Both former presidents argued that the wall would harm America's economy and that Trump is misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico. Trump, on the other hand, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The exchange took a personal turn when Trump called on Fox to apologize for using profanity when discussing the wall. The moral framing of this story highlights the arrogance and lack of empathy displayed by Trump, who is willing to scapegoat and exploit a neighboring country for his own political gain.
