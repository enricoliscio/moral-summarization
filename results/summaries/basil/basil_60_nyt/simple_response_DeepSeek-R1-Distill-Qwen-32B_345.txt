Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Donald Trump's campaign rallies where he asks his supporters who will pay for the border wall, and they reply "Mexico!" The Mexican government hasn't commented much, but two former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder贸n, have spoken out against Trump's plan. Fox called Trump egocentric and said Mexico won't pay, using a profanity. He also criticized Hispanic voters for supporting Trump. Calder贸n echoed Fox, calling the wall stupid and useless, and pointed out Trump's misinformation about immigration and economic impacts. Trump, in response, insists he can make Mexico pay and was angered by Fox's language, calling for an apology.

Now, the moral framing here seems to highlight the conflict between Trump's assertiveness and the Mexican leaders' opposition. The article also touches on the issue of misinformation and the impact on Hispanic voters. I need to capture these elements in the summary without exceeding 200 words.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's campaign tactic, the responses from the former presidents, their criticisms, and Trump's reaction. I'll make sure to mention the moral aspects like Trump's egocentric nature and the potential harm to the economy.

Let me draft this, keeping it concise and within the word limit. I'll start with Trump's rallies, mention the former presidents' refusal to pay, their criticisms, and Trump's insistence and reaction. I'll end with the moral implications, such as the impact on Hispanic voters and the uselessness of the wall.

I think that covers all the key points while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the article. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: During his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks his supporters who will pay for the border wall, to which they respond, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder贸n have both rejected the idea, with Fox calling Trump "egocentric" and "lacking political values," and Calder贸n dismissing the wall as "stupid" and "completely useless." Both former leaders emphasize that Mexico will not foot the bill for the wall, which Trump estimates at $8 billion. Trump insists he can leverage Mexico into paying but appeared angered by Fox's use of profanity in his criticism. The article highlights the moral conflict between Trump's assertiveness and the former leaders' opposition, as well as the potential harm to Hispanic voters and the U.S. economy. END OF SUMMARY.
