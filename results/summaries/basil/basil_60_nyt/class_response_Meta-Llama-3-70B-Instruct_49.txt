SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar refrain, where he asks who will pay for his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border, and his fans respond with "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have a starkly different message for Trump: Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed similar concerns, labeling the wall as "completely useless" and arguing that Trump is "misinformed" about the flow of immigrants from Mexico. Trump, on the other hand, has "insisted" that as president, he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The exchange has devolved into a war of words, with Trump calling on Fox to apologize for using profanity when discussing the wall.
