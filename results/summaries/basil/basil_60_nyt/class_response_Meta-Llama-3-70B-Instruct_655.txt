SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar chant, where he asks who will pay for a giant wall along the US-Mexico border, and his fans respond with "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have a strong message for Trump: Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed similar concerns, labeling the wall as "completely useless" and arguing that Trump is "misinformed" about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the US. Trump insists that as president, he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. However, he seemed more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language.

END OF SUMMARY.
