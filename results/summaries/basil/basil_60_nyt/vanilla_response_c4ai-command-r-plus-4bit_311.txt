SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump often asks the crowd who will pay for the wall he plans to build along the US-Mexico border, to which his supporters chant "Mexico!" In response, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized him for his lack of political values and his appeal to Hispanic voters. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, argued that the wall would be useless and economically harmful to the US. Trump has maintained that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, but has also taken offense to Fox's use of profanity in his comments.
