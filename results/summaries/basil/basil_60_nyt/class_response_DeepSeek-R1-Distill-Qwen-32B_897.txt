Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words: "useless," "misinformed," "closing," and "insisted." 

First, I need to understand the article. It's about Donald Trump's campaign rallies where he talks about building a wall on the Mexico border. He asks who will pay, and his supporters say Mexico. The Mexican government hasn't commented much, but two former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have spoken out against Trump's plan. Fox called the wall "useless" and criticized Trump as egocentric and lacking political values. He also doubted Hispanic voters supporting Trump. Calderón echoed Fox, saying Mexico won't pay and that Trump is "misinformed" about immigration. Trump, on the other hand, "insisted" that he can make Mexico pay and got upset when Fox used profanity, calling for an apology.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes the words "useless," "misinformed," "closing," and "insisted." I should make sure these words are used in the context they were in the article.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's rallies and the "useless" wall, then Fox's criticism and "misinformed" part. Then Calderón's comments, and finally Trump's "insisted" on Mexico paying and his reaction to Fox's language.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Let me structure it step by step.

1. Trump's rallies and the wall idea.
2. Fox's "useless" comment and criticism of Trump.
3. Calderón's "misinformed" statement and his view on the wall.
4. Trump's "insisted" on Mexico paying and his reaction to Fox's language.

I think that covers all the points and includes the required words. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks, “Who’s gonna pay?” for his proposed border wall, to which his supporters reply, “Mexico!” However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have firmly opposed the idea, with Fox calling the wall “useless” and criticizing Trump as “egocentric” and “misinformed” about immigration. Calderón echoed Fox’s stance, stating Mexico would not pay for the wall and that Trump’s plan would harm the U.S. economy. Trump, meanwhile, has “insisted” that Mexico will ultimately foot the bill, though he appeared angered by Fox’s use of profanity in his criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
