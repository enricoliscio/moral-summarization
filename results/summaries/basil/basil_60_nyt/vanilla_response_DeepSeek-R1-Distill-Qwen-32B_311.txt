Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and the border wall. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Trump's campaign rallies where he asks his supporters who will pay for the wall, and they respond with "Mexico!" But the Mexican government hasn't really commented, except two former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, who both say Mexico won't pay. Fox used a profanity when saying Mexico won't pay, calling Trump "egocentric" and criticizing his political values. He also questions Hispanic support for Trump, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox, saying Mexico won't pay a cent and that the wall is a bad idea, also pointing out that Trump is misinformed about immigration and that closing the border would hurt the U.S. economy. Trump, however, insists he can make Mexico pay, estimating the cost at $8 billion. He also got upset about Fox's use of profanity and demanded an apology.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's campaign and the wall plan, then the former presidents' reactions. Highlight their refusal to pay, Fox's criticism, Calderón's points about immigration and economy, and Trump's response. Keep it concise, making sure all key points are included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to build a border wall with Mexico, prompting his supporters to chant, "Mexico!" when asked who will pay. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have firmly rejected the idea, stating Mexico will not contribute financially. Fox criticized Trump as "egocentric" and urged Hispanic voters not to support him, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Calderón dismissed the wall as "stupid" and useless, arguing it would harm the U.S. economy and that Trump is misinformed about immigration. Trump insists he can compel Mexico to pay, estimating the cost at $8 billion, but reacted angrily to Fox's profanity-laced remarks, demanding an apology. END OF SUMMARY.
