SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump routinely promises to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and makes the crowd chant that Mexico will pay for it. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n, have publicly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, calling Trump "egocentric" and his plan "stupid" and "useless". They argue that Trump is misinformed about immigration and that his plan would harm the US economy. Trump has responded by insisting he will make Mexico pay and by chastising Fox for using profanity. This exchange highlights the moral issues at play in Trump's wall plan, including the potential harm to US-Mexico relations and the questionable ethics of forcing another country to fund a project that primarily serves US interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
