SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, with Mexico footing the bill, has been met with strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Both leaders have categorically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, with Fox calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values. Calderón echoed Fox's sentiments, labeling the wall as "stupid" and "completely useless". Trump, on the other hand, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The exchange took a personal turn when Trump called on Fox to apologize for using profanity when discussing the wall. The moral framing of this exchange highlights the importance of respecting international relationships and not relying on bullying tactics to achieve one's goals.
