SUMMARY: At his rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly claims Mexico will pay for his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n, have adamantly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless." They argue that Trump is misinformed about immigration issues and that closing the border would harm the US economy. Trump, undeterred, insists he will make Mexico pay, despite criticism from Fox for his profane language. 

END OF SUMMARY.
