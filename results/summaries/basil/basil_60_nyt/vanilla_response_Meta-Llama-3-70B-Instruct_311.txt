SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have spoken out against Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, saying that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, while Calderón argued that the wall would be "completely useless" and harm the US economy. Both former presidents expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses. Trump has insisted that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. However, he seemed more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language when discussing the wall. The Mexican government has remained silent on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
