SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have rejected Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, while Calderón argued that the wall would be "completely useless" and harm the US economy. Trump has insisted that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. However, Trump appeared more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language when discussing the wall. The Mexican government has remained silent on the issue, but these statements from former presidents suggest strong opposition to Trump's plan.

END OF SUMMARY.
