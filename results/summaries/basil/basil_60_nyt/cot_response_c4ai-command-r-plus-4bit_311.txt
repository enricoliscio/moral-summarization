STEP 1:
* Egocentric
* False prophet
* Stupid
* Useless

SUMMARY:
Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have both strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and have stated that Mexico will not pay for its construction. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump an "egocentric" and a "false prophet," expressing disbelief at his support among Hispanic voters. He also used profanity to emphasize that Mexico would not be paying for the wall, stating that Trump should pay for it himself. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, echoed these sentiments, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless." He further argued that Trump's understanding of immigration issues was misinformed and that a closed border would harm the US economy. Trump, meanwhile, has maintained that he will have the leverage to force Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion, while also criticizing Fox for his use of profanity.
