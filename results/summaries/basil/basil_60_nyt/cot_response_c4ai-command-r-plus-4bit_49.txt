* Egocentric

* Stupid
* Useless

SUMMARY:
Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, declaring that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump an "egocentric" follower of a "false prophet," expressing disbelief at his support among Hispanic voters. He asserted that Trump should pay for the wall himself, given his substantial wealth. Calderón, Fox's successor, echoed these sentiments, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless." He further argued that Trump's understanding of immigration issues was misguided and that a closed border would damage the US economy. Trump, undeterred, maintains that he will force Mexico to finance the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. However, he took offense at Fox's profanity-laced criticism, demanding an apology for the foul language. END OF SUMMARY.
