SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump consistently asserts that Mexico will pay for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n, have adamantly stated that Mexico will not pay for such a wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless." They argue that the wall would harm America's economy and that Trump is misinformed about immigration from Mexico. Trump, in turn, insists that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. The article also notes Trump's use of profanity in his campaign speeches and his criticism of Fox for using foul language. Fox, in response, calls Trump "egocentric" and criticizes Hispanic supporters of Trump for following a "false prophet."
