SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly opposed Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his lack of political values, expressing disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters. He also used profanity to emphasize that Mexico would not bear the cost of the wall. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, echoed Fox's sentiments, calling the wall "stupid" and "useless." He further argued that Trump was misinformed about immigration and that closing the border would hurt the US economy. Despite their opposition, Trump has maintained that he will have the leverage to force Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. However, he took issue with Fox's use of profanity, demanding an apology despite his own frequent use of foul language in campaign speeches. END OF SUMMARY.
