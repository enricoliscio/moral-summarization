SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have rejected Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, saying that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, while Calderón described the wall as "stupid" and "completely useless". Both former presidents argued that the wall would harm the US economy and that Trump is misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico. Trump has insisted that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. However, Trump appeared more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language when talking about the wall.

END OF SUMMARY.
