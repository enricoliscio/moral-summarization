STEP 1:
* Egocentric
* False prophet
* Stupid
* Useless

SUMMARY:
Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have vehemently opposed Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and have asserted that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, who served from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and a "false prophet," expressing disbelief at his support among Hispanic voters. He also used profanity to emphasize that Mexico would not bear the cost of the wall. Calderón, Fox's successor, echoed similar sentiments, calling the wall "stupid" and "useless." He further argued that Trump was misinformed about immigration and that closing the border would hurt the US economy. Meanwhile, Trump has insisted that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. However, he took issue with Fox's use of profanity, despite being known for using profanity himself during campaign speeches.
END OF SUMMARY.
