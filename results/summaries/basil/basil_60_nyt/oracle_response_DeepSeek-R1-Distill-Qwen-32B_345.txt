Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and the morally framed words: going, harm, profanity, called. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is pushing for a wall on the Mexico border, asking who will pay, and his supporters say Mexico. The Mexican ex-presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, both oppose this. Fox used profanity, which is a moral point, and called Trump egocentric. Calderón said Mexico won't pay and criticized Trump's understanding of immigration. Trump insists Mexico will pay but was angered by Fox's tone, pointing out his own use of profanity in speeches.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's campaign rallies and the "Mexico will pay" chant. Then, the ex-presidents' responses, including Fox's use of profanity and his criticism of Trump. Calderón's points about the wall being useless and the economic harm. Finally, Trump's stance on leverage and his reaction to Fox's language.

I should ensure that the words "profanity," "called," "going," and "harm" are included. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral elements are highlighted.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump frequently asks his supporters, "Who’s gonna pay?" for his proposed border wall, to which they reply, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have both rejected the idea, with Fox using profanity to emphasize his opposition and calling Trump "egocentric." Calderón echoed Fox's stance, stating Mexico won’t pay for a "stupid wall" and arguing it would be useless and harm the U.S. economy. Trump insists Mexico will pay, but he appeared angered by Fox’s tone, calling on him to apologize for the profanity. The moral framing highlights the conflict over responsibility, the use of profanity, and the potential harm caused by the wall. END OF SUMMARY.
