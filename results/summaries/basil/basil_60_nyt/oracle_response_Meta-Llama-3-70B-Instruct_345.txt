SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar refrain, where he asks who will pay for the giant wall he plans to build along the US-Mexico border. His fans enthusiastically respond, "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have a stern message for Trump: Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters. Fox also used profanity to comment on the wall, saying "I'm not going to pay... He should pay for it. He's got the money." Calderón echoed Fox's sentiments, calling the wall "stupid" and arguing that it would harm America's economy. Trump has insisted that he would compel Mexico to pay for the wall, but appeared more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language.

END OF SUMMARY.
