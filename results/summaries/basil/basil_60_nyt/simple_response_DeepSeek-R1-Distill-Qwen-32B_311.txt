Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Trump's campaign promise to build a wall and Mexico's former presidents opposing it. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Trump asks his supporters who will pay for the wall, and they say Mexico. The Mexican government hasn't commented much, but former presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have spoken out. Both oppose Trump, calling him egocentric and saying Mexico won't pay. They also criticize his understanding of immigration and the economic impact. Trump insists he can make Mexico pay and was upset by Fox's language.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects. Fox and Calderón are criticizing Trump's approach as unfair and unwise, highlighting the immorality of forcing Mexico to pay. Trump's response about the language shows defensiveness, which might imply he's sensitive to criticism. The summary should reflect this tension and the moral stance against Trump's wall plan.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's campaign, the former presidents' opposition, their reasons, and Trump's reaction. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it has drawn strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. During his rallies, Trump asks his supporters who will pay, to which they reply, "Mexico!" However, Fox and Calderón have both rejected this idea, with Fox calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking political values, and Calderón labeling the wall "stupid" and economically harmful. Both former presidents emphasize that Mexico will not contribute financially to the wall. Trump, however, insists that as president, he can compel Mexico to pay, though he recently criticized Fox for using profanity in his criticism. The moral framing highlights the tension between Trump's assertive campaign promises and the ethical concerns raised by Mexican leaders about fairness and mutual respect in international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
