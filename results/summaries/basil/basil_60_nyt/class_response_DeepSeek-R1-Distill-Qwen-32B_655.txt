Okay, so I need to help this user who is asking me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the original author's moral stance.

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about Trump's campaign promise to build a wall on the Mexico border and Mexico's former presidents opposing it. The key points are Trump's rallies, the "Mexico will pay" chant, the former presidents' refusal, their criticism of Trump as egocentric and misinformed, and Trump's response about leverage and anger over Fox's language.

Now, the user wants the summary to include the morally framed words: "useless," "misinformed," "closing," and "insisted." I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's wall plan, the fan chant, Mexico's refusal, Fox and Calderón's criticisms, and Trump's response. Then, I'll integrate the moral words into the summary. For example, using "useless" when describing the wall's effectiveness, "misinformed" regarding Trump's understanding of immigration, "closing" the border, and "insisted" on Mexico paying.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally. I'll make sure to capture the opposition from the former presidents and Trump's reaction to Fox's language. Also, I'll highlight the economic impact argument from Calderón.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first introduce Trump's plan, then the fan response, followed by the former presidents' criticisms using the moral words, and conclude with Trump's insistence and reaction. I'll make sure the summary is clear and preserves the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump frequently promises to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, insisting Mexico will pay for it. At rallies, his supporters chant "Mexico!" in response to his question, "Who’s gonna pay?" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have firmly rejected this idea. Fox called the wall "useless" and criticized Trump as "egocentric" and "misinformed," urging Hispanic voters to "open their eyes." Calderón echoed Fox, stating Mexico would not pay a "single cent" for the wall, which he deemed "completely useless." He also argued Trump was misinformed about immigration and warned that closing the border would harm the U.S. economy. Trump, meanwhile, has insisted he can compel Mexico to pay, though he was angered by Fox's use of profanity in their exchange. END OF SUMMARY.
