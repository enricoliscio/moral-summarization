SUMMARY: In his campaign rallies, Donald Trump has been promoting his plan to build a wall along the Mexico border to enhance border security, asserting that Mexico will pay for it. This claim has been refuted by two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Fox, who served from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his lack of political values, expressing disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters. Meanwhile, Calderón, president from 2006 to 2012, argued that Trump was misinformed about immigration and that the wall would harm the US economy. Trump has stood by his claim that he can compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion, but took issue with Fox's use of profanity when discussing the matter. 

END OF SUMMARY.
