Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and the border wall. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning Trump's campaign rallies where he asks his supporters who will pay for the wall, and they reply "Mexico!" Then, it talks about the Mexican government's response. Two former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, both oppose Trump's plan and state that Mexico won't pay for the wall. Fox uses a profanity to emphasize his point and criticizes Trump as egocentric. He also questions how Trump did well with Hispanic voters in Nevada. Calderón agrees, calling the wall "stupid" and useless, and argues that Trump is misinformed about immigration and the economic impact.

On Trump's side, he believes he can make Mexico pay, estimating the cost at $8 billion. However, he was angered by Fox's language and asked for an apology.

So, the main points are:
- Trump's wall plan and the "Mexico will pay" chant.
- Fox and Calderón's opposition and refusal to pay.
- Their criticisms of Trump's policies and character.
- Trump's response to Fox's language.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's plan, the former presidents' refusal, their criticisms, and Trump's reaction. I should make sure to include the key quotes and the main arguments from both sides.

I'll structure it by introducing Trump's plan, then the two former presidents' opposition, their reasons, and finally Trump's response. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me draft it:

"Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall with Mexico has sparked opposition from two former Mexican presidents. Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón both stated Mexico won't pay for the wall, calling it a'stupid' and 'useless' project. Fox criticized Trump as egocentric and questioned his appeal to Hispanic voters. Calderón argued the wall would harm the U.S. economy and that Trump is misinformed about immigration. Trump insists Mexico will pay, but he reacted angrily to Fox's use of profanity, demanding an apology."

That's concise and covers all main points. Let me check the word count. It's under 200 words, so it should be good.
