Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico and the reactions from Mexican former presidents. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. Trump is asking Mexico to pay for the wall, and his supporters chant "Mexico!" in response. The Mexican government hasn't commented much, but Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have spoken out against it. Fox calls Trump "egocentric" and uses a profanity to express his opposition. He also criticizes Trump's supporters among Hispanic voters, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Calderón says Mexico won't pay and calls the wall "stupid" and "useless." He also points out that Trump is "misinformed" about immigration and that closing the border would harm the economy. Trump, on the other hand, insists he can make Mexico pay and gets angered by Fox's language.

The author used specific morally framed words: "useless," "misinformed," "closing," and "insisted." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I should structure the summary to include Trump's demand, the former presidents' opposition, their use of the framed words, and Trump's response. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral tone.

Let me start drafting: Trump is pushing Mexico to pay for the wall. Fox and Calderón both oppose it, using terms like "useless" and "misinformed." They argue the wall is unnecessary and economically harmful. Trump insists Mexico will pay but gets upset about Fox's language. I need to include all these elements while keeping the summary tight.

I should also make sure to mention the key points without adding extra information. Focus on the moral framing words and the main arguments from both sides. Make sure the summary is clear and captures the essence of the article.

After drafting, I'll check the word count and ensure all the framed words are included. Maybe start with Trump's demand, then the former presidents' responses, their criticisms, and Trump's reaction. That should cover the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for his proposed border wall, a demand met with opposition from Mexican former presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Fox dismissed Trump as "egocentric" and "misinformed," calling the wall "useless" and urging Hispanic voters to reject Trump's "false prophet" narrative. Calderón echoed Fox's stance, asserting that Mexico would not contribute a "single cent" for the wall, deeming it a "stupid" project. Trump, however, has insisted that as president, he would have the leverage to make Mexico pay, though he appeared angered by Fox's use of profanity in their exchange. END OF SUMMARY.
