SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border has been met with strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Both leaders have categorically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, with Fox calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values. Calderón echoed the sentiment, labeling the wall as "stupid" and "completely useless." Trump, on the other hand, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. However, he seemed more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language. The two former presidents also expressed disbelief and concern over Trump's performance with Hispanic voters, with Fox calling them "followers of a false prophet." END OF SUMMARY.
