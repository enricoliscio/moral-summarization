SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have vehemently rejected Donald J. Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and his claim that Mexico will pay for it. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his lack of political values, while also expressing disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters in Nevada. He adamantly refused to pay for the wall, stating that Trump should bear the cost himself. Similarly, Calderón, who led Mexico from 2006 to 2012, called the wall "stupid" and "useless," arguing that Trump was misinformed about immigration and that closing the border would hurt the US economy. Trump, undeterred by their opposition, maintains that he will force Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. He also took issue with Fox's use of profanity during the interview.
