SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar refrain, where he asks who will pay for his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border, and his fans reply that Mexico will. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have strongly rejected this notion, stating that Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump performed well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed these concerns, arguing that the wall would be "completely useless" and would harm America's economy. Trump has insisted that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, but appeared more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using profanity when discussing the wall. The former presidents' strong opposition to Trump's plan highlights the harm that such a wall could cause.
