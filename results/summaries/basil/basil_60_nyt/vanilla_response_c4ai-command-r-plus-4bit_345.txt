SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump often asks the crowd who will pay for the wall he plans to build along the Mexico border, to which his supporters reply, "Mexico!". However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his plan, saying that Trump should pay for the wall himself. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, argued that the wall would be useless and harmful to the US economy. Trump has insisted that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, but was angered by Fox's use of profanity when discussing the wall.
