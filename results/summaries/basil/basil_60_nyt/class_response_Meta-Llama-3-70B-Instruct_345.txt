SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar refrain, where he asks who will pay for the giant wall he plans to build along the US-Mexico border, and his fans respond with "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have a clear message for Trump: Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump did well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox's sentiments, calling the wall "completely useless" and arguing that Trump is "misinformed" about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the US. Trump, on the other hand, has "insisted" that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The exchange highlights the stark contrast between Trump's stance and the Mexican government's opposition to the wall.
