Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and an example response, so I need to understand the key points and the moral aspects involved.

First, the article is about Trump's campaign where he repeatedly asks his supporters who will pay for the wall, and they respond Mexico. The moral framing here is about responsibility and fairness—Trump is making Mexico pay, which some see as unfair.

Then, two former Mexican presidents, Fox and Calderón, both oppose Trump's plan. Fox calls Trump egocentric and a false prophet, while Calderón says the wall is useless and economically harmful. Their moral stance is against Trump's proposal, highlighting the unfairness and impracticality.

Trump counters by saying he can make Mexico pay, but gets upset when Fox uses profanity, which adds another layer of morality regarding respect and decorum in public discourse.

I need to make sure the summary captures these moral elements: the unfairness of making Mexico pay, the criticism of Trump's leadership, and the debate over respectful communication.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to flow logically, starting with Trump's campaign, then the responses from Mexico, and finally Trump's reaction. Each part should reflect the moral viewpoints presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump frequently asks his supporters who will pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico, to which they respond, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have firmly rejected this idea, calling it "stupid" and "useless." Fox criticized Trump as "egocentric" and urged Hispanic voters to "open their eyes," calling Trump a "false prophet." Calderón argued that the wall would harm the U.S. economy and that Mexico would not contribute a "single cent." Trump insists he can force Mexico to pay, but he also condemned Fox for using profanity in his criticism. The moral framing highlights the unfairness of expecting Mexico to fund the wall and the divisiveness of Trump's rhetoric, while also emphasizing the importance of respectful dialogue in public discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
