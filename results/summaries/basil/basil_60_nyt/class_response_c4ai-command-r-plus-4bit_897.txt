SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have both expressed strong opposition to Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for its construction. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized him for his lack of political values, while also expressing disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters in Nevada. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, argued that Trump is misinformed about immigration and that the wall would be useless and harmful to the US economy. Despite their objections, Trump has insisted that he will have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, which he estimates will cost $8 billion. However, Trump took issue with Fox's use of profanity in his statement, calling for an apology despite his own frequent use of foul language in campaign speeches.
END OF SUMMARY.
