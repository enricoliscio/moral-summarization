Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and the border wall. They mentioned that the summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump's campaign rallies where he asks who will pay for the wall, and his supporters say Mexico. Then, it mentions that two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have both stated that Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump egocentric and criticized him for his use of profanity, while Calderón argued that the wall would be useless and that Trump is misinformed about immigration.

I should make sure to include all these key points: Trump's rallies, the supporters' response, Fox and Calderón's opposition, their comments about Trump, and Trump's response regarding Mexico paying. Also, I need to note the cost estimate and the economic impact mentioned by Calderón.

I'll structure the summary to start with Trump's rallies, then introduce the former presidents' reactions, their criticisms, and Trump's stance. I'll keep it under 200 words and ensure it's clear and concise. Let me check the word count as I draft it to make sure it fits.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump frequently asks his supporters who will pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico, to which they respond, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have both explicitly stated that Mexico will not foot the bill. Fox criticized Trump as "egocentric" and urged Hispanic voters to "open their eyes," calling Trump a "false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox's stance, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless," while also arguing that Trump is misinformed about immigration and the economic impact of closing the border. Trump, meanwhile, insists he can leverage Mexico into paying the estimated $8 billion cost but was angered by Fox's use of profanity in their exchange. END OF SUMMARY.
