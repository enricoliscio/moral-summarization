SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar refrain, where he asks who will pay for the giant wall along the US-Mexico border, and his fans respond with "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have a clear message for Trump: Mexico won't pay. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Trump did well with Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón echoed similar concerns, stating that the wall would be "completely useless" and would harm America's economy. Trump insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. However, when Fox used profanity to comment on the wall, Trump called on him to apologize for his tone.

END OF SUMMARY.
