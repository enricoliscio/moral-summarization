SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have spoken out against Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, saying that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, while Calderón argued that the wall would be "completely useless" and harm the US economy. Trump has insisted that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. However, Trump appeared more angered by Fox's tone, calling on him to apologize for using foul language when talking about the wall. Both former presidents expressed disbelief that Trump did well with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses, with Fox calling them "followers of a false prophet".

END OF SUMMARY.
