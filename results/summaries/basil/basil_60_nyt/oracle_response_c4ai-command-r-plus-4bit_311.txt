SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly opposed Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his use of profanity in reference to the wall, demanding an apology. He also expressed disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, echoed Fox's sentiments and argued that the wall would be useless and harmful to the American economy. Despite their opposition, Trump has insisted that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, which he estimates will cost $8 billion. However, his focus has shifted to criticizing Fox's use of profanity. END OF SUMMARY.
