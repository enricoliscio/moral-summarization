SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly opposed Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, who served from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his political values, expressing disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters. He also used profanity to emphasize that Mexico would not bear the cost of the wall. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, echoed Fox's sentiments, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless." He further argued that Trump was misinformed about immigration issues and that closing the border would negatively impact the US economy. Trump, undeterred, has insisted that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. He also took issue with Fox's use of profanity, demanding an apology. The exchange highlights the tense relationship between Trump and Mexican officials over his controversial border wall proposal.
