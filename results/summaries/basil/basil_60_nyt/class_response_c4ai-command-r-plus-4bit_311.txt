SUMMARY: Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border has been met with opposition and criticism from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Fox, who served from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and asserted that Mexico will not pay for the wall, stating that Trump should pay for it himself. He also expressed disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters in Nevada, referring to them as "followers of a false prophet." Calderón, Mexico's president from 2006 to 2012, echoed Fox's sentiments, calling the wall "completely useless." He further argued that Trump is misinformed about immigration and that closing the border would harm the US economy. Despite their objections, Trump has insisted that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. Trump took issue with Fox's use of profanity in his comments.
END OF SUMMARY.
