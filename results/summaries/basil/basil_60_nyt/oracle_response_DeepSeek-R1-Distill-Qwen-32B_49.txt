Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally framed words: going, harm, profanity, and called. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's campaign where he talks about building a wall and Mexico paying for it. The article mentions two former Mexican presidents opposing this idea, using strong language, and criticizing Trump's approach.

I should identify the key elements: Trump's rallies, the wall, Mexico's refusal, the use of profanity, and the criticism of Trump's policies. I need to make sure the summary includes these points and uses the specified moral words.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's rallies, the "Mexico will pay" chant, Fox and Calderón's opposition, their use of profanity, and their criticism of Trump. I'll also note Trump's response to the criticism.

Now, I'll structure the summary, ensuring it's concise and within 200 words. I'll use the words "going," "harm," "profanity," and "called" where appropriate. For example, Fox "called" Trump egocentric and used "profanity." Calderón said the wall would be "harmful" and "useless."

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's plan, then the opposition from the former presidents, their strong language, and Trump's response. I'll end by mentioning the debate over immigration and the wall's impact.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the moral framing and stays within the word limit. I'll check that all key points are included and that the specified words are used appropriately.

SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks, "Who’s gonna pay?" for the border wall, to which his supporters reply, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have firmly rejected this idea, with Fox using profanity to emphasize that Mexico won’t pay and calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values. Fox also criticized Hispanic voters who supported Trump in Nevada, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox’s stance, stating that Mexico would not pay for the "stupid" wall and arguing it would be completely useless. Trump, meanwhile, insists he can compel Mexico to pay, but he was angered by Fox’s tone and called for an apology for using profanity. The debate highlights tensions over immigration, border security, and the potential harm to the U.S. economy from Trump’s proposed policies. END OF SUMMARY.
