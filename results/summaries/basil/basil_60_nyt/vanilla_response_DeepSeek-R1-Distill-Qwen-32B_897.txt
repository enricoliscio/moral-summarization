Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Mexico's response to his wall proposal. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by talking about Trump's campaign rallies where he asks who will pay for the wall, and his supporters answer Mexico. Then, it mentions that the Mexican government hasn't commented much, but two former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have spoken out. Fox used a profanity to say Mexico won't pay and criticized Trump as egocentric. He also doubts Trump's support among Hispanic voters. Calderón called the wall "stupid" and useless, and pointed out that Trump is misinformed about immigration and the economic impact. Trump, on the other hand, insists he can make Mexico pay and is upset about Fox's language.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Trump's proposal, the former presidents' responses, their criticisms, and Trump's reaction. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Trump's plan, then the former presidents' opposition, their reasons, and ending with Trump's response.

I should make sure to mention Fox's use of profanity and his dismissal of Hispanic support for Trump. Calderón's points about the wall's uselessness and economic impact are important too. Also, Trump's belief in his leverage and his criticism of Fox's language are key points.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. I need to be concise but cover all main aspects without getting too detailed. Maybe start with Trump's plan, then introduce the former presidents and their arguments, then Trump's response.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has repeatedly asked his supporters who will pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico, to which they reply, "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have firmly rejected the idea of Mexico footing the bill. Fox criticized Trump as "egocentric" and urged Hispanic voters not to be deceived by him, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Calderón dismissed the wall as "stupid" and useless, arguing it would harm the U.S. economy and that Trump is misinformed about immigration. Trump, meanwhile, insists he can compel Mexico to pay and was angered by Fox's use of profanity in his comments. END OF SUMMARY.
