SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have publicly stated their opposition to Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, declaring that Mexico will not pay for its construction. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, criticized Trump for his egocentric and morally bankrupt campaign, which includes stoking fears about immigration and promising to erect a costly and unnecessary barrier between the two nations. Fox also expressed disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, argued that Trump's plan was based on misinformation and would ultimately harm the US economy. Trump, true to form, responded with anger, seemingly more concerned with Fox's tone and language than the moral and practical arguments against his discriminatory and costly proposal. This exchange highlights the moral and practical bankruptcy of Trump's campaign promises, which rely on fear-mongering and scapegoating rather than sound policy or ethical considerations.
END OF SUMMARY.
