SUMMARY: In his campaign rallies, Donald Trump often promises to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and insists that Mexico will pay for it. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have publicly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized him for his lack of political values, while also expressing disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters. Calderón, who was president from 2006 to 2012, argued that Trump was misinformed about immigration and that the wall would be useless and harmful to the US economy. Trump has maintained that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion, but has also taken offense at Fox's use of profanity in his comments.
END OF SUMMARY.
