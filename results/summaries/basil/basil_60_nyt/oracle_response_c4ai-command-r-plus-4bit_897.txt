SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump regularly asserts that Mexico will pay for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n, have publicly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, calling it a "stupid" and "useless" idea. They argue that the wall would harm America's economy and that Trump is misinformed about immigration from Mexico. Trump has responded with anger, particularly at Fox's use of profanity, and demanded an apology. The exchange highlights the strong opposition to Trump's wall proposal from Mexican leaders and questions the feasibility of his plan to make Mexico pay for it. It also raises concerns about the potential negative impact on US-Mexico relations if Trump were to become president.
