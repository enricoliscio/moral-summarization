SUMMARY:

Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have strongly rejected Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, with Mexico footing the bill. They called the idea "stupid" and "useless", and emphasized that Mexico will not pay a single cent for it. Fox went as far as to call Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and questioned the judgment of Hispanic voters who supported Trump in the Nevada caucuses. Calderón argued that closing the border would harm America's economy and that Trump is misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico. Trump, on the other hand, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The exchange highlights the deep divide between Trump's nationalist rhetoric and the concerns of Mexico's leaders.
