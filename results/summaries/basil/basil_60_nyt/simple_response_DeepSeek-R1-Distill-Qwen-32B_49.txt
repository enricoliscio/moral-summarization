Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Donald Trump's campaign rallies where he asks his supporters who will pay for the border wall, and they reply "Mexico!" The Mexican government hasn't commented much, but two former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have spoken out against Trump's plan. Fox called Trump egocentric and criticized the wall as a waste of money, while Calderón dismissed the idea as useless and pointed out that Trump is misinformed about immigration. Trump, on the other hand, insists he can make Mexico pay, but he was more upset by Fox's language, calling for an apology.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements. Fox and Calderón are criticizing Trump's approach, highlighting the immorality or impracticality of the wall. Trump's response is about making Mexico pay, which is a point of contention. I should include their criticisms and Trump's counterarguments, but keep it concise, under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's rallies and the "Mexico" response. Then, introduce Fox and Calderón's opposition, their reasons, and their criticism of Trump. Finally, mention Trump's belief in Mexico paying and his reaction to Fox's language. I need to make sure it's clear that the former presidents are morally opposing the wall, not just disagreeing on policy.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll start with Trump's rallies, then Fox's comments, Calderón's, Trump's response, and wrap up with the implications. That should cover all the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks his supporters who will pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico, to which they respond, "Mexico!" While the Mexican government has not commented extensively, former presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly opposed the plan. Fox criticized Trump as "egocentric" and dismissed the wall as a waste of money, calling Trump a "false prophet" and questioning Hispanic support for him. Calderón echoed Fox's sentiment, stating Mexico would not pay for the "stupid wall" and arguing it would harm the U.S. economy. Trump insists he can force Mexico to pay, but he was angered by Fox's use of profanity, calling for an apology. The former presidents' criticisms highlight the moral and practical flaws of Trump's plan, while Trump doubles down on his demand for Mexico to foot the bill. END OF SUMMARY.
