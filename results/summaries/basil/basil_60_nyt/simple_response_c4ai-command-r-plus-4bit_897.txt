SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump routinely pledges to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, insisting that Mexico will pay for it. This claim has been refuted by two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, who argue that Mexico will not pay and that the wall is unnecessary and harmful to both countries' economies. Fox calls Trump a "false prophet" and criticizes his lack of political values, while Calderón disputes Trump's understanding of immigration patterns. Trump, undeterred, maintains that he will force Mexico to foot the bill for the wall, estimated at $8 billion. He takes offense at Fox's use of profanity and demands an apology, despite his own frequent use of expletives in speeches. This exchange highlights the contentious relationship between Trump and Mexico, with Trump's insistence on building a wall and his expectation that Mexico will finance it, contrary to the strong opposition from Mexican officials and the potential economic repercussions for both nations.
