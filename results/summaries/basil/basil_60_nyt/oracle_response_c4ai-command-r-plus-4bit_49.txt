SUMMARY: At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump regularly asserts that he will build a wall along the US-Mexico border and that Mexico will pay for it. However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n, have strongly opposed this idea, stating that Mexico will not pay for any part of the wall. They also criticized Trump's character and his understanding of immigration issues, arguing that his plan would harm America's economy. Trump has responded with anger, particularly at Fox's use of profanity, despite Trump himself often using profanity in his campaign speeches.

Mr Fox called on Hispanics who support Trump to open their eyes, labeling them followers of a false prophet. The former presidents' comments highlight the strong opposition to Trump's wall plan in Mexico and the potential negative consequences it could have for US-Mexico relations. Trump's insistence on building the wall and making Mexico pay continues to be a controversial aspect of his campaign.
