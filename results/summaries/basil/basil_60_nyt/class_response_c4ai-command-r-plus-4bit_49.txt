SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón sent a clear message to Donald J. Trump: Mexico will not pay for his proposed wall along the border. Fox, who served from 2000 to 2006, called Trump "egocentric" and criticized his plan as "useless." He expressed disbelief at Trump's support among Hispanic voters, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Calderón, who led Mexico from 2006 to 2012, echoed Fox's sentiments and argued that Trump is misinformed about immigration. He further stated that closing the border would harm the US economy. Despite their opposition, Trump has insisted that he will have the leverage to make Mexico pay for the wall, estimated at $8 billion. However, he took issue with Fox's use of profanity in expressing his views.
END OF SUMMARY.
