SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign rallies often feature a familiar chant, where he asks who will pay for the wall along the US-Mexico border, and his fans respond with "Mexico!" However, two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n, have made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. They have strongly opposed Trump's plan, calling him "egocentric" and lacking in political values. Fox even went as far as to call Trump's supporters "followers of a false prophet." Both former presidents argue that the wall would be useless and harm the US economy. Trump, on the other hand, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The moral of the story is that Trump's divisive rhetoric and unrealistic promises are being rejected by those who truly understand the complexities of international relations and the impact of such a wall on the economy.
