STEP 1: 
* Egocentric
* False prophet
* Stupid
* Useless

SUMMARY: Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have strongly opposed Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and have asserted that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, called Trump an "egocentric" and a "false prophet," expressing disbelief at his support among Hispanic voters. He also used profanity to emphasize that Mexico will not fund the wall, stating that Trump should pay for his own "stupid" project. Calderón, Fox's successor, echoed these sentiments, calling the wall "useless" and arguing that it would harm the US economy. Trump, undeterred, has insisted that he will force Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. However, he took issue with Fox's use of profanity, despite his own penchant for profane language in his campaign speeches. END OF SUMMARY.
