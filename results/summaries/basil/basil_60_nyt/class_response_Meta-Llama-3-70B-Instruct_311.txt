SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's plan to build a giant wall along the US-Mexico border has been met with strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Both leaders have categorically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, with Fox calling it a "stupid" idea and Calderón labeling it "useless". Fox went further, calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values, and expressed disbelief that Hispanic voters supported him, calling them "followers of a false prophet". Calderón argued that Trump is "misinformed" about the flow of immigrants from Mexico and that closing the border would harm America's economy. Trump, however, has "insisted" that as president, he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The exchange has turned heated, with Trump calling on Fox to apologize for using foul language.
