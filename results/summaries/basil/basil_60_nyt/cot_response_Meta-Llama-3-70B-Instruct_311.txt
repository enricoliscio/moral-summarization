SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's plan to build a giant wall along the US-Mexico border has been met with strong opposition from two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. Both leaders have unequivocally stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, with Fox calling Trump "egocentric" and lacking in political values. Calderón described the wall as "stupid" and argued that it would harm America's economy. Trump, however, insists that he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion. The debate took a personal turn when Trump called on Fox to apologize for using foul language to describe the wall, despite Trump's own history of using profanity in his campaign speeches. The exchange highlights the deep divisions and strong emotions surrounding Trump's controversial proposal. END OF SUMMARY.
