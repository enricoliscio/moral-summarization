Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should use the words "going," "harm," "profanity," and "called" as they were framed morally in the article.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's campaign where he asks his supporters who will pay for the wall, and they reply Mexico. The Mexican ex-presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, both oppose this, using strong language like profanity and calling Trump egocentric and a false prophet. They also argue that the wall is useless and would harm the economy.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's campaign and the "going" to build the wall. Then, note Fox's use of "profanity" and his "called" Trump as egocentric. Calderón also "called" the wall stupid and said it would "harm" the economy. Trump insists Mexico will pay, but Fox's tone angers him, leading Trump to demand an apology for the "profanity."

I'll structure the summary to include all these elements, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I should ensure that the moral framing is clear and that the specified words are used appropriately. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
At his campaign rallies, Donald Trump repeatedly asks his supporters, "Who’s gonna pay?" for the border wall, to which they reply, "Mexico!" However, former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón have firmly rejected the idea, with Fox using profanity to emphasize his opposition and calling Trump "egocentric" and "lacking in any political values." Fox also criticized Hispanic voters who supported Trump, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Calderón echoed Fox’s sentiment, stating, "Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!" He also argued that Trump’s plan would harm the U.S. economy and was misinformed about immigration flows. Trump, meanwhile, insists Mexico will pay, but he was angered by Fox’s tone, calling on him to apologize for his profanity.  
END OF SUMMARY.
