SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, an FBI official involved in high-profile investigations, was fired due to anti-Trump text messages exchanged with his colleague, Lisa Page. The messages revealed a biased opinion against Trump and raised concerns about the integrity of the investigations. Strzok's firing has been cheered by Trump allies, who see him as the "poster child" for anti-Trump bias within the FBI. However, Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and "deeply troubling." The firing highlights the concerns regarding the potential impact of personal bias on official duties, with some believing Strzok "willing" to use his position against Trump. This incident has severely damaged the FBI's reputation, with Trump calling them "clowns and losers." The investigation into the matter continues, with the inspector general referring five FBI employees for further scrutiny. The public is left questioning the extent to which personal beliefs influence the actions of those in power, and whether the disciplinary actions taken were appropriate and independent. 

END OF SUMMARY.
