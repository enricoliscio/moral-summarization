SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who led investigations into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, was fired after 21 years of service. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review process and the Deputy Director had the authority to review and modify the disciplinary findings. Strzok's firing comes after President Trump and his allies repeatedly attacked him, citing anti-Trump bias within the bureau. Strzok's text messages, including one vowing to "stop" Trump from becoming president, were seen as evidence of bias. Republicans cheered the firing, saying Strzok's conduct damaged the FBI's reputation and public trust. Strzok's attorney argued that there was no evidence his personal views affected his work. The firing raises concerns about the politicization of the FBI and the impact on public trust in institutions.

END OF SUMMARY.
