SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, a decision his attorney claims is a "departure" from standard practice and "motivated" by politics. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, said Deputy Director David Bowdich "overruled" the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him, a move that should be "deeply troubling" to all Americans. Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process after his anti-Trump text messages were referred to the Office of Professional Responsibility. President Trump, who has "hammered" Strzok and cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias, tweeted "finally" in response to the firing, calling the Russia case a "hoax" with "no collusion, no obstruction." Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, saying the deputy director "reversed" the decision of a career FBI official, who concluded that a 60-day suspension and demotion were the appropriate "punishment." Strzok's firing has sparked controversy, with Republicans cheering the move and Democrats decrying it as a politically motivated "decision."

END OF SUMMARY.
