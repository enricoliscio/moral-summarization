SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, was fired after anti-Trump text messages were revealed. Strzok's attorney claimed that his client was politically motivated and that his firing was a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to the standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump cheered the firing, calling Strzok a "bad player" and claiming that the Russia case was a hoax. Republicans have raised concerns about anti-Trump bias in the FBI, pointing to Strzok's text messages as evidence. Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, saying that his personal views never affected his work and that the deputy director reversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline. The firing has raised questions about the FBI's handling of disciplinary action and the impact of personal bias on investigative decisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
