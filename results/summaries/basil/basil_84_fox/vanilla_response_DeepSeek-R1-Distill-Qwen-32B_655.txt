Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

First, Peter Strzok was a key figure in both the Russian interference investigation and the Hillary Clinton email probe. He became controversial after anti-Trump text messages were revealed. His attorney says he was fired abruptly and claims it's politically motivated, with the Deputy Director overriding the standard disciplinary process. The FBI responds that their process was followed, involving an internal review and the Deputy Director's authority.

Strzok started a Twitter account reacting to his firing, expressing sadness and linking to a GoFundMe page. President Trump and his allies have criticized him, calling him an example of anti-Trump bias. Trump even asked if the Russia case would be dropped because of this. The article mentions that Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after his texts with Lisa Page were found. The DOJ inspector general's report didn't find bias affecting prosecutorial decisions but highlighted the texts mixing politics with work.

Republicans, including Mark Meadows, argue that Strzok's actions tarnished the FBI's reputation. His attorney counters that his personal views didn't impact his work, and no evidence was found to the contrary. The Justice Department didn't comment. The text messages from last year show Strzok and Page discussing politics and criticizing Trump, with Strzok vowing to stop Trump from becoming president. The IG report also looked into the Clinton email probe handling.

In summary, the key points are Strzok's firing, the reasons given by both his attorney and the FBI, political reactions, especially from Trump and Republicans, the context of the text messages and the IG report, and the implications for the FBI and the investigations he was involved in.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and reactions without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to include the firing, the reasons, political motivations, reactions from both sides, and the context of the text messages and investigations.
