SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, has been fired following the revelation of anti-Trump text messages. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, while the FBI asserts it followed standard procedure. Strzok has denied that his personal views impacted his work, but Republicans have raised concerns about bias. President Trump cheered the firing, suggesting the Russia case should be dropped, while Strzok's supporters claim his termination was unjustified. Strzok's text messages with colleague Lisa Page revealed anti-Trump sentiments, and an inspector general report referred five FBI employees for investigation over politically charged texts. The firing highlights ongoing concerns about political bias within the FBI and Justice Department.
END OF SUMMARY.
