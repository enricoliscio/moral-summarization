Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that Peter Strzok, a key figure in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email investigations, has been fired. His attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and not following standard procedures. The FBI's response is that he went through their review process and was disciplined accordingly.

Strzok was involved in both the Clinton email probe and the Russian meddling investigation. He exchanged anti-Trump messages with Lisa Page, which came to light last year. This led to his removal from the special counsel's team and loss of security clearance. The IG report found no bias affecting prosecutorial decisions but didn't address the Russia probe.

President Trump and his allies have been critical of Strzok, calling him a symbol of anti-Trump bias. Trump tweeted about the firing, hoping the Russia case might be dropped. Republicans believe his bias influenced the Russia investigation, despite the IG findings.

Strzok defended himself in Congress, saying his personal opinions didn't affect his work, but Republicans accused him of bias. His attorney argues the firing was unfair and that there's no evidence his views impacted his job. The Justice Department didn't comment, and Lisa Page has already left the FBI.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on key points: Strzok's firing, reasons behind it, reactions from both sides, and implications for the investigations. I should make sure to include that the IG report didn't find bias affecting Clinton's case but that Republicans are concerned about the Russia probe. Also, note that the FBI said it followed standard procedures, while Strzok's attorney disputes that.

I'll structure the summary by starting with his firing, then the reasons (anti-Trump texts, IG report), reactions from Trump and Republicans, Strzok's defense, and the political implications. Keep it concise and ensure all major points are covered without getting too detailed.
