SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, a decision his attorney Aitan Goelman claims is a "departure from standard practice" and "politically motivated". Goelman argues that Deputy Director David Bowdich "overruled" the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove Strzok, a move that should be "deeply troubling to all Americans". Strzok's termination follows a scathing DOJ inspector general report that highlighted his anti-Trump text messages, which President Trump and his allies have repeatedly hammered as evidence of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. Trump tweeted "finally" in response to the firing, questioning whether the Russia case will now be dropped. Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, saying the deputy director "reversed" the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline, and that a lengthy investigation failed to produce evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. The firing has sparked controversy, with Republicans cheering the move and Democrats decrying it as a "hoax".
