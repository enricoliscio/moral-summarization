SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a leading role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, has been fired after anti-Trump text messages were revealed. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, while the FBI states that Strzok underwent the standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing, suggesting the Russia case should be dropped due to Strzok's bias. Strzok had exchanged messages with colleague Lisa Page, expressing anti-Trump sentiments and discussing the Clinton email probe. Republicans have raised concerns about the impact of bias on the Russia investigation, with one Strzok text vowing to "stop" Trump. Strzok defended himself in a congressional hearing, but Republicans maintained he exhibited bias. Strzok's attorney maintains that his personal views did not affect his work, but the FBI's deputy director overruled the initial disciplinary decision. The firing has been cheered by Trump's allies, who see Strzok as a symbol of anti-Trump bias within the FBI.
END OF SUMMARY.
