SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who led the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI says Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in an inspector general report. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page were discovered. He was escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance in June. Strzok's attorney says the deputy director overruled the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him. Strzok has launched a GoFundMe page and reacted to his firing on Twitter, saying he is "deeply saddened" by the decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
