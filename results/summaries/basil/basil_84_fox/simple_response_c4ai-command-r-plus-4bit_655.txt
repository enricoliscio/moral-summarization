SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, was fired for expressing anti-Trump sentiments in text messages with his colleague, Lisa Page. Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, while the FBI states that the decision was made through its standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump and his allies cheered the firing, with Trump himself tweeting that Strzok was "in charge of the Witch Hunt" and asking if the Russia case will now be dropped. The firing has raised questions about the role of political bias in the FBI's investigations, with Republicans expressing concern that anti-Trump bias may have influenced the start of the Russia probe. Strzok's attorney maintains that there is no evidence that Strzok's personal views impacted his work. The case highlights the ethical dilemma of ensuring impartiality in law enforcement and safeguarding against abuse of power.
END OF SUMMARY.
