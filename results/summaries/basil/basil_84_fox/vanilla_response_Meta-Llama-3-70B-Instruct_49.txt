SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who led investigations into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI says Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process after an inspector general report highlighted his conduct. President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Strzok, tweeted "finally" in response to the news and questioned whether the Russia case would be dropped. Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page, which led to his removal from the special counsel probe. Republicans have raised concerns that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the Russia investigation. Strzok's attorney says the deputy director overruled the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him, and that a lengthy investigation found no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work.

END OF SUMMARY.
