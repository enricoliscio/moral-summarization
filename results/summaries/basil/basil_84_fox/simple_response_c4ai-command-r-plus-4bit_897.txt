SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who was involved in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, has been fired due to anti-Trump text messages that were discovered. Strzok's lawyer claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, while the FBI asserts that the decision was made through their standard review and disciplinary process. This incident has sparked concerns among Republicans about potential anti-Trump bias within the FBI and has led to criticism of Strzok's conduct. The text messages in question revealed Strzok's personal opinions and raised doubts about his ability to remain impartial in his work. Strzok defended himself in a congressional hearing, but his efforts were unsuccessful in saving his job. This event highlights the importance of maintaining public trust in institutions like the FBI and the need for officials to uphold impartiality and professionalism in their duties.
