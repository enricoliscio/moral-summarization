SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a key role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, has been fired following the revelation of anti-Trump text messages. Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI states that Strzok went through the standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump cheered the firing, suggesting that the Russia investigation should now be dropped. Strzok had been removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery of the text messages, and was later escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance. Republicans have raised concerns about anti-Trump bias within the FBI, while Strzok defended his actions in a congressional hearing. Strzok's attorney maintains that his personal views never affected his work. The FBI's inspector general report referred five employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts.

END OF SUMMARY.
