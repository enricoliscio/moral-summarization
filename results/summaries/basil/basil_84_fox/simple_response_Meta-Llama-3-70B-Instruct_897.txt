SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, has been fired after being accused of anti-Trump bias due to text messages exchanged with colleague Lisa Page. Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, as the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion instead. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. Trump tweeted "finally" in response to the firing, suggesting that the Russia case may now be dropped. Strzok's attorney argues that there is no evidence that his personal views affected his work, while Republicans claim that his bias impacted the start of the investigation into Russian meddling. The firing has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a politically motivated attack on the FBI's integrity, while others believe it is a necessary step to restore public trust.

END OF SUMMARY.
