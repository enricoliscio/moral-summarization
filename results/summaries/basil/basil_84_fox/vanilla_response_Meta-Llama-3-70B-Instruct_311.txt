SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Strzok, tweeted "finally" in response to the news. Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page were discovered. A DOJ inspector general report found no evidence that bias impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe, but Republicans have raised concerns about anti-Trump bias in the Russian meddling investigation. Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, saying the deputy director overruled a decision to give Strzok a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok has launched a GoFundMe page and tweeted that he is "deeply saddened" by the decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
