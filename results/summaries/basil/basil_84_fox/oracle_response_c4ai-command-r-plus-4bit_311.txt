SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russia meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired. This decision has been politically motivated by President Trump and his allies, who have hammered and cast Strzok as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau. They cheered his termination, claiming that Strzok tried to use his position to stop Trump from getting elected and damaged the FBI's reputation. However, Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, stating that the deputy director overruled the decision of the career FBI official and reversed the punishment, despite no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. The firing is deeply saddened Strzok, who has been the target of President Trump's attacks for months, with the president calling the Russia case a hoax and denying any collusion or obstruction. This departure from standard practice raises concerns about the potential impact of political bias on disciplinary action within the FBI.
END OF SUMMARY.
