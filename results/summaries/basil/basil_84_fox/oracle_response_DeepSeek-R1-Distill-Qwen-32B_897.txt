Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. I'll start by identifying the key points of the article.

Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI. His attorney claims it's politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI says it was a standard process after an IG report. Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump messages, which became public. Trump and his allies have criticized him, calling him biased. The IG found no bias affecting prosecutorial decisions, but Republicans are still concerned. Strzok's attorney argues his personal views didn't impact his work. The text messages showed his anti-Trump stance, and more employees might face discipline.

Now, I need to incorporate the moral words. Words like "fired," "motivated," "overruled," "authority," "saddened," "hammered," "charge," "hoax," "collusion," "obstruction," "mix," "stop," "exhibited," "use," "try," "damaged," "reversed," "punishment," "blasting," "called," "action."

I'll structure the summary to include these words, making sure the moral framing is clear. I'll mention Strzok's firing, the political motivation claim, the overruling by the deputy director, the authority behind the decision, Strzok's sadness, the criticism from Trump allies, the charge of bias, the hoax and collusion claims, mixing politics with work, his vow to stop Trump, exhibiting bias, using his position, trying to stop Trump, damaged reputation, reversed decision, punishment, blasting by the attorney, calling him a clown, and potential further action.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points with the moral terms.

SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, a key figure in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, was fired, with his attorney claiming the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. Strzok’s attorney accused Deputy Director David Bowdich of overruling the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility, calling the decision troubling for Americans. The FBI defended the process, stating it followed standard review and disciplinary procedures. Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump texts with colleague Lisa Page, was removed from the special counsel probe last year. President Trump and his allies have hammered Strzok, casting him as emblematic of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and DOJ. Trump tweeted that the firing was “finally” and questioned whether the Russia case would be dropped, calling it a “hoax.” Strzok’s attorney blasted the bureau, stating a 60-day suspension and demotion were appropriate punishment, but the deputy director reversed the decision. The attorney emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok’s personal views to his work. Strzok’s texts, including a vow to “stop” Trump, have been Exhibit A for Republicans alleging bias. His firing has been cheered by Trump allies, who argue his conduct damaged the FBI’s reputation. END OF SUMMARY.
