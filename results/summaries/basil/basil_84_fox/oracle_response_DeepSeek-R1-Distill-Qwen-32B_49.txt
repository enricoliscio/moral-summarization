Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI, which is a significant event. His attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard procedures. The FBI's response justifies the decision, but there's a conflict here. 

I should note that Strzok was involved in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton probes. His anti-Trump texts made him a political lightning rod. The firing was overruled by the Deputy Director, which the attorney finds troubling. 

The summary needs to include words like "departure," "motivated," "overruled," "decision," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the FBI's explanation and the attorney's claims. Also, mention the political implications, such as Trump's reaction and the impact on the FBI's reputation.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Strzok's firing, the reasons given, the political context, and the reactions from both sides. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words where appropriate to maintain the author's framing.

Let me draft a concise summary that includes all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and incorporates the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
FBI official Peter Strzok, a key figure in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, was fired, sparking claims of politically motivated decision-making. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, accused the FBI of departing from standard procedures, stating Deputy Director David Bowdich "overruled" the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Goelman called the firing "deeply troubling," while the FBI defended the action as part of its disciplinary process. Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump texts with colleague Lisa Page, was previously removed from the special counsel probe. President Trump and his allies have long criticized Strzok, casting him as emblematic of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and DOJ. Trump tweeted, "finally," suggesting the Russia case might be dropped, calling it a "hoax" with no collusion or obstruction. Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, claiming no evidence linked his personal views to his work. The firing has reignited debates over bias and trust in federal agencies. END OF SUMMARY.
