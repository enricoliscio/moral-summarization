SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, has been fired due to apparent political bias against President Trump. Strzok's anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page raised concerns about the impartiality of the FBI's investigations. While the Inspector General found no evidence that bias impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton probe, Republicans have argued that it played a role in the start of the Russia investigation. Strzok's firing has been praised by Trump and his allies, who see it as a step towards addressing anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. However, Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, arguing that Strzok's personal views never affected his work. The FBI has stated that Strzok was subject to the standard review and disciplinary process. This incident highlights the importance of maintaining public trust in institutions like the FBI, where impartiality and non-partisanship are paramount.
END OF SUMMARY.
