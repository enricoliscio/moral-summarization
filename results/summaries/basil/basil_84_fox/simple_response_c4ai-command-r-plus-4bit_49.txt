SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, was fired for expressing his political opinions in text messages with colleague Lisa Page. Strzok's attorney claims that the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, as Strzok's personal views did not affect his work. President Trump and his allies have celebrated Strzok's termination, with Trump claiming that Strzok was the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the FBI and that the Russia investigation is a "total hoax." The firing raises questions about the integrity of the FBI's disciplinary process and the potential impact of political bias on investigations. This incident highlights the importance of maintaining public trust in institutions like the FBI, where bias and political motivation must not be tolerated.

END OF SUMMARY.
