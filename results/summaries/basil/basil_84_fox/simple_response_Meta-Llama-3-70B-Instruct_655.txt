SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who led investigations into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review process and the Deputy Director had the authority to review and modify disciplinary findings. Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after anti-Trump text messages were discovered. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias within the FBI. Trump tweeted "finally" in response to the firing, suggesting the Russia case may be dropped. Strzok's attorney argues that the decision is "deeply troubling" and that Strzok's personal views did not affect his work. Republicans, on the other hand, have repeatedly raised concerns about anti-Trump bias in the FBI.

END OF SUMMARY.
