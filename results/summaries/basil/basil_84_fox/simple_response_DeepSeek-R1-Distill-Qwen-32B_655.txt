Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

First, the article mentions that Strzok was fired, and his attorney claims it's politically motivated. The FBI's response says it followed standard procedures. Strzok's attorney argues that the deputy director overruled the professional responsibility office, which is a point about due process and fairness. That's a moral angle about fairness in the disciplinary process.

Then, the article talks about Strzok's anti-Trump texts and how they were used against him. President Trump and his allies see him as an example of anti-Trump bias in the FBI and DOJ. This highlights a moral issue about political bias affecting professional roles, which is a significant point to include.

Strzok's defense is that his personal opinions didn't affect his work, but Republicans, like Chairman Gowdy, argue he showed textbook bias. This is a clash between personal integrity and professional duty, another moral aspect.

Also, the article mentions that the IG found no bias affecting prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton case, but Republicans still worry about bias in the Russian investigation. This shows a divide on whether bias had real consequences, which is another layer of moral judgment.

Strzok's attorney also points out that after a lengthy investigation, there was no evidence his views impacted his work, which counters the claims of bias affecting his job performance.

I need to make sure the summary captures these moral framings: fairness in firing, political bias in the workplace, integrity vs. personal opinions, and the impact of bias on investigations. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

Let me structure it step by step: Start with Strzok's firing, mention the political context, his attorney's claims, the FBI's response, the text messages, Trump's reaction, the IG report's findings, and the broader implications about bias and trust in institutions.

I should ensure that each moral angle is clearly presented without getting bogged down in too much detail. Also, keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any personal opinions beyond what's stated in the article.

President Trump and his allies criticized him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias, with Trump tweeting that his firing was "finally" justified.

Strzok's attorney argued that his personal views did not impact his work, and that his punishment was excessive. The firing has reignited debates about political bias within the FBI and DOJ, with some calling it a blow to public trust in these institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
