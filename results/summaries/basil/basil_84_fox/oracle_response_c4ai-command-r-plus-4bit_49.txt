SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired amid controversy over anti-Trump text messages. Strzok's attorney claims that the decision to fire Strzok was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, with FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich overruling the Office of Professional Responsibility. Strzok himself expressed sadness over the decision and claimed that his personal opinions never affected his work. President Trump cheered the firing, calling Strzok a "bad player" and claiming that the Russia case is a hoax with no collusion or obstruction. The firing comes after months of scrutiny and criticism of Strzok by Trump and his allies, who have cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the FBI. The Inspector General's report found no evidence that bias impacted prosecutorial decisions but referred five FBI employees for investigation over politically charged texts. The decision to fire Strzok has been praised by Trump's allies, who claim that Strzok damaged the FBI's reputation and exhibited textbook bias. However, Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, arguing that the deputy director reversed the decision of a career FBI official and that Strzok's punishment was excessive.
END OF SUMMARY.
