SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, an FBI official who played a key role in the Russia meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired amid accusations of anti-Trump bias. Strzok's attorney claims his client was fired due to political motivations and that his personal opinions did not affect his work. However, President Trump and his allies have cheered the decision, with the president referring to Strzok as a "bad player" and the FBI as "clowns and losers!" Strzok had previously been removed from the special counsel probe after the discovery of anti-Trump text messages exchanged with colleague Lisa Page. The firing comes after an FBI investigation and an independent review process, with the deputy director reversing the initial decision of a 60-day suspension. Strzok's attorney argues that there is no evidence that his personal views impacted his work, but the text messages and the inspector general's report suggest otherwise. The firing highlights concerns about political bias within the FBI and the potential impact on its reputation. END OF SUMMARY.
