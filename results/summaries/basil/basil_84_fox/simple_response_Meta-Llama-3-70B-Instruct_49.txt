SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired from the agency after being accused of anti-Trump bias due to text messages exchanged with colleague Lisa Page. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review process and the Deputy Director had the authority to modify the disciplinary findings. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. Strzok's firing has sparked controversy, with his attorney arguing that there is no evidence his personal views affected his work, while Trump's allies claim his conduct damaged the FBI's reputation and public trust. The moral framing of this story suggests that the firing of Strzok raises concerns about political motivations and the erosion of trust in institutions.

END OF SUMMARY.
