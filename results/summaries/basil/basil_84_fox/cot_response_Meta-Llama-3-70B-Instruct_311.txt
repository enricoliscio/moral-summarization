SUMMARY:
FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired after being accused of anti-Trump bias. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was "troubling" and "politically motivated," as it departed from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review process. President Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Strzok, tweeted "finally" and questioned whether the Russia case would be dropped, calling it a "total Hoax." Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe after exchanging anti-Trump messages with colleague Lisa Page. Republicans have raised concerns that Strzok's bias impacted the start of the Russia investigation. Strzok's conduct has "severely damaged" the FBI's reputation, and his firing has been cheered by Trump's allies. END OF SUMMARY.
