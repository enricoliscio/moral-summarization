SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired on Friday afternoon, a decision his attorney Aitan Goelman claims is a "departure from standard practice" and "politically motivated". Goelman argues that Deputy Director David Bowdich "overruled" the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove Strzok, a move that should be "deeply troubling to all Americans". Strzok's anti-Trump text messages had made him a lightning rod for political criticism, with President Trump and his allies repeatedly "hammering" him and casting him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias within the bureau. Trump tweeted "finally" in response to the news, suggesting that the Russia case may now be dropped. Strzok's attorney claims the decision is a "reversal" of the recommended 60-day suspension and demotion, and that there is no evidence his personal views affected his work. The firing has sparked controversy, with some calling it a justified punishment for Strzok's actions, while others see it as a politically motivated attack. END OF SUMMARY.
