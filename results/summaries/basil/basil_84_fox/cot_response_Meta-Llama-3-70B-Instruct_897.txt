SUMMARY:
FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims this was a departure from standard practice and politically motivated. Strzok was "deeply saddened" by the decision and launched a new Twitter account, linking to a GoFundMe page. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department. Trump tweeted, "finally," and asked whether the Russia case will now be dropped, calling it a "total Hoax." Strzok's firing has raised concerns about the FBI's reputation, with Republicans claiming that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the investigation into Russian meddling. Strzok's conduct has been labeled as "textbook bias" and has "severely damaged" public trust in the institution. END OF SUMMARY.
