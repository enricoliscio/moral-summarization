SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired from the bureau after being accused of anti-Trump bias due to text messages exchanged with colleague Lisa Page. Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, as the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion instead. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. Trump tweeted "finally" in response to the firing, suggesting that the Russia investigation may be dropped. Strzok's defenders argue that his personal opinions did not affect his work, but Republicans claim that his bias impacted the start of the Russia investigation. The firing has sparked a heated debate about political bias within the FBI and the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
