SUMMARY: 
Peter Strzok, an FBI official who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email investigations, has been fired due to anti-Trump text messages exchanged with colleague Lisa Page. This decision has been hailed by President Trump and his allies as a victory against anti-Trump bias within the bureau, with the president himself tweeting "finally." Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, arguing that his personal views never affected his work. The FBI, however, maintains that the decision was made through their standard review and disciplinary process. This incident has brought to light concerns about bias within the FBI and the potential impact on investigative decisions, with Republicans especially worried about the impartiality of the Russia investigation. The case has been morally framed with terms like "bad players," "clowns and losers," and "explosive," highlighting the intense political and ethical debate surrounding Strzok's conduct and its implications for the FBI's reputation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
