SUMMARY:
FBI official Peter Strzok, who was accused of anti-Trump bias, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was "deeply troubling" and "politically motivated," as it departed from standard practice. Strzok was a lead investigator in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, but was removed from the special counsel probe after exchanging biased text messages with colleague Lisa Page. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, calling him a "bad player" who "damaged" the FBI's "sterling reputation." Trump tweeted that Strzok's firing was "finally" a step towards justice, and questioned whether the Russia case would be dropped. Strzok's attorney argues that there is no evidence that his personal views affected his work, but Republicans claim his bias was evident in his texts. The firing has sparked a heated debate about bias and trust in the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
