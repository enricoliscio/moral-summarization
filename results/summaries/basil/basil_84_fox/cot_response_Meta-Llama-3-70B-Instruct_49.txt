SUMMARY:
FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was "deeply troubling" and "politically motivated", as it departed from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review process and the Deputy Director had the authority to modify the disciplinary findings. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Strzok, casting him as a symbol of "anti-Trump bias" within the bureau and Justice Department. Trump tweeted that Strzok's firing was "finally" a step towards correcting the "bad players" in the FBI and DOJ. Strzok's attorney argued that the decision was unjust, as there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. The controversy surrounding Strzok's texts and conduct has "severely damaged" the FBI's reputation, with many Republicans expressing "concern" over the impact of bias on the investigations.
