SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok has been fired from his position, with the decision coming as a politically motivated departure from standard practice. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, claimed that the bureau's Deputy Director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility, stating that this should be deeply troubling to all Americans. Strzok himself expressed sadness over the decision and suggested that his personal opinions never affected his work. 

President Trump and his allies have cheered the termination, casting Strzok as the face of anti-Trump bias within the FBI and Justice Department. They have pointed to text messages exchanged between Strzok and colleague Lisa Page as evidence of bias and even collusion. The text messages revealed anti-Trump sentiments and included a vow to "stop" Trump from becoming president. 

The firing comes after Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year due to the discovery of these messages. Republicans have long expressed concern about anti-Trump bias influencing the investigation into Russian meddling. The Justice Department's Inspector General found no evidence that bias impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe, but the issue has continued to be a point of contention. 

Strzok's attorney blasted the FBI, arguing that the deputy director reversed the decision of a career FBI official who had recommended a lesser punishment. The moral character of Strzok and the FBI's disciplinary process has been called into question by both sides, with Strzok's supporters and critics offering differing interpretations of his actions and their consequences.
END OF SUMMARY.
