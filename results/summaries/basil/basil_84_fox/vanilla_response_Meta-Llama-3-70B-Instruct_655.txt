SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who led investigations into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process after an inspector general report highlighted his conduct. President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Strzok, tweeted "finally" in response to the news, suggesting that the Russia case may be dropped. Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page were discovered. Republicans have raised concerns that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the Russia investigation. Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, saying the deputy director overruled a decision to give Strzok a 60-day suspension and demotion.

END OF SUMMARY.
