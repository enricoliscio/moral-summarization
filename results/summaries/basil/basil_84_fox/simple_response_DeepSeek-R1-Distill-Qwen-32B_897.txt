Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. 

First, I'll identify the main points: Strzok's role in the Russian meddling and Clinton email probes, his anti-Trump texts, the firing process, the attorney's claims, the FBI's response, and the political implications.

I should highlight the conflict between the attorney's claim of political motivation and the FBI's official stance. Also, mention the text messages and their impact on the investigation.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key events and the opposing viewpoints. Make sure to include both sides: Strzok's attorney's perspective and the FBI's explanation.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary reflects the moral framing by showing the tension between bias accusations and procedural justifications.

SUMMARY:  
FBI official Peter Strzok, who led probes into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, was fired amid allegations of anti-Trump bias. His attorney claimed the dismissal was politically motivated and departed from standard procedure, while the FBI stated it followed its disciplinary process. Strzok, who exchanged politically charged texts with colleague Lisa Page, including vows to "stop" Trump, was removed from the special counsel probe last year. Republicans, including Trump, have accused him of bias, with the president calling him part of a "witch hunt." Strzok's attorney argued his personal views did not influence his work, and no evidence of bias impacting prosecutorial decisions was found. The firing has reignited debates over political bias within the FBI and DOJ, with Trump allies celebrating the decision as a victory against anti-Trump bias. END OF SUMMARY.
