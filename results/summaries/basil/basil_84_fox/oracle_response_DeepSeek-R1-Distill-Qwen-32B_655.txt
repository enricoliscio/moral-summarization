Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should try to include as many as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI. He was involved in the Clinton email probe and the Russian meddling investigation. He had exchanged anti-Trump texts with a colleague, which led to his removal from the special counsel's team. The FBI's Deputy Director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's decision, which was to suspend and demote him, instead firing him. His attorney claims the firing was politically motivated. The article also mentions that Strzok's texts included vows to stop Trump from becoming president, which Republicans used to accuse him of bias. The IG report found no evidence that bias affected prosecutorial decisions but noted the mixing of political opinion with work. Strzok's firing was welcomed by Trump and his allies, who see it as a step towards dropping the Russia investigation, which they call a hoax. The article also mentions that more employees might face disciplinary action.

Now, I need to craft a summary using as many of the provided moral words as possible. I'll structure it to include the key points: Strzok's firing, the reasons (anti-Trump texts, overruling), the political motivation claim, the impact on the FBI's reputation, the IG findings, and the reactions from both sides.

I'll start by stating that Strzok was fired, then mention the reasons (anti-Trump texts, overruling), the political motivation, the deputy director's authority, Strzok's sadness, the hammering by Trump allies, casting him as biased, the charge of mixing politics with work, the hoax claim, and the potential for more disciplinary actions. I'll make sure to include words like departure, motivated, overruled, decision, authority, saddened, hammered, cast, fired, charge, hoax, mix, exhibited, use, try, damaged, reversed, punishment, blasting.

Putting it all together concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok was fired after being overruled by Deputy Director David Bowdich, departing from standard disciplinary practices. His attorney claimed the decision was politically motivated, reversing an initial punishment of suspension and demotion. Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump texts with colleague Lisa Page, was cast as exhibiting bias, with one text vowing to "stop" Trump. The IG report found no evidence of bias affecting prosecutorial decisions but noted politically charged messages. Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, asserting his personal views did not impact his work. Republicans, including Mark Meadows, celebrated his firing, calling it a step to repair the FBI's tarnished reputation. Trump allies see the Russia investigation as a "hoax" and hope it will be dropped. Strzok's termination may signal further disciplinary action against employees involved in politically charged texts. END OF SUMMARY.
