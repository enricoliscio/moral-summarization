SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in an inspector general report. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly criticized Strzok, accusing him of anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department. Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery of anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page. The inspector general report found no evidence that bias impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe, but Republicans have raised concerns about bias in the start of the Russian meddling investigation. Strzok's firing has been cheered by Trump's allies, who claim his conduct damaged the FBI's reputation.

END OF SUMMARY.
