SUMMARY: 
Peter Strzok, a veteran FBI official who played a key role in the Russia and Clinton email probes, has been fired after anti-Trump text messages were revealed. The firing has sparked a moral debate, with President Trump and his allies cheering the decision, while Strzok and his attorney claim it was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice. The text messages revealed Strzok's personal views and his vow to "stop" Trump from becoming president. This has raised concerns about anti-Trump bias within the FBI and has severely damaged the bureau's once sterling reputation. Republicans have torn into Strzok, accusing him of exhibiting "textbook bias." Strzok's attorney, however, defended his client, arguing that an investigation found no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. The firing has highlighted the moral concerns of many Americans about bias and integrity in law enforcement. The FBI's decision has been criticized as a departure from standard practice, with potential political motivations. This incident underscores the importance of maintaining public trust and impartiality in our justice system, and it remains to be seen what further impact this will have on the FBI's reputation.
