SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who was a key player in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email investigations, has been fired after anti-Trump text messages came to light. Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, while the FBI states that Strzok underwent the standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing, questioning whether the Russia case will now be dropped. Strzok had been removed from the special counsel probe last year after the text messages emerged, and he was later escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance. Republicans have raised concerns about anti-Trump bias influencing the Russia investigation, while Strzok defended his actions in a congressional hearing last month. Strzok's attorney maintains that his personal views never affected his work. The Justice Department has declined to comment.
END OF SUMMARY.
