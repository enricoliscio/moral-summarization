Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Peter Strzok was a key figure in both the Russian meddling investigation and the Hillary Clinton email probe. But he became controversial after his anti-Trump text messages were revealed. He's been fired, according to his attorney, Aitan Goelman, who claims the firing was politically motivated and not following standard procedures. The FBI's response says Strzok went through their standard disciplinary process, and the Deputy Director had the authority to fire him.

Strzok started a Twitter account reacting to his firing, expressing sadness and linking to a GoFundMe page. President Trump and his allies have been criticizing Strzok, calling him an example of anti-Trump bias. Trump tweeted that this was "finally" happening and questioned if the Russia case would be dropped. He also criticized Strzok and others for damaging the FBI's reputation.

Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after his texts with Lisa Page were found. They had exchanged politically charged messages. The DOJ inspector general report didn't find bias affecting prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton probe, but Republicans still believe anti-Trump bias influenced the Russia investigation. One of Strzok's texts vowed to stop Trump from becoming president.

In a congressional hearing, Strzok tried to clear his name, saying his personal opinions didn't affect his work. Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, accused him of textbook bias. His attorney argued that the punishment should have been a suspension and demotion, not firing, and that no evidence linked his views to his work.

Lisa Page left the FBI earlier this year, and the IG report referred five employees for investigation. The Justice Department didn't comment.

So, the main points are:
- Strzok's firing after anti-Trump texts were revealed.
- His attorney claims it's politically motivated.
- The FBI says it followed standard procedures.
- Trump and allies applaud the firing, seeing it as a step against anti-Trump bias.
- Strzok's texts included anti-Trump sentiments and a vow to stop Trump.
- The IG report didn't find bias affecting decisions but Republicans still have concerns.
- Strzok's attorney argues against the firing, citing lack of evidence his views impacted his work.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key events, the reactions from both sides, and the main reasons behind the firing.
