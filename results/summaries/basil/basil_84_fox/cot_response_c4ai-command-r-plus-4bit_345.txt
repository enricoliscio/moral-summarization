SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a 21-year FBI veteran who played a lead role in high-profile investigations, has been fired due to anti-Trump text messages exchanged with colleague Lisa Page. The messages revealed apparent political bias and raised concerns about the FBI's integrity. President Trump and his allies cheered the decision, casting Strzok as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and claiming he damaged the FBI's reputation. Strzok's attorney argued the decision was politically motivated and that there was no evidence of Strzok's personal views affecting his work. The Justice Department's inspector general referred five FBI employees for investigation, including Strzok, over politically charged texts. The firing has sparked debate about the role of personal bias in law enforcement and the impact on public trust in institutions. Strzok's case highlights the challenges of maintaining impartiality and professionalism in politically charged environments. 

END OF SUMMARY.
