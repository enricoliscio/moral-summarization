SUMMARY:
FBI official Peter Strzok, who led the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, has been fired after a 21-year career. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was "deeply troubling" and "politically motivated," as it departed from standard practice. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review process. President Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Strzok, tweeted "finally" and asked if the Russia case would be dropped, calling it a "total Hoax." Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe after anti-Trump text messages were discovered, and Republicans have raised concerns about bias in the investigation. Strzok's conduct has been deemed "textbook bias" by House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, and his firing has been cheered by Trump's allies. Strzok's attorney maintains that his personal views did not affect his work, but his firing has "severely damaged" public trust in the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
