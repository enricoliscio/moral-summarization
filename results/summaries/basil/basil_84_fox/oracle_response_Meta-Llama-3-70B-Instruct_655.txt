SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired from his position, a decision his attorney claims is a "departure from standard practice" and "politically motivated". Strzok was a lead investigator in both the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, but became a lightning rod after anti-Trump text messages were revealed. The FBI responded that Strzok was subject to a standard review and disciplinary process, and the Deputy Director had the authority to review and modify any disciplinary findings. President Trump and his allies have repeatedly "hammered" Strzok, casting him as a poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau. Strzok's attorney claims the decision is "deeply troubling" and that Strzok's personal views never affected his work. However, Republicans argue that Strzok's bias was evident in his text messages, including one that vowed to "stop" Trump from becoming president. Strzok's firing has been cheered by Trump's allies, who claim he "damaged" the FBI's reputation and "tarnished" public trust. END OF SUMMARY.
