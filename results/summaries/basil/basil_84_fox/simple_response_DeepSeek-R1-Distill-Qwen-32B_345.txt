Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article is quite detailed, so I should focus on the key points without getting too bogged down in specifics.

First, I'll start by identifying the main events. Strzok was fired, his attorney says it's politically motivated, and the FBI responded with their process. The text mentions his anti-Trump messages and the impact on the Russia probe. Also, there's the reaction from Trump and Republicans, and the attorney's counterpoints.

I need to make sure I include the moral aspects. The author seems to present both sides: the political angle from the attorney and the official process from the FBI. Also, the controversy around his messages and the implications for the investigations.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning his firing, the reasons given by both sides, the political context, and the reactions. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by showing the opposing viewpoints on whether it's politically motivated or a standard disciplinary action.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and captures the essence without bias. I'll need to mention the key players: Strzok, his attorney, the FBI's response, Trump's tweets, and the implications for the Russia case. Also, note that the IG found no bias affecting prosecutorial decisions but Republicans still raise concerns.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward. Make sure to include that Strzok's attorney claims the firing was overruled and politically motivated, while the FBI says it followed standard procedures. Also, mention the text messages and the impact on public trust in the FBI.

Alright, putting it all together, making sure it's under 200 words and flows logically. I'll start with the firing, then the reasons, reactions from both sides, and the implications.

SUMMARY:  
FBI official Peter Strzok, who led probes into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, was fired amid accusations of anti-Trump bias. His attorney claimed the firing was politically motivated and departed from standard procedure, while the FBI stated it followed its disciplinary process. Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump messages with colleague Lisa Page, was removed from the Russia probe last year. President Trump and Republicans have criticized him as emblematic of anti-Trump bias, with Trump tweeting that his firing was "finally" and questioning the Russia case. The DOJ inspector general found no evidence that bias affected prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe, but Republicans remain concerned. Strzok's attorney argued that his personal views did not influence his work, and no evidence of bias impacting his job was found. The firing has sparked debate over political interference and trust in the FBI.  
END OF SUMMARY.
