SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russia and Clinton email investigations, was fired for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page. Strzok's attorney claimed that the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, with FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich "overruling" the Office of Professional Responsibility. Strzok's dismissal has been cheered by President Trump and his allies, who cast Strzok as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the FBI. They argue that Strzok's personal views damaged the FBI's reputation and public trust. However, Strzok's attorney blasted the bureau, stating that Bowdich reversed the decision of a career FBI official who had recommended a lesser punishment. The text messages in question showed Strzok vowing to "stop" Trump from becoming president and expressing concern about being too tough on Clinton. The firing has raised questions about potential political bias within the FBI and whether it will impact the ongoing Russia investigation. The Justice Department declined to comment.
END OF SUMMARY.
