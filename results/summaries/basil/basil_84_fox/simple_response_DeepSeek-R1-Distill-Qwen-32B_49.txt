Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI, and his attorney claims it's politically motivated. The article mentions Strzok's anti-Trump texts and his role in the Clinton email probe. The moral framing seems to be about bias within the FBI and the impact on public trust.

I should highlight the key moral issues: Strzok's personal bias, the political implications of his firing, and the broader concerns about the FBI's integrity. I need to make sure the summary reflects these ethical concerns without taking a side, just presenting the author's framing.

I'll structure the summary by starting with Strzok's firing, mention his attorney's claims, the FBI's response, and the political reactions. Then, I'll touch on the text messages and the inspector general's report. Finally, I'll note the ongoing debate about bias and trust in the FBI.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral aspects as presented in the article. Avoiding any personal opinions, just presenting the facts with the moral angles intact.

SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who led probes into Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton's emails, was fired amid allegations of anti-Trump bias. His attorney claimed the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard procedure, while the FBI stated it followed its disciplinary process. Strzok's anti-Trump text messages with colleague Lisa Page, including vows to "stop" Trump, have been a focal point for critics, with Republicans accusing him of bias. Strzok denied his personal views influenced his work, but his firing was cheered by Trump allies, who see it as a step toward ending the Russia investigation. The FBI and DOJ have faced scrutiny over potential bias, with the inspector general finding no evidence of bias impacting prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton probe. Strzokâ€™s attorney argued his punishment was excessive and that no evidence linked his views to his work. The firing has reignited debates about trust in the FBI and political influence in law enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
