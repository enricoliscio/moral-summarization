Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article talks about Strzok's firing, his role in the Clinton and Russian probes, the anti-Trump texts, and the political implications. The moral framing seems to be around bias within the FBI, trust in institutions, and political interference. 

I need to highlight that Strzok's firing is seen by some as politically motivated, while others, like the FBI, say it's based on standard procedures. Also, the text mentions the impact on public trust and the debate over whether his personal views influenced his work.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include both sides: the political angle and the official stance. I'll also note the reactions from Trump and Republicans, as well as the counterpoints from Strzok's attorney.

Let me structure it by starting with the firing, then the reasons, reactions from both sides, and the implications for trust in the FBI. I'll make sure to mention the key points without getting too detailed, keeping it clear and balanced in terms of the moral arguments presented.

I think that's a good approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing.

SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, a key figure in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email investigations, has been fired. His attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and departed from standard procedures, while the FBI maintains it followed its disciplinary process. Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump messages with colleague Lisa Page, has been a focal point for accusations of anti-Trump bias within the bureau. President Trump and his allies have long criticized Strzok, with Trump tweeting "finally" upon his firing. Republicans argue Strzok's personal views, including a vow to "stop" Trump from becoming president, compromised the integrity of the investigations. Strzok's attorney counters that his personal opinions did not affect his work and that the FBI's decision to fire him, rather than suspend and demote him, was inappropriate. The firing has reignited debates over political bias in the FBI and its impact on public trust in the institution. END OF SUMMARY.
