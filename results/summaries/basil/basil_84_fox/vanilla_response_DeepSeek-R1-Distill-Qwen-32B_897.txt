Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Peter Strzok was a lead figure in two major probes: Russian meddling in the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton's email investigation. However, he became a political lightning rod because of anti-Trump text messages he sent. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, says he was fired on Friday, claiming it was politically motivated and not following standard procedures. Goelman also says that Deputy Director David Bowdich overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's decision, which had recommended a suspension and demotion instead of termination.

The FBI's response is that Strzok went through the standard review process after the IG report highlighted his conduct. They mention that the Deputy Director has the authority to modify disciplinary actions. Strzok himself responded by starting a new Twitter account, expressing sadness and linking to a GoFundMe page.

President Trump and his allies have been critical of Strzok, calling him a symbol of anti-Trump bias. Trump tweeted "finally" when Strzok was fired and questioned if the Russia case would be dropped. He also criticized Strzok and others for damaging the FBI's reputation.

Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after his anti-Trump messages with Lisa Page were discovered. The IG report found no evidence that bias affected prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton case, but Republicans still believe anti-Trump bias influenced the Russia investigation. Strzok's texts included a vow to stop Trump from becoming president.

In a congressional hearing, Strzok tried to defend himself, saying his personal opinions didn't affect his work, but Republicans accused him of bias. His attorney argued that his termination was unfair and that there was no evidence his views impacted his job.

The article also mentions that Lisa Page left the FBI earlier this year, and the IG report referred five employees for investigation regarding politically charged texts.

So, the main points to include in the summary are:
- Strzok's firing from the FBI.
- His role in the Russian and Clinton probes.
- The anti-Trump text messages leading to his downfall.
- His attorney's claims of political motivation and departure from standard procedures.
- The FBI's response about the disciplinary process.
- President Trump's reaction and the political implications.
- Strzok's response via Twitter and the GoFundMe link.
- The background of his removal from the special counsel probe.
- The IG report findings and Republican concerns about bias.
- The congressional hearing where Strzok defended himself.
- The potential for more disciplinary actions against other employees.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to cover the key events and reactions without getting too detailed. I should focus on the main actions and reactions, avoiding secondary details unless they're crucial to the summary.

Let me structure the summary step by step:
1. Introduction: Strzok fired, his roles in probes.
2. Reason for firing: anti-Trump texts, political controversy.
3. Attorney's claims: politically motivated, overruling of OPR.
4. FBI's response: standard review process, Deputy Director's authority.
5. Strzok's response: Twitter and GoFundMe.
6. Background: removal from special counsel probe, IG report findings.
7. Republican concerns and Trump's reaction.
8. Congressional hearing and attorney's defense.
9. Potential for more disciplinary actions.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.
