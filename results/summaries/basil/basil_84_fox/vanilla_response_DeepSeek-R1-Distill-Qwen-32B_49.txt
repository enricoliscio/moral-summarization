Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Peter Strzok was a key figure in both the Russian meddling investigation and the Hillary Clinton email probe. He became a political lightning rod because of his anti-Trump text messages. He was fired, and his attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and not following standard procedures.

The FBI's response says that Strzok went through their standard review process after the IG report highlighted his conduct. The Deputy Director had the authority to make the final decision. Strzok is upset and has a Twitter account and a GoFundMe page.

President Trump and his allies have been criticizing Strzok, calling him a symbol of anti-Trump bias. Trump even asked if the Russia case would be dropped now. The article also mentions that Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year because of his texts with Lisa Page, who is his colleague and lover. The IG report found no bias affecting prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton case, but Republicans are still concerned about bias in the Russia investigation.

Strzok tried to defend himself in a congressional hearing, saying his personal opinions didn't affect his work, but Republicans accused him of bias. His attorney argues that the punishment was too harsh and that there's no evidence his views impacted his job. The Justice Department didn't comment.

Text messages showed Strzok and Page discussing politics and criticizing Trump. Some messages also showed concern about being too tough on Clinton. The IG report referred five employees for investigation, and Lisa Page left the FBI earlier this year.

Putting this all together, the summary should include the main points: Strzok's role, his firing, the reasons given by both sides, Trump's reaction, the context of the text messages, and the implications for the investigations. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all the essential information without getting too detailed.

I should structure it by starting with the firing, then the context of his role, the controversy over the texts, the reactions from both sides, and the implications. I'll need to mention the political implications, the FBI's response, and the broader context of bias allegations.

Let me draft a few sentences to cover each point without overlapping. Make sure to include key terms like "anti-Trump bias," "Russia investigation," "Hillary Clinton email probe," and the reactions from Trump and the attorney. Also, note that the IG found no bias affecting decisions but Republicans still have concerns.

I think that's a solid outline. Now, I'll put it all together in a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well.
