Okay, so the user has given me a news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. They want a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. I need to make sure I include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Strzok was fired, his attorney claims it's politically motivated, the FBI says it followed standard procedures. There's a lot about the text messages, the Russia probe, and the political bias accusations.

I need to identify the key morally charged words from the list provided. Words like "departure," "motivated," "overruled," "decision," "authority," "saddened," "hammered," "cast," "fired," "charge," "hoax," "collusion," "obstruction," "fight," "mix," "stop," "exhibited," "use," "try," "damaged," "reversed," "punishment," "blasting," "called," "action."

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Start with Strzok's firing, mention the attorney's claims, the FBI's response, the political context, and the reactions from Trump and others.

I need to keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral implications without going into too much detail. Make sure each sentence includes a morally framed word where it fits naturally.

Let me draft a few sentences:

1. Peter Strzok, an FBI official, was fired, with his attorney claiming it was a politically motivated departure from standard practice.
2. The FBI countered, stating the decision followed their disciplinary process, but the attorney blasted the bureau for reversing the initial punishment.
3. Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump messages, leading Trump and his allies to hammer him as an example of anti-Trump bias.
4. The firing was cheered by Trump's allies, who saw it as a step towards dropping the Russia case, which they called a hoax.
5. Strzok's attorney argued that his personal views didn't affect his work, but Republicans exhibited concern over bias impacting the Clinton probe.
6. The inspector general found no evidence of bias affecting prosecutorial decisions, but the damage to the FBI's reputation remained a concern.

I should check the word count and ensure all key points are covered with the moral framing intact. Maybe combine some sentences to stay within 200 words. Also, ensure that each morally framed word is used contextually correctly.

Let me refine it:

Peter Strzok, an FBI official, was fired, with his attorney claiming it was a politically motivated departure from standard practice. The FBI stated the decision followed their disciplinary process, but the attorney blasted the bureau for reversing the initial punishment. Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump messages, leading Trump and his allies to hammer him as an example of anti-Trump bias. The firing was cheered by Trump's allies, who saw it as a step towards dropping the Russia case, which they called a hoax. Strzok's attorney argued that his personal views didn't affect his work, but Republicans exhibited concern over bias impacting the Clinton probe. The inspector general found no evidence of bias affecting prosecutorial decisions, but the damage to the FBI's reputation remained a concern.

That's concise and includes many of the morally framed words. I think this meets the user's requirements.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, an FBI official embroiled in controversy over anti-Trump text messages, was fired in a decision that his attorney called a politically motivated departure from standard practice. Strzok’s attorney claimed the FBI Deputy Director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility, which had recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion. The FBI defended the decision, stating it followed its disciplinary process. Strzok, who had exchanged politically charged messages with colleague Lisa Page, was cast as a symbol of anti-Trump bias by President Trump and his allies. Trump celebrated the firing, questioning whether the Russia probe would now be dropped, calling it a "hoax." Strzok’s attorney blasted the bureau, arguing his client’s personal views did not affect his work. Republicans, however, exhibited concern over potential bias in the Clinton email probe, though an inspector general report found no evidence of bias impacting prosecutorial decisions. Strzok’s firing was cheered by Trump’s allies, who saw it as a step toward restoring public trust in the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
