Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to understand the key points. The main subject is Peter Strzok, an FBI official who was fired. The article mentions his role in the Russian meddling and Clinton email probes, which are significant. He's a lightning rod because of anti-Trump texts, which shows some bias.

I notice that the user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words. I'll scan the article for words that carry moral connotations. Words like "lightning rod," "anti-Trump," "overruled," "troubling," "bias," "clowns," "losers," "witch hunt," "hoax," "collusion," "obstruction," "bad players," "damaged," "tarnished," "sterling," "trust," "concern," "abuse," "integrity," "misconduct," "fairness," "transparency," "justified," "righteous," "betrayal," "disgrace," "abhorrent," "dishonest," "unprofessional," "inappropriate," "corruption," "abuse," "integrity," "misconduct," "fairness," "transparency," "justified," "righteous," "betrayal," "disgrace," "abhorrent," "dishonest," "unprofessional," "inappropriate," "corruption." I'll list these as per the user's instruction.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating that Peter Strzok was fired, noting his role in the probes and the controversy around his texts. I'll mention the attorney's claims of political motivation and the FBI's response about standard procedures. I'll include the political reactions, especially from Trump and Republicans, highlighting their accusations of bias. I'll also note the IG report's findings and the lack of evidence linking bias to prosecutorial decisions. Finally, I'll mention the broader implications for the FBI and DOJ, emphasizing trust and integrity.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it too lengthy. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the firing, the reasons given, reactions, and the broader impact. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

### SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, a key figure in the FBI's Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email investigations, was fired amid accusations of anti-Trump bias. His attorney claimed the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard procedures, while the FBI defended the decision as part of its disciplinary process. Strzok had exchanged politically charged messages with colleague Lisa Page, including vows to "stop" Trump from becoming president. Republicans criticized him as a symbol of anti-Trump bias, with Trump himself calling the FBI's handling of the Russia probe a "witch hunt" and a "hoax." The inspector general's report found no evidence that bias influenced prosecutorial decisions, but Republicans remain skeptical. Strzok's firing has reignited debates about trust, integrity, and fairness within the FBI and DOJ, with some viewing it as a victory against corruption and others as a politically motivated move. END OF SUMMARY.
