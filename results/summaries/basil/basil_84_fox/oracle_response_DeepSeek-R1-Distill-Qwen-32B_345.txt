Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user provided a list of morally charged words that were used in the article, and I need to make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Strzok was fired, his attorney says it's politically motivated, the FBI says it followed standard procedures. Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump texts, which led to his removal from the special counsel's probe. The IG report found no bias affecting prosecutorial decisions, but Republicans are concerned about anti-Trump bias. Strzok tried to defend himself in a congressional hearing, but Republicans criticized him. Trump and his allies are happy about his firing, calling it a positive step.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list: departure, motivated, overruled, decision, authority, saddened, hammered, cast, fired, charge, hoax, collusion, obstruction, fight, mix, stop, exhibited, use, try, damaged, reversed, punishment, blasting, called, action.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. For example, his attorney says it's a departure from standard practice and politically motivated. The FBI overruled the OPR's decision. Strzok was saddened by the firing. Trump and allies hammered him, casting him as biased. The firing was charged as politically motivated. The Russia case was called a hoax. Strzok tried to stop Trump. His texts exhibited bias. His attorney blasted the FBI. The IG report referred to action against employees.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of these words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start by stating his firing, mention the attorney's claims, the FBI's response, the context of the anti-Trump texts, the IG report, the congressional hearing, Trump's reaction, and the implications for the FBI's reputation.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include the moral words naturally. I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate the words from the list. For example, "FBI official Peter Strzok was fired, with his attorney claiming the decision was a politically motivated departure from standard practice." That uses "fired," "motivated," and "departure."

I'll continue, making sure each key point is covered with the appropriate moral framing words. I'll avoid going into too much detail, keeping it brief but comprehensive. I'll also ensure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content and the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok was fired, with his attorney claiming the decision was a politically motivated departure from standard practice. The FBI stated that Deputy Director David Bowdich overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation, leading to Strzok's removal. Strzok expressed sadness over the firing, while President Trump and his allies celebrated, calling it a positive step. Strzok had been involved in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes but became controversial due to anti-Trump text messages. The Inspector General's report found no bias impacting prosecutorial decisions but highlighted concerns about politically charged messages. Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after his texts were revealed. His attorney blasted the FBI, stating that the deputy director reversed the decision, which should have resulted in a 60-day suspension and demotion. Republicans criticized Strzok, claiming his conduct tarnished the FBI's reputation and damaged public trust. The firing was seen as a step toward addressing anti-Trump bias within the bureau. END OF SUMMARY.
