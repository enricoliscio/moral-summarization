SUMMARY: FBI official Peter Strzok, who was involved in the Russia and Hillary Clinton email investigations, has been fired following the revelation of anti-Trump text messages. Strzok's attorney claims the firing was politically motivated and a departure from standard practice, while the FBI asserts that the decision was made through the standard review and disciplinary process. President Trump celebrated the firing, tweeting that Strzok was the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the FBI and DOJ. Strzok had previously been removed from the special counsel probe due to his exchange of politically charged messages with colleague Lisa Page. The text messages raised concerns about potential anti-Trump bias influencing the Russia investigation. Strzok defended his actions in a congressional hearing, but Republicans maintained that his conduct exhibited bias. The FBI's decision to fire Strzok has been praised by Trump's allies and criticized by Strzok's attorney, who claims his personal views did not affect his work. The inspector general report referred five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, suggesting more disciplinary action may be considered.
END OF SUMMARY.
