SUMMARY:

FBI official Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, a decision his attorney claims is a "departure" from standard practice and "politically motivated". Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, said Deputy Director David Bowdich "overruled" the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him, a move that should be "deeply troubling" to all Americans. Strzok, who played a lead role in the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes, was accused of having anti-Trump bias after the revelation of text messages. President Trump and his allies have "hammered" Strzok, casting him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department. Trump tweeted, "finally", and asked whether the Russia case will now be dropped, calling it a "total Hoax". Strzok's firing has sparked a heated debate, with Republicans cheering the decision and Democrats claiming it's a "reversed" punishment. The controversy surrounding Strzok's conduct has "damaged" the FBI's reputation, with many questioning whether his personal opinions affected his work.

END OF SUMMARY.
