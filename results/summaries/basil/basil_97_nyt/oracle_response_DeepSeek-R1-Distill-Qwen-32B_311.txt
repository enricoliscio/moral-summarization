Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which aims to address corruption, voting rights, and ethics. Key points include:

1. The legislation passed with a large majority, fulfilling a campaign promise.
2. It includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and ethics rules.
3. Republicans are opposing it, branding it as a power grab and a threat to election integrity.
4. The bill also targets the President's tax returns and federal spending on his properties.
5. There's criticism from both sides about potential First Amendment infringements.
6. The bill is seen as a campaign tool for 2020 but has little chance in the Senate.

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words: dismantle, end, impose, makes, broken, tear, branded, takeover, undermine, interests, infringe, prohibit, being, spent, hold, violations, failed, put, divide, tar, allowing, diminishes, ambushed, held.

I should structure the summary to include these words while keeping it concise. I'll start by mentioning the passage of the bill, using "dismantle barriers" and "end big money." Then, touch on the Republican opposition with "branded" and "takeover." Highlight the provisions about tax returns and federal spending, using "prohibit" and "hold." Also, mention the criticism about infringing on rights and the political maneuvering, using "ambushed" and "held." Finally, conclude with the bill's significance as a campaign tool despite Senate opposition.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, including as many of the specified words as possible without making it forced. Let me draft it step by step, checking each point and the moral words to include.

SUMMARY: The House passed the For the People Act, a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill aimed at dismantling barriers to voting, ending big money in politics, and imposing stricter ethics rules. Republicans branded the bill a "power grab" and "takeover," arguing it undermines election integrity. The legislation includes provisions to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register voters, and prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or vice president. It also requires presidents and candidates to release 10 years of tax returns. Democrats argue the bill holds leaders accountable for ethical violations, but critics say it infringes on First Amendment rights. Republicans have tried to divide the caucus and tar the bill, but Democrats held steady, rejecting attempts to diminish the legislation's integrity. The bill, which has little chance in the Senate, reflects Democrats' campaign promise to clean up Washington and serves as a platform for 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
