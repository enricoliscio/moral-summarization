SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The legislation, passed 234-193, makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington and serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. However, it has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. Republicans have branded it the "Democrat Politician Protection Act" and criticized it as a "massive federal government takeover" that would "undermine the integrity of our elections." The bill aims to reveal who funds online political ads and finances dark-money groups, and includes provisions to prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president or administration officials. Democrats argue that cleanup must start with the White House, citing alleged ethical abuses. The legislation holds government leaders to the highest standards, addressing high-profile ethics violations and failed accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
