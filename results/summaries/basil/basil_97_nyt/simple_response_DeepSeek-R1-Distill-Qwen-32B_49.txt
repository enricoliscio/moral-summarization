Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They want it in a specific format, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, the summary should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which is a significant piece of legislation aimed at anti-corruption and voting rights. It includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and stricter ethics rules. 

I notice the moral framing here is about democracy, fairness, and accountability. The Democrats are positioning this as empowering the people against big money and corruption, which is a positive moral stance. On the flip side, Republicans are opposing it, calling it a power grab and a threat to election integrity, which is their moral argument.

I should make sure to include both perspectives in the summary. Also, the article mentions the bill's chances in the Senate are slim, which is an important point about its political feasibility. 

I need to condense all this into a concise summary without losing the essence of the moral arguments from both sides. I'll start by stating the passage of the bill, its main provisions, the Democratic stance, Republican opposition, and the political implications. 

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the bill's passage, its goals, the opposing views, and the political dynamics. That should cover all the key points while maintaining the moral framing as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The House passed the For the People Act, a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill, aimed at reducing barriers to voting, limiting big money in politics, and enforcing stricter ethics on federal officials. The legislation, which includes provisions like making Election Day a federal holiday and requiring transparency in political spending, is seen by Democrats as a step toward restoring democracy and accountability. However, Republicans oppose the bill, branding it as a power grab and a threat to election integrity. The bill also targets the Trump administration, requiring presidents and candidates to release tax returns and banning federal funds for businesses owned by officials. While Democrats argue the measures are necessary to curb special interest influence, conservatives and liberals alike criticize some provisions as infringing on First Amendment rights. Despite its symbolic importance for Democrats, the bill faces little chance of passing the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
