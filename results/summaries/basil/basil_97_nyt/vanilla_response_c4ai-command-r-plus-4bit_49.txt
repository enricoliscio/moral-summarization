SUMMARY: The House of Representatives passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill known as the For the People Act. The bill aims to increase voter access, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The bill includes provisions such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to those who have served felony sentences. It also includes measures to increase transparency in political advertising and require the disclosure of dark money group donors. The bill has been criticized by Republicans as a power grab and is unlikely to pass the Senate. The bill also includes several provisions targeting the alleged ethical abuses of the Trump administration, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking government officials. Democrats also successfully defeated a Republican attempt to include language allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote.
END OF SUMMARY.
