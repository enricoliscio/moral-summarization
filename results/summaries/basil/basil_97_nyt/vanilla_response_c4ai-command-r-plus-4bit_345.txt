SUMMARY: The US House of Representatives passed a Democratic bill aimed at tackling corruption, protecting voting rights, and reducing the influence of big money in politics. The bill, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, includes provisions such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences. The bill also aims to increase transparency in political donations and advertising, requiring super PACs and nonprofit organizations to disclose donors who contribute over $10,000. Additionally, it includes measures to address ethical concerns within the White House, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. The bill passed with a vote of 234-193, but it is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to block it.
END OF SUMMARY.
