SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The bill, dubbed the "For the People Act," makes good on Democrats' campaign pledge to clean up Washington and serves as a platform for the 2020 elections. While it has virtually no chance of passing the Senate, the legislation is a powerful statement of Democrats' commitment to democracy and accountability. The bill includes provisions to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. It also aims to reveal who funds online political ads and finances dark-money groups. Democrats argue that the bill is necessary to address the undue influence of special interests in politics and to hold government leaders to the highest standards.
