SUMMARY: The US House of Representatives passed the Democrats' flagship anti-corruption and voting rights bill, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, by a vote of 234-193. The bill aims to remove barriers to voting, limit the influence of big money in politics, and enforce stricter ethical standards on federal officials. While it is unlikely to pass the Senate, the bill includes provisions such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, restoring voting rights to felons, and creating a public campaign funding system. The bill also targets dark money in politics and includes measures to increase transparency around political ad funding. Additionally, it addresses ethical concerns in the White House, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Democrats also fended off a Republican attempt to associate the bill with allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote.

END OF SUMMARY.
