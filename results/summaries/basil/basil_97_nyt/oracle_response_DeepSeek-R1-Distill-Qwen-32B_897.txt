Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the House passing the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, H.R. 1. It's a big bill aiming to remove barriers to voting, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and enforce stricter ethics on federal officials. It passed 234-193, which is a majority, but it's unlikely to pass the Senate.

The author uses words like "dismantle," "end," "impose," "makes," "broken," "tear," "branded," "takeover," "undermine," "interests," "infringe," "prohibit," "being," "spent," "hold," "violations," "failed," "put," "divide," "tar," "allowing," "diminishes," "ambushed," "held." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The bill includes making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a donation matching system. Republicans are against it, calling it a power grab and a takeover. They argue it's a government overreach and infringes on rights.

Democrats emphasize holding leaders accountable, especially targeting the Trump administration's ethics issues. They require tax returns and prohibit federal funds at businesses owned by officials. Republicans tried to divide the caucus but failed.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: the bill's goals, passage details, Republican opposition, key provisions, and the ethical focus on the administration. I need to make sure to use the moral words to maintain the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes the key morally framed terms.

SUMMARY: The House passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, H.R. 1, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics on federal officials. The bill, which passed 234-193, includes provisions like designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a six-to-one donation matching system. Republicans branded the bill as a "power grab" and "federal government takeover," arguing it undermines election integrity and infringes on First Amendment rights. The legislation also targets the Trump administration, requiring presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds at businesses owned by officials. Democrats emphasized holding leaders accountable, as the bill addresses high-profile ethics violations, which they argue the government has failed to address. Republicans attempted to divide the caucus but failed, as Democrats held steady. The bill, while unlikely to pass the Senate, serves as a campaign platform for the 2020 elections. END OF SUMMARY.
