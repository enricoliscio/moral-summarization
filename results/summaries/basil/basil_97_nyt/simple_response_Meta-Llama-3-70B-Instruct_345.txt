SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a vote of 234-193. The bill aims to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes provisions to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also targets dark money groups and online political ads, requiring disclosure of donors who contribute over $10,000. Democrats argue that the bill is a "power grab for the American people," while Republicans have criticized it as a "massive federal government takeover" that would undermine election integrity. The bill has virtually no chance of passing the Senate, but serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020.
