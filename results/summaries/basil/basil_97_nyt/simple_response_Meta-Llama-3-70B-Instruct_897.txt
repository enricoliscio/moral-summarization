SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a 234-193 vote. The sweeping bill aims to increase transparency in politics, reduce the influence of big money, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes provisions to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also targets dark money in politics and requires disclosure of donors who contribute over $10,000 to super PACs and nonprofit organizations. Democrats see this legislation as a crucial step in cleaning up Washington and promoting democracy, while Republicans have criticized it as a "power grab" and a "federal government takeover" that undermines election integrity. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, but it serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of the 2020 elections.
