SUMMARY:
The House passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The legislation, dubbed the "For the People Act," makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington and serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. It includes proposals to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also aims to reveal who funds online political ads and finances dark-money groups, and to hold government leaders to the highest standards. Republicans have criticized the legislation, calling it a "massive federal government takeover" that would "undermine the integrity of our elections." END OF SUMMARY.
