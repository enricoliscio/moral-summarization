SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The bill, dubbed the "For the People Act," makes good on Democrats' campaign pledge to clean up Washington and serves as a campaign platform for 2020. However, it has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. Republicans have branded the bill a "power grab" and a "takeover" that would undermine the integrity of elections. The legislation includes provisions to reveal who funds online political ads, require presidents to release tax returns, and prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or officials. Democrats argue that cleanup must start with the White House, citing alleged ethical abuses. The bill's passage is seen as a victory for Democrats, who held steady against Republican attempts to divide and tar the legislation.
