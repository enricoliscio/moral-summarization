SUMMARY: This showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation passed in the House aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box and end big money in politics. The sweeping and expansive bill serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020, but has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. It includes ambitious provisions to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to felons. The bill also targets the influence of big money in politics by creating a matching system for small donations and imposing additional fines on corporations. Republicans have criticized and tried to define and tear down the legislation, branding it as a "power grab." Meanwhile, Democrats argue that it addresses the undue influence of special interests and promotes transparency. The bill also takes aim at the ethics of the White House, requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting spending federal funds at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Despite attempts by Republicans to divide the Democratic caucus and tar the legislation, the party held steady in support of their signature bill.
END OF SUMMARY.
