SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting and end big money in politics. The sweeping bill imposes stricter ethics rules on federal officials and makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington. However, it has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. Republicans have branded the bill a "power grab" and a "takeover" that would undermine the integrity of elections. Democrats argue that the bill is necessary to reveal who funds online political ads and finances dark-money groups, and to hold government leaders to the highest standards. The bill would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or cabinet officials, and require presidents and vice presidents to release their tax returns. Democrats successfully put down a Republican attempt to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution on illegal immigrants' voting rights. The bill is a key campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
