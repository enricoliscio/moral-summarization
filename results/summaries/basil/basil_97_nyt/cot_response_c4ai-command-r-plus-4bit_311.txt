SUMMARY: The House passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box and end big money in politics. The bill, called the For the People Act, includes proposals to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to felons. It also creates a system to match small donations to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high-dollar contributions. The bill has been criticized by Republicans as a massive federal government takeover that undermines the integrity of elections and is unlikely to pass the Senate. 

Democrats have used the legislation to address ethical abuses in the White House, including requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or vice president. The bill also includes provisions to reveal the financing of so-called dark-money groups and to hold government leaders to higher ethical standards. 

Despite attacks from the opposition, Democrats held steady in their support for the bill, which they see as a campaign pledge to clean up Washington and an important step in addressing the undue influence of special interests in politics. 

END OF SUMMARY.
