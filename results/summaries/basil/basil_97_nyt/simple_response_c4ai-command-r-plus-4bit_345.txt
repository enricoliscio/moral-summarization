SUMMARY: The House passed the Democrats' comprehensive anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, which aims to remove barriers to voting, curb big money in politics, and enforce stricter ethical standards on federal officials. The bill includes proposals such as making Election Day a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences. It also addresses online political ad funding and dark money groups, requiring disclosure of donors who contribute more than $10,000. The bill takes aim at the White House's ethical abuses, mandating the release of tax returns and transparency in spending. Democrats united behind the bill despite Republican efforts to define it as a power grab and tar it with controversial amendments. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, but it serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020, showcasing their commitment to cleaning up Washington and upholding ethical standards in government.
END OF SUMMARY.
