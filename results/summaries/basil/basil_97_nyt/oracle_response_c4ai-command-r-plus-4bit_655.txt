SUMMARY: The House Democrats passed an expansive anti-corruption and voting rights bill that aims to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on officials. The bill, called the For the People Act, includes provisions such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to felons. It also creates a matching system for small donations to congressional and presidential candidates and imposes new rules on dark money groups. The bill has been criticized by Republicans as a power grab and has been branded as the “Democrat Politician Protection Act” by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Some provisions have also been criticized for potentially infringing on First Amendment rights. The bill also targets the White House, including requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or vice president. Despite the bill's ambitious goals, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate. House Democrats held steady against Republican attempts to divide their caucus and passed the bill, delivering on a campaign pledge to clean up Washington.
