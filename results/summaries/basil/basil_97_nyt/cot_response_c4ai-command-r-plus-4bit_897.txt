SUMMARY: 
The House passed the Democrats' showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, which aims to dismantle barriers to voting and get big money out of politics. The sweeping legislation, passed 234-193, includes proposals to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to those who have served felony sentences. It also creates stricter ethics rules for federal officials and aims to end the undue influence of special interests in politics. While the bill has virtually no chance of passing the Senate, it serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. Republicans have criticized the legislation as a massive federal government takeover that undermines the integrity of elections and have branded it as a "Democrat Politician Protection Act." Some provisions in the bill have been criticized for potentially infringing on First Amendment rights and being overly broad. The legislation also includes several provisions targeting ethical abuses in the White House, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Despite these criticisms, Democrats held steady and successfully passed their signature legislation.
