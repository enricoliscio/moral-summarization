SUMMARY: The House Democrats passed sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation that aims to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The bill, called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, includes proposals such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to felons. It also creates a matching system for small donations to congressional and presidential candidates and imposes new rules on super PACs and dark-money groups. The bill has been criticized by Republicans, who argue that it is a federal government takeover that would undermine election integrity. Some provisions have also been criticized for potentially infringing on First Amendment rights. The legislation includes several provisions targeting ethical abuses in the White House, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Despite facing obstacles in the Senate and criticism from Republicans, House Democrats held firm and passed the bill, demonstrating their commitment to cleaning up Washington and protecting the voting rights of citizens.
