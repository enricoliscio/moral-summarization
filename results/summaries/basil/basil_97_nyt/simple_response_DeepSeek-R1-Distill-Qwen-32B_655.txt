Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which is a Democratic bill aiming to address corruption, voting rights, and ethics. The author presents it as a significant move by Democrats to fulfill their campaign promises and set the stage for the 2020 election. The bill includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and ethics reforms targeting the Trump administration. It also has provisions to limit the influence of big money in politics through donation matching and disclosure requirements.

On the other hand, Republicans are opposing it, calling it a power grab and a threat to election integrity. They've been criticizing the bill, and some groups argue it infringes on First Amendment rights. The article also mentions that the bill has little chance in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans.

The moral framing here seems to highlight the Democrats' efforts to increase transparency, fairness, and reduce corruption, while Republicans are portrayed as obstructing these efforts, possibly for their own political gain. The author seems to support the idea of reform but also acknowledges the political battle and the challenges the bill faces.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the Democratic perspective as a positive reform and the Republican opposition as obstructionist. Also, keeping it under 200 words and ending with the specified tokens.

I should structure the summary to first mention the passage of the bill, its main aims, the Democratic support and their reasons, then the Republican opposition and their criticisms. Finally, note the bill's chances in the Senate and the overall political context.

Let me draft that, making sure to include the key elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The House passed the For the People Act, a sweeping Democratic bill aimed at combating corruption, expanding voting rights, and imposing stricter ethics on federal officials. The legislation includes provisions like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and limiting the influence of big money in politics through a donation matching system. Democrats view it as a campaign promise fulfilled and a platform for the 2020 election, while Republicans criticize it as a power grab and a threat to election integrity. The bill, which has little chance of passing the Senate, also targets the Trump administration with ethics reforms, such as requiring presidents to release tax returns and banning federal funds for businesses owned by top officials. Republicans have opposed the bill, branding it as a "Democrat Politician Protection Act" and arguing it infringes on First Amendment rights. The legislation reflects a broader debate over the role of money and transparency in politics, with Democrats emphasizing the need for reform and Republicans framing it as an overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
