Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which aims to tackle corruption and voting rights. It includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and ethics rules. Republicans oppose it, calling it a power grab and a government takeover. The bill also targets dark money in politics and includes provisions about tax returns and federal funds for the president's businesses. The summary needs to highlight the moral aspects using words like "dismantle," "end," "impose," etc.

I should structure the summary to first mention the passage of the bill, its goals, and the opposition. Then touch on the specific provisions and the ethical issues it addresses. Make sure to include the morally charged words without making it sound forced. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word fits naturally into the context.

SUMMARY: The House passed the For the People Act, a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill aimed at dismantling barriers to voting, ending big money in politics, and imposing stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The legislation, which makes good on Democrats' campaign promises, includes provisions like designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to those with felony sentences. It also creates a six-to-one matching system for small donations to candidates who reject large contributions. Republicans have branded the bill a "power grab" and a "federal government takeover," arguing it undermines election integrity. The bill also seeks to reveal donors behind online ads and dark-money groups, though some provisions have drawn criticism for potentially infringing on First Amendment rights. Democrats emphasize holding government leaders to the highest standards, targeting alleged ethical abuses in the Trump administration, such as requiring presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or vice president. Despite Republican efforts to divide and tar the legislation, Democrats held steady in support. END OF SUMMARY.
