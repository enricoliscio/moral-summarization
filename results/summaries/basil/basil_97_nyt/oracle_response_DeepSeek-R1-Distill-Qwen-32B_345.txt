Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which is a big bill aimed at anti-corruption and voting rights. The author used specific morally charged words like "dismantle," "end," "impose," etc., so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The House passed H.R. 1, which aims to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules. It includes making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a donation matching system. Republicans are against it, calling it a power grab and a government takeover. They argue it undermines election integrity and infringes on First Amendment rights. The bill also targets the president's ethics, requiring tax returns and prohibiting federal funds at his businesses. Some provisions are controversial, and there were attempts to divide the Democrats but they held together.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral words. I'll start by stating the House passed the bill, using "dismantle," "end," and "impose." Then mention the provisions, using "automatically registering," "restore," "six-to-one matching," "funded by fines." Then talk about Republican opposition, using "brand," "massive takeover," "undermine," "infringe." Then mention the controversial parts about dark money and First Amendment. Next, the focus on the president, using "require," "release tax returns," "prohibit," "spent." Finally, note the criticism and the Democrats holding together, using "hold," "violations," "failed," "ambushed," "held."

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral framing words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The House passed the For the People Act, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules. The legislation includes provisions like designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, restoring voting rights for felons, and a six-to-one matching system for small donations, funded by fines on corporations. Republicans branded the bill a "massive federal government takeover," arguing it undermines election integrity and infringes on First Amendment rights. The bill also targets dark money in politics, requiring super PACs and nonprofits to disclose donors contributing over $10,000. It includes provisions to hold government leaders accountable, requiring presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds at businesses owned by officials. Despite criticism from both sides, Democrats held firm, rejecting attempts to divide them and tar the legislation. The bill reflects their commitment to cleaning up Washington but faces an uphill battle in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
