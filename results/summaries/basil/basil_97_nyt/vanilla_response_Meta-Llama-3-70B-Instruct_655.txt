SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a vote of 234-193. The bill aims to increase access to voting, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes provisions to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also targets dark money groups and online political ads, requiring disclosure of donors who contribute over $10,000. However, the legislation has little chance of passing the Senate, with Republican leaders criticizing it as a "power grab" and a "federal government takeover." Democrats see the bill as a key campaign platform for 2020 and a fulfillment of their promise to "clean up Washington."
