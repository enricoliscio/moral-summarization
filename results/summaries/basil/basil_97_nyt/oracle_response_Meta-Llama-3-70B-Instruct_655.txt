SUMMARY:

The House passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting and end big money in politics. The bill, with virtually no chance of passing the Senate, imposes stricter ethics rules on federal officials and makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington. It includes proposals to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The legislation also targets dark-money groups, requiring them to disclose donors who contribute over $10,000. Democrats argue that such disclosure is broadly popular with voters, while critics claim it infringes on First Amendment rights. The bill also takes aim at the White House, requiring presidents and vice presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or officials. Democrats held steady against Republican attempts to divide the caucus and tar the legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
