SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a vote of 234-193. The sweeping bill aims to expand voting rights, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The legislation includes provisions to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. It also creates a system to match small donations to congressional and presidential candidates and requires disclosure of donors to online political ads and dark-money groups. The bill has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledging not to take up the legislation.

END OF SUMMARY.
