Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which is a big bill aimed at anti-corruption and voting rights. The Democrats are pushing it as a way to clean up politics, make voting easier, and limit big money influence. They passed it 234-193, but it's unlikely to pass the Senate. The bill includes things like Election Day as a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a donation matching system funded by fines on corporations. 

Republicans are against it, calling it a power grab and a government takeover. They've been trying to define it as a Democrat Politician Protection Act, which sounds like it's protecting their interests. The bill also includes provisions to make political ad funding more transparent, which Democrats say is popular but some groups argue it infringes on free speech. 

Additionally, the bill targets the Trump administration, requiring tax returns from presidents and vice presidents, and prohibits federal funds from being used for their businesses. There are also measures about travel expenses, making sure the government isn't spending money on the president's properties. 

The article mentions that the Democrats are holding the line against Republican attempts to divide them, especially on issues like illegal immigrants voting, which they see as a tactic to undermine the bill. The summary needs to capture the moral stance, so I should highlight the Democrats' goals of anti-corruption and expanding voting rights, contrast it with Republicans' criticisms, and mention the specific provisions that target the administration.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements: the bill's passage, its main components, Republican opposition, and the moral implications from both sides. I should make sure to include the positive framing from Democrats and the negative framing from Republicans to preserve the moral aspects.

Let me structure it: Start with the House passing the bill, its goals, mention key provisions, then Republican opposition and their framing, and end with the Democrats' stance on accountability and the challenges they face.

I think that covers the main points while maintaining the moral framing. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's concise and within the word limit.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the For the People Act, a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill, with Democrats framing it as a move to democratize politics and reduce special interest influence. The legislation includes provisions like Election Day as a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a donation matching system funded by corporate fines. It also targets political transparency by requiring disclosure of donors to super PACs and nonprofits, though some argue this infringes on free speech. The bill further mandates presidential tax returns and prohibits federal funds for the president's businesses, addressing ethics concerns. Republicans criticized the bill as a government overreach, branding it as self-serving for Democrats. Despite opposition, Democrats remain united, emphasizing the need for accountability and integrity in governance. The bill, however, faces an uphill battle in the Senate.
