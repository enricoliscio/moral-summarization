Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the House passing the For the People Act. They specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." and be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I need to read the article thoroughly to understand the key points. The article talks about the House passing this legislation, which is a major Democratic initiative aimed at anti-corruption and voting rights. It includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and ethics rules for federal officials. 

I should note that the bill has a long list of provisions, such as the Disclose Act, which requires political groups to disclose donors. There's also the part about requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns, which targets Trump since he hasn't done that. Additionally, the bill includes measures to prevent federal funds from being used at the president's businesses.

The article mentions Republican opposition, branding it as a power grab and a socialist takeover. McConnell and McCarthy are against it, and it's unlikely to pass the Senate. There's also some internal debate within the Democratic caucus, but they managed to keep it together.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary. I should highlight the main points: the bill's passage, its goals, key provisions, Republican opposition, and the challenges it faces in the Senate. I should make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

Let me start by stating the bill's passage, then outline its objectives, mention the major provisions, note the Republican criticism, and conclude with the bill's prospects. I'll need to be brief but comprehensive, ensuring each key element is included without going into too much detail.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and is easy to understand. Maybe start with the passage, then the purpose, followed by specific measures, Republican reaction, and the bill's chances. That should cover all the essential information succinctly.

Alright, putting it all together now, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the core elements of the article.

SUMMARY: The House of Representatives passed the For the People Act, a sweeping Democratic bill aimed at combating corruption, expanding voting rights, and imposing stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The legislation, which passed 234-193, includes provisions such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to those with felony convictions. It also introduces a six-to-one matching system for small donations to candidates who reject large contributions. Republicans criticized the bill as a "power grab" and a "government takeover," with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing not to bring it up for a vote. The bill also targets the Trump administration, requiring presidential candidates to release 10 years of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being used at businesses owned by the president or vice president. Despite opposition, Democrats remain united in support of the legislation, which they view as a key campaign issue ahead of the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
