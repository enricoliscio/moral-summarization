SUMMARY: The House of Representatives passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill on Friday, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1. The bill aims to remove barriers to voting, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The bill includes provisions such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to those who have served felony sentences. It also creates a matching system for small donations to congressional and presidential candidates and imposes new disclosure requirements on super PACs and dark money groups. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has branded it as a "Democrat Politician Protection Act." The bill also includes several provisions targeting ethical abuses in the White House, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Democrats successfully defeated a Republican attempt to include language allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote.
END OF SUMMARY.
