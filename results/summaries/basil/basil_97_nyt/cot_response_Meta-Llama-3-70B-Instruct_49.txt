SUMMARY:
The House passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, a sweeping measure aimed at dismantling barriers to the ballot box, ending big money in politics, and imposing stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The "For the People Act" or H.R. 1 is a "power grab for the American people," said Representative Zoe Lofgren. The bill includes proposals for designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. Democrats argue that the bill is necessary to address the "undue influence of special interests" in politics and to hold government leaders to the "highest standards." Republicans, however, have criticized the legislation as a "massive federal government takeover" that would "undermine the integrity of our elections." END OF SUMMARY.
