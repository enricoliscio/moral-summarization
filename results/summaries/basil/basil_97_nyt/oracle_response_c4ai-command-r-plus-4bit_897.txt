SUMMARY: The House passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules. The bill, called the For the People Act, includes proposals such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to felons. It also creates a matching system for small donations to congressional and presidential candidates and imposes new rules on dark money groups. The bill has been criticized by Republicans, who argue that it is a power grab by Democrats and undermines the integrity of elections. Some provisions have also been criticized for potentially infringing on First Amendment rights. The legislation includes several provisions targeting ethical abuses in the White House, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Democrats held steady against Republican attempts to divide their caucus and passed the bill, fulfilling a campaign pledge to clean up Washington.
