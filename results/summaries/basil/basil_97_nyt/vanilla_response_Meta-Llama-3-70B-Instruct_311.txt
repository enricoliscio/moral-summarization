SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a vote of 234-193. The bill aims to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes proposals such as designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also creates a matching system for small donations to congressional and presidential candidates and requires disclosure of donors to online political ads and dark-money groups. However, the bill has little chance of passing the Senate, with Republican leaders criticizing it as a "power grab" and a "federal government takeover." Democrats argue that the bill is necessary to address the influence of special interests in politics and to hold government leaders to higher ethical standards.
