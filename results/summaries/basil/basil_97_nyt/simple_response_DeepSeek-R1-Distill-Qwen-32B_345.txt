Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which is a big deal for Democrats. They're trying to fight corruption and improve voting rights. The summary should capture the key points without getting too bogged down in details.

First, I'll note that the bill passed 234-193, which shows a clear majority. It includes making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a donation matching system. These are all about increasing access and reducing the influence of big money.

Then, the Republicans are against it, calling it a power grab and a government takeover. They're branding it negatively, which is part of the political battle. The bill also targets the White House, requiring tax returns and limiting federal funds for officials' businesses. This is a direct criticism of the Trump administration's ethics.

Some parts of the bill, like the Disclose Act, are controversial because they might infringe on free speech. The ACLU opposes it, which adds another layer to the debate. The Democrats see this as a necessary step to clean up politics, but there are valid concerns from both sides.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main provisions, the political divide, and the moral implications. Highlighting how Democrats view it as a step towards accountability and Republicans as a power grab is essential. Also, mentioning the challenges it faces in the Senate and the opposition from both sides will show the complexity of the issue.

I should ensure the summary reflects the moral framing by emphasizing the fight against corruption, the push for transparency, and the debate over government influence versus individual rights. Balancing these elements will give a comprehensive yet concise overview of the article.

Democrats view the legislation as a step toward accountability and cleaning up Washington, while Republicans argue it infringes on states' rights and First Amendment protections.
