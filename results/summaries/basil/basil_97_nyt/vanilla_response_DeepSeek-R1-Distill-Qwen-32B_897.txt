Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the House passing the For the People Act. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying the House passed this legislation, which is a big deal for Democrats. It's about anti-corruption and voting rights. They mention it's a 700-page bill with several key provisions. Let me note those down: making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, a donation matching system for candidates who reject big money, and more transparency for political ads and dark-money groups.

I also see that Republicans are against it, calling it a power grab and a government takeover. They argue it's a threat to election integrity and First Amendment rights. The bill also targets the Trump administration, requiring presidents to release tax returns and preventing federal funds from being used at the president's businesses.

The article mentions the bill has little chance in the Senate, as Republicans are blocking it. Democrats are using it as a campaign tool for 2020. There's some internal debate among Democrats, but they held together against Republican attempts to divide them.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the passage of the bill, its main goals, key provisions, Republican opposition, and its political implications. I should keep it concise, highlighting the most important aspects without getting bogged down in details.

Let me structure it: first, the bill's passage and its purpose. Then, the main provisions. Next, Republican opposition and their arguments. Finally, the political context and the bill's chances in the Senate.

I should make sure each sentence is clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Let me draft that and check the word count to ensure it's under 200.

The U.S. House passed the For the People Act, a sweeping Democratic legislation aimed at combating corruption and expanding voting rights. The bill includes provisions to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register voters, restore voting rights for felons, and establish a donation matching system for candidates rejecting large contributions. It also mandates transparency for political ads and dark-money groups, requiring super PACs and nonprofits to disclose major donors. Republicans criticized the bill, branding it a federal takeover and a threat to First Amendment rights. The legislation targets the Trump administration, requiring presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds at the president's businesses. Despite these measures, the bill faces little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, serving as a campaign tool for Democrats ahead of the 2020 elections. END OF SUMMARY.
