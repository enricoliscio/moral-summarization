Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral stance.

The article is about the House passing the For the People Act, which is a major piece of legislation by Democrats aimed at anti-corruption and voting rights. It includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons, and a donation matching system. The bill also targets big money in politics and imposes stricter ethics on federal officials. Democrats are framing this as a power grab for the people, emphasizing transparency and reducing special interests' influence.

On the other hand, Republicans are opposing it, calling it a power grab for Democrats and arguing it undermines election integrity. They're branding it as socialist and a threat to First Amendment rights. There are criticisms from both sides, with some groups fearing overreach in the disclosure requirements.

The bill also includes provisions targeting the Trump administration, like requiring tax returns and prohibiting federal funds for businesses owned by officials. Democrats are highlighting the need for higher ethical standards after recent violations.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both sides. The Democrats are promoting transparency, reducing corruption, and expanding voting rights, positioning it as empowering the people. Republicans are against it, seeing it as an overreach and a threat to freedoms, using terms like socialist and undermining elections.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes both perspectives. I'll need to mention the key provisions and the moral framing from each side. Also, note that the bill has little chance in the Senate, which is part of the context.

Let me structure the summary: start with the House passing the bill, its main goals, the moral stance of Democrats, the opposition from Republicans, and the key provisions. Conclude with the political implications, like it being a campaign tool for 2020 and the Senate's unlikely passage.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to highlight the moral arguments, like Democrats fighting corruption and Republicans opposing government overreach.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be concise but cover all main points. Maybe start with the passage, then the Democrats' goals and framing, followed by Republican opposition and their framing, then the key provisions and the political context.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and captures the moral framing.

The legislation includes measures like making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, and curbing big money in politics through a donation matching system. Democrats frame it as empowering citizens and reducing special interests' influence, emphasizing transparency. Republicans oppose it, labeling it a socialist power grab that undermines election integrity and threatens freedoms. The bill also targets the Trump administration with provisions requiring tax returns and prohibiting federal funds for officials' businesses. While Democrats highlight ethical accountability, Republicans argue it overreaches and infringes on rights. The bill, seen as a 2020 campaign tool for Democrats, faces little chance in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
