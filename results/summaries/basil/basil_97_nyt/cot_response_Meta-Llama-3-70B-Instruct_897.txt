SUMMARY:
The House passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The sweeping bill, dubbed the "For the People Act," makes good on the campaign pledge to "clean up Washington" and serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. The legislation includes proposals to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. Democrats argue that the bill is a "power grab for the American people," while Republicans claim it's a "massive federal government takeover" that would "undermine the integrity of our elections." The bill also targets the White House, requiring presidents and vice presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or cabinet officials.
