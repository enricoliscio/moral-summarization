SUMMARY: The House of Representatives passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules. The bill, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, includes provisions to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to felons. It also addresses online political ad funding and dark money groups, with requirements for disclosure of donor names. While Democrats argue that the bill is necessary to address undue influence of special interests and protect the integrity of elections, Republicans have branded it as a power grab and a federal takeover that undermines election integrity. The bill also includes provisions targeting ethical violations by the Trump administration, such as requiring the release of tax returns and prohibiting spending at businesses owned by high-ranking officials. Democrats successfully held off a Republican attempt to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution on voting rights for illegal immigrants. With no chance of passing the Senate, the bill serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020.
END OF SUMMARY.
