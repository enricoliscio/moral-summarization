SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, aiming to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The bill, dubbed the "For the People Act," makes good on the Democrats' campaign pledge to clean up Washington and serves as a campaign platform ahead of 2020. It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. The legislation includes proposals to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. It also aims to reveal who funds online political ads and finances dark-money groups. Democrats argue that the bill is a "power grab for the American people," while Republicans have criticized it as a "massive federal government takeover" that would undermine election integrity.
