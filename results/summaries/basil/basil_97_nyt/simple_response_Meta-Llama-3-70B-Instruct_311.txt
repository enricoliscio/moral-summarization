SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, dubbed the "For the People Act" or H.R. 1, with a 234-193 vote. The bill aims to dismantle barriers to voting, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes provisions to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also targets dark money in politics and requires disclosure of donors who contribute over $10,000 to super PACs and nonprofit organizations. Democrats argue that the bill is a necessary step to clean up Washington and protect the integrity of elections, while Republicans have criticized it as a "power grab" and a "federal government takeover." The bill has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
