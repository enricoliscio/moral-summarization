SUMMARY: The House passed the Democrats' showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, which aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The sweeping legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, includes proposals to designate Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to those who have served felony sentences. It also creates a matching system for donations to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high-dollar contributions. While the bill has virtually no chance of passing the Senate, it serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. Some of the most debated provisions aim to reveal who funds online political ads and "dark-money" groups. The legislation also takes aim at the White House, addressing a laundry list of alleged ethical abuses by the Trump administration, including the failure to release tax returns and the spending of federal funds at businesses owned by the president and other cabinet officials. Democrats held steady in the face of Republican attempts to divide their caucus, determined to protect their signature legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
