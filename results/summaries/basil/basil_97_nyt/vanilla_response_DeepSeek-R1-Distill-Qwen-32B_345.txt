Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the House passing the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article mentions that the House passed the bill, called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a vote of 234-193. It's a major piece of legislation aimed at increasing voter access, reducing the influence of big money in politics, and tightening ethics rules for federal officials. Key provisions include making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights to felons, and a donation matching system funded by corporate fines. 

Democrats see this as fulfilling their campaign promises and a platform for the 2020 election, but it's unlikely to pass the Senate. Republicans are opposing it, with McConnell calling it the "Democrat Politician Protection Act" and McCarthy criticizing it as a government takeover. There's also debate over revealing donors of online ads and dark-money groups, with some arguing it infringes on First Amendment rights.

Additionally, the bill targets the Trump administration, requiring presidents to release tax returns, disclose inaugural committee expenditures, and prohibit federal funds from being used at businesses owned by the president or vice president. It also includes measures to track travel costs and prevent political appointees from using private jets for official business.

Republicans tried to divide Democrats by introducing a resolution about illegal immigrants voting, but Democrats stayed united. The summary should capture these points concisely, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure the summary to include the bill's passage, its main goals, key provisions, Republican opposition, and the significance of the legislation. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House passed the Democrats' For the People Act (H.R. 1), a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill, by a vote of 234-193. The legislation aims to expand voting access, reduce big money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for federal officials. Key provisions include making Election Day a federal holiday, automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights to felons, and a six-to-one donation matching system funded by corporate fines. Democrats view the bill as fulfilling their campaign promises and a platform for the 2020 election, though it faces little chance of passing the Senate. Republicans oppose it, with Sen. Mitch McConnell branding it the "Democrat Politician Protection Act." The bill also targets the Trump administration, requiring presidents to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds for businesses owned by the president or vice president. It includes measures to track travel costs and prevent private jet use for official business. Despite Republican efforts to divide Democrats, they remained united in support. END OF SUMMARY.
