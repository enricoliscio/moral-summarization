SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a vote of 234-193. The bill aims to increase voter access, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes provisions to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also targets dark money groups and online political ads, requiring disclosure of donors who contribute over $10,000. Additionally, it includes measures to address alleged ethical abuses by the Trump administration, such as requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns and prohibiting federal funds from being spent at businesses owned by the president or cabinet officials. The bill has little chance of passing the Senate, where Republicans have criticized it as a "power grab" and a "federal government takeover."

END OF SUMMARY.
