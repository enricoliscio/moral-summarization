SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has passed the Democrats' anti-corruption and voting rights legislation, known as the For the People Act or H.R. 1, with a 234-193 vote. The bill aims to expand voting rights, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. It includes proposals to make Election Day a federal holiday, automatically register citizens to vote, and restore voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. The bill also creates a matching system for small donations to congressional and presidential candidates. Republicans have criticized the bill, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledging not to take it up. The bill has been seen as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of the 2020 elections.
