Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to include the words "respect," "judged," "prayer," and "hurtful." Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, who posted a critical comment on Facebook about the Obama daughters. She criticized their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address, suggesting they lacked class and weren't good role models. She later apologized, mentioning prayer and how her words were hurtful. The White House and Rep. Fincher didn't comment.

I should start by introducing Lauten and her role. Then, mention her Facebook post and the specific criticisms she made. Highlight the use of "respect" and how she judged the girls. Then, include her apology, referencing prayer and the hurtful nature of her words. Finally, note the lack of response from the White House and Fincher.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the morally framed words. Let me structure it step by step to cover each point without getting too detailed.
