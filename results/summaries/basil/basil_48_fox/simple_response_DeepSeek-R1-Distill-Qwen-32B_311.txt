Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's needed.

The user provided a news article about Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for a Republican Congress member, who made offensive comments about the Obama daughters on Facebook. She later apologized. The user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also emphasized preserving the moral framing from the original text.

Okay, so first, I need to identify the key points of the article. Lauten criticized the first daughters' outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address, implying they lacked class and weren't good role models. She also criticized the President and First Lady. Her post was deleted, and she apologized, acknowledging her judgment was hurtful and vowing to learn from it. The White House and her employer didn't comment.

Now, the moral framing here is about respect, judgment, and accountability. Lauten's comments were disrespectful, especially targeting minors, and her apology shows taking responsibility. The summary needs to highlight these elements without losing the moral aspect.

I should structure the summary to include her criticism, the specifics of her comments, the apology, and the lack of response from others. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but comprehensive.

Let me draft it:

Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, apologized after criticizing the Obama daughters on Facebook. She commented on their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address, suggesting they lacked class and weren't good role models. Lauten also criticized the President and First Lady. After deleting the post, she apologized, admitting her judgment was hurtful and vowing to learn from the mistake. Neither the White House nor Fincher responded publicly.

Wait, that's too short. Maybe I can add more details about the event and her apology. Let me check the word count. Hmm, maybe around 100 words. I can expand a bit more without exceeding 200.

I think I've covered the main points. The summary should reflect her actions, the nature of her comments, the apology, and the lack of response. I should ensure it's clear and concise, preserving the moral elements of disrespect and accountability.
