Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words: respect, judged, prayer, hurtful. I have to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for a Republican Congress member, who made a controversial Facebook post about the Obama daughters. She criticized their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address. She later apologized, mentioning prayer and how her words were hurtful.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key elements: who she is, what she did, the content of the post, the apology, and the moral words. I'll make sure to use "respect," "judged," "prayer," and "hurtful" as per the instructions.

I'll start by stating her position and the incident. Then describe her criticism, the apology, and her reflection. I'll also mention that the White House and her employer didn't comment. I should keep the summary concise but cover all important points while maintaining the moral aspects highlighted by the author.

Let me structure it: introduce Lauten, her criticism, the specifics of the post, her apology, her use of prayer and acknowledging the hurtfulness. End with the lack of response from others. That should cover everything succinctly and include the required moral words.

SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn., apologized after a Facebook post criticized the Obama daughters, Malia and Sasha, during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten accused the 16 and 13-year-olds of lacking "class" and disrespecting their roles, while also criticizing the first couple for failing to set a good example. Her post was later deleted, and she acknowledged her judgment was hurtful, especially to teenagers. Lauten expressed regret, stating she had prayed and reflected on her words, pledging to learn and grow from the experience. Neither the White House nor Fincher responded publicly to the incident. END OF SUMMARY.
