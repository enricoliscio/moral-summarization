SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, ages 16 and 13, for their behavior and attire during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and dress more respectfully, also taking a shot at the President and First Lady. After facing backlash, Lauten deleted the post and issued an apology, acknowledging that she had judged the girls harshly and promising to learn and grow from the experience. The apology came after hours of reflection, prayer, and talking to her parents. Neither the White House nor Rep. Stephen Fincher, Lauten's employer, commented on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
