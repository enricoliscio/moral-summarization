Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The key words are respect, judged, prayer, and hurtful. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for a Republican congress member, who posted a critical Facebook comment about the Obama daughters. She criticized their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address. She also took shots at the President and First Lady. Later, she apologized, saying she judged them harshly and realized her words were hurtful. She mentioned prayer and learning from the experience.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words. I should mention her criticism, the specific comments about respect and class, the hurtful nature of her words, her judgment, and her apology involving prayer and learning.

I'll start by introducing Lauten and her role, then her Facebook post's content, the criticism of the girls, and her additional comments about Obama and his wife. Then, I'll note her apology, the use of prayer, and her pledge to learn. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key moral points are included.

SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, apologized after posting a critical Facebook comment about Malia and Sasha Obama during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. She criticized their outfits, suggesting they lacked class and respect, and accused them of not being good role models, implying their parents also failed in this regard. Lauten later acknowledged her judgment was hurtful, especially considering her own teenage experiences, and expressed regret after reflecting through prayer and conversation with her parents. She pledged to learn and grow from the incident. The White House and Fincher did not respond publicly. Lauten's initial post and subsequent apology highlight issues of respect, judgment, and the impact of public scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
