Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for a Republican congress member, apologizing for a Facebook post she made. She criticized the Obama daughters' outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address. She also took a shot at the Obamas, saying they weren't good role models. The post was deleted, and she later apologized, saying she judged them harshly and wants to learn from the mistake. Neither the White House nor her employer commented.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: who she is, what she did, the content of her post, the apology, and the lack of response from others. I'll structure it clearly, making sure to mention the Thanksgiving event, the turkey pardoning tradition, and her subsequent apology. I'll keep it concise, ensuring all important details are covered without unnecessary fluff.
