SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Republican member of Congress Rep. Stephen Fincher, criticized the Obama daughters' attire and behavior during the annual turkey pardoning ceremony in a now-deleted Facebook post. Lauten suggested that Malia and Sasha Obama lacked class and respectfulness, and also criticized their parents, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Lauten's comments sparked backlash, leading her to issue an apology, acknowledging the hurtfulness of her words and pledging to learn from the incident. The apology came after Lauten initially defended her comments, and neither the White House nor Fincher's office made any public statements on the issue. The incident highlights the scrutiny and expectations often placed on first daughters, and the potential consequences of public criticism. 

END OF SUMMARY.
