SUMMARY:

Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn), apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, ages 16 and 13, during President Barack Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and described their outfits as more suitable for "a spot at the bar." She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, suggesting they were poor role models. The post was deleted, and Lauten later apologized, saying she had "hurtful" words and pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The apology came after many hours of prayer and reflection. Neither the White House nor Fincher made a public comment on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
