SUMMARY:

A Republican communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters, Malia and Sasha, for their attire during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, implying they didn't respect their positions or the nation. However, after hours of prayer and reflection, Lauten apologized for her hurtful words, acknowledging that she had judged the girls harshly. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience, recognizing that her words were hurtful and that she wouldn't have wanted to be judged similarly as a teenager. The apology came after many hours of introspection, during which Lauten re-read her words online and consulted with her parents.

END OF SUMMARY.
