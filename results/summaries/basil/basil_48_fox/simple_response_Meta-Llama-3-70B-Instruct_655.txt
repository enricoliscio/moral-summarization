SUMMARY:

A Republican communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked outrage with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, ages 16 and 13, for their attire during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and dress more respectfully, even taking a jab at the President and First Lady, implying they were poor role models. However, after widespread backlash, Lauten apologized for her hurtful words, acknowledging that she had judged the girls harshly and would not have wanted to be judged similarly as a teenager. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The incident highlights the importance of treating others, especially children, with kindness and respect, and the need for self-reflection and accountability in our words and actions. END OF SUMMARY.
