SUMMARY: A communications director for a Republican member of Congress apologized for a Facebook post that criticized the first daughters, Malia and Sasha Obama, during President Barack Obama's Thanksgiving address. Elizabeth Lauten, in a now-deleted post, suggested that the girls should dress more respectfully and act with more class, even suggesting that they needed "a good role model." Lauten's comments were widely seen as hurtful and judgmental, and she later issued an apology, acknowledging that her words were inappropriate and that she had "quickly judged" the young women. Lauten noted that she had spent time in prayer and reflection, and realized the error of her ways. Neither the White House nor Rep. Stephen Fincher, for whom Lauten works, commented publicly on the issue. This incident highlights the importance of respecting the privacy and dignity of public figures, especially children, and the potential consequences of rash judgments.
END OF SUMMARY.
