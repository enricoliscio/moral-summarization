SUMMARY:

A Republican communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, the daughters of President Barack Obama, during the Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and dress more appropriately, implying that they were not respectful of their positions. She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, saying they were not good role models. After backlash, Lauten deleted the post and apologized, saying she had judged the girls harshly and pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The post was attributed to her and confirmed by The Washington Post. Neither the White House nor Rep. Stephen Fincher, Lauten's employer, commented on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
