Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about a Republican communications director who made some controversial Facebook posts about the Obama daughters. She criticized their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address. She also took shots at the Obamas themselves, saying they weren't good role models. 

Hmm, I should note the key points: who she is (Elizabeth Lauten, works for Rep. Stephen Fincher), what she said (criticized the girls' outfits and behavior), and her subsequent apology. Also, the context of the Thanksgiving turkey pardon, which is a tradition since 1947, but the pardon itself became permanent in 1989. 

Wait, the article mentions that the post was deleted and that she apologized, explaining she judged them harshly and that she's learned from the experience. The Washington Post confirmed her posts, but neither the White House nor Fincher responded. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include the main elements: who, what, when, where, why, how. So, start with the director apologizing, her criticism, the context of the event, her apology details, and the lack of response from others. 

I should also mention the tradition briefly to give context. Maybe something like, "during the Thanksgiving turkey pardon tradition." 

Putting it all together, I'll structure it to first introduce the apology, then the criticism, the event, the apology's content, and the aftermath. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, apologized after posting a critical Facebook comment about Malia and Sasha Obama during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten criticized the first daughters' outfits and behavior, suggesting they lacked class and respect, and also criticized their parents' role modeling. The post was made during the traditional turkey pardon ceremony, a practice dating back to 1947. Lauten later apologized, acknowledging her judgmental tone and the hurt caused by her words. She confirmed the posts, but neither the White House nor Fincher responded publicly. END OF SUMMARY.
