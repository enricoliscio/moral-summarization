Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used specific morally charged words: respect, judged, prayer, and hurtful. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for a Republican congress member, posted a critical comment about the Obama daughters on Facebook. She criticized their outfits and behavior, suggesting they didn't show class and didn't deserve respect. She also criticized the President and First Lady. After some time, she apologized, saying she judged them harshly and realized her words were hurtful. She mentioned prayer and talking to her parents as part of her reflection.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start by stating who Lauten is and her role. Then, mention her Facebook post, the content of the criticism, and the fact that it was deleted. Highlight the specific moral words: respect, judged, prayer, hurtful.

I should also include her apology, acknowledging her judgment and the hurt caused. Maybe mention the tradition of the turkey pardon to give context, but it's not the main point. I need to keep the summary concise but include all the key moral elements.

Let me structure it: introduce Lauten, her criticism, the content of the post, her apology, and the reflection process. Make sure to include the words respect, judged, prayer, hurtful.

I should also mention that neither the White House nor her employer commented, but that's secondary.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.
