SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Republican Congressman Stephen Fincher, has apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the first daughters should "show a little class" and dress more appropriately, and also took a swipe at their parents. The post sparked backlash and Lauten issued an apology, acknowledging that her words were hurtful and judgmental. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The incident occurred during the traditional turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House, which dates back to 1947. Neither the White House nor Fincher's office commented publicly on the matter.
END OF SUMMARY.
