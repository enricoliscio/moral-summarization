SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, the daughters of President Barack Obama, during the Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and dress more respectfully, also taking a shot at the President and First Lady. The post was deleted, but Lauten later apologized, saying she had judged the girls harshly and recognizing the hurtfulness of her words. The apology came after "many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online." Neither the White House nor Rep. Stephen Fincher, Lauten's employer, commented on the issue. The incident highlights the scrutiny faced by public figures, including the children of politicians.

END OF SUMMARY.
