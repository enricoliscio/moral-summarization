SUMMARY:
A Republican communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, aged 16 and 13, for their attire during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the sisters should "try showing a little class" and dress in a way that deserves respect. She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, implying they were poor role models. However, after hours of reflection and prayer, Lauten apologized for her hurtful words, acknowledging she would not have wanted to be judged similarly as a teenager. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience, recognizing the harm caused by her initial post. The White House and Rep. Fincher, Lauten's employer, declined to comment on the issue.
