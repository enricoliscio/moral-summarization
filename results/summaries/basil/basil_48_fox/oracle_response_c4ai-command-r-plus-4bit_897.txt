SUMMARY: A communications director for a Republican member of Congress apologized for a Facebook post critical of the first daughters during President Barack Obama's Thanksgiving address. Elizabeth Lauten, who works for Rep. Stephen Fincher, wrote that Malia and Sasha Obama should "show a little class" and dress in a way that "deserves respect". Lauten also took a shot at President Obama and the first lady, suggesting they don't "respect their positions". In a later apology, Lauten acknowledged that her words were hurtful and that she had "quickly judged" the young women. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience, recognizing the importance of respecting others and avoiding harsh judgments. Neither the White House nor Fincher commented publicly on the issue. Lauten's original post and subsequent apology highlight the potential consequences of public criticism, especially when directed at minors, and serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a respectful dialogue, even in political discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
