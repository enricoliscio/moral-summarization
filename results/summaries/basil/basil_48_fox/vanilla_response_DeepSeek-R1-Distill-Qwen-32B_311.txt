Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, who posted a critical comment on Facebook about the Obama daughters. She criticized their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address, suggesting they should dress more respectfully. She also criticized the Obamas as role models. The post was later deleted, and she apologized, saying she judged them harshly and that her words were hurtful. The Washington Post confirmed her posts, but neither the White House nor Fincher commented.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: who she is, what she did, the content of her post, the context of the Thanksgiving event, her apology, and the lack of response from others.

Let me structure this. Start with her position, her critical post, the specifics of her criticism, the event context, her apology, and the aftermath. Keep it concise, making sure not to exceed the word limit.

I should avoid any unnecessary details, like the history of the turkey pardon, unless it's essential. It's probably enough to mention it briefly as context for the event.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner without losing the main points.
