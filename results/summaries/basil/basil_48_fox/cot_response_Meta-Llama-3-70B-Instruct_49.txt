SUMMARY:
A Republican member of Congress's communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing the first daughters, Malia and Sasha Obama, for their behavior during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" instead of making faces during the televised event. She also took a shot at the President and the First Lady, implying they were not "good role models." After backlash, Lauten apologized, acknowledging her words were "hurtful" and promising to "learn and grow" from the experience. She realized she had judged the girls harshly, something she wouldn't have wanted as a teenager. Lauten's apology came after "many hours of prayer" and reflection. Neither the White House nor Rep. Stephen Fincher commented on the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
