Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. 

The article talks about Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, who posted a critical comment about the Obama daughters on Facebook. She criticized their outfits and behavior during the Thanksgiving address. She also took shots at the President and First Lady, saying they weren't good role models. 

The author used words like "respect," "judged," "prayer," and "hurtful." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I should start by identifying the main points: who did what, what they said, the reaction, and the apology. The key moral elements are the lack of respect, the judgment, the use of prayer in the apology, and the hurtful words.

So, the summary should mention that Lauten criticized the first daughters, using the word "respect." She judged them harshly, which is another moral term. She later apologized, mentioning prayer, and acknowledged her words were hurtful. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: mention her position, her critical post, the具体内容 of her criticism, the apology including prayer and hurtful words, and the lack of response from others.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." 

Let me draft it:

Elizabeth Lauten, a communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, apologized after criticizing the Obama daughters on Facebook. She judged their outfits and behavior, questioning their respect for their positions. Lauten also criticized the President and First Lady for not being good role models. After prayer and reflection, she acknowledged her words were hurtful and apologized, pledging to learn from the experience. Neither the White House nor Fincher responded publicly.

Wait, that's under 200 words and includes all the moral terms. I think that works.
