SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for a Republican member of Congress, issued an apology for a Facebook post that was critical of the first daughters, Malia and Sasha Obama, during President Barack Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten's original post suggested that the girls should "show a little class" and dress in a way that "deserves respect". She also took a swipe at their parents, suggesting they lacked respect for their positions and were poor role models. Lauten's comments sparked outrage, leading her to apologize and admit that she had "quickly judged" the girls and that her words were hurtful. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The incident highlights the potential consequences of publicly judging and disrespecting others, especially those in positions of power and influence. END OF SUMMARY.
