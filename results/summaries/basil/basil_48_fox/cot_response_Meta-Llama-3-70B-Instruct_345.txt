SUMMARY:
A Republican congressional staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters, Malia and Sasha, for their attire during the President's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, implying they were not "good role models." The post was met with widespread criticism, prompting Lauten to issue an apology, acknowledging her words were "hurtful" and vowing to "learn and grow" from the experience. In her apology, Lauten expressed remorse for judging the girls harshly, admitting she would not have wanted to be judged similarly as a teenager. The incident highlights the importance of respecting the dignity of public figures, particularly children. END OF SUMMARY.
