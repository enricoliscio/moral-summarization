SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters, Malia and Sasha, for their behavior during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" during public events. She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, implying they were poor role models. However, after reflecting on her words and engaging in prayer, Lauten apologized for her hurtful comments, acknowledging that she had judged the girls in a way she wouldn't have wanted to be judged as a teenager. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The apology came after many hours of introspection and conversation with her parents. The incident highlights the importance of treating others with respect and kindness, especially in public forums.
