SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, ages 16 and 13, for their behavior and attire during President Barack Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and dress more respectfully, also taking a shot at the President and First Lady. The post was later deleted, and Lauten apologized, saying she had judged the girls harshly and realized her words were hurtful. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The apology came after many hours of reflection, prayer, and discussion with her parents. Neither the White House nor Lauten's employer, Rep. Stephen Fincher, commented publicly on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
