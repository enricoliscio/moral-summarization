Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, who posted a critical comment on Facebook about the Obama daughters. She criticized their outfits and demeanor during the Thanksgiving address. She also took shots at the President and First Lady, implying they weren't good role models. The post was later deleted, and she apologized, acknowledging her judgment was hurtful and vowing to learn from the experience. The White House and Rep. Fincher didn't comment.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with the specified tokens. I need to make sure to include the moral aspects, like the criticism of the girls' behavior and the apology acknowledging the hurt caused. Also, highlighting the contrast between the respectful tradition and the personal attack is important for the moral framing.

I should structure the summary to first mention Lauten's criticism, then her apology, and note the lack of response from the involved parties. Keeping it concise but covering all key points without losing the moral angle.

Let me draft that, making sure it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the tokens.
