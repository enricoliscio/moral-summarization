SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Republican Congressman Stephen Fincher, has had to apologize for a Facebook post critical of Malia and Sasha Obama, the teenage daughters of President Barack Obama. Lauten's post, which has since been deleted, took aim at the girls' clothing choices and facial expressions during their father's Thanksgiving address, suggesting they lacked class and respect. She also criticized the Obamas' parenting skills, implying that they were not good role models for their daughters. Lauten's comments sparked outrage, and she was forced to issue an apology, acknowledging the hurtful nature of her words and pledging to learn from her mistake. The incident highlights the potential consequences of publicly criticizing minors, even when they are the children of public figures, and serves as a reminder that individuals in positions of authority should uphold a higher moral standard, demonstrating respect and refraining from personal attacks, especially when children are involved. 

END OF SUMMARY.
