SUMMARY:
A Republican congressional staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama, aged 16 and 13, for their behavior during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" during public events. She also took a shot at the President and First Lady, implying they were not "good role models." After backlash, Lauten apologized, acknowledging her words were "hurtful" and promising to "learn and grow" from the experience. Her apology came after "many hours of prayer" and "talking to my parents." The White House and Rep. Fincher, Lauten's employer, declined to comment on the issue. Lauten's apology highlights the importance of respecting others, especially young people, and being mindful of the impact of our words on others. END OF SUMMARY.
