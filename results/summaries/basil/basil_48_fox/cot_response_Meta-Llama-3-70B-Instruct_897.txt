SUMMARY:
A Republican communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters, Malia and Sasha, for their behavior during President Obama's Thanksgiving address. Lauten wrote that the girls should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" instead of making faces during a televised event. She also took a jab at the President and First Lady, implying they were poor role models. After facing backlash, Lauten apologized for her "hurtful" words, acknowledging that she had judged the girls harshly and promising to "learn and grow" from the experience. Her apology came after hours of prayer and reflection, during which she realized the harm caused by her initial post. The White House and Rep. Fincher, Lauten's employer, declined to comment on the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
