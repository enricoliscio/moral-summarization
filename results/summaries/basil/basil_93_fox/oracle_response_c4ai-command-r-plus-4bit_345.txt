SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with disdain by Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of holding federal workers hostage and causing chaos. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats called the proposal a "non-starter," claiming it lacked sympathy for federal workers and did not offer a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients. They demanded Trump stop taking the government hostage and end the shutdown, allowing for negotiations to progress. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader McConnell commended the president for taking bipartisan steps towards addressing immigration issues and called the proposal a fair compromise. Republican Whip Steve Scalise urged Democrats to put aside their personal dislike of the president and engage in meaningful negotiations. The contrasting reactions highlight the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats criticizing the proposal as ineffective and one-sided, while Republicans view it as a reasonable step towards resolving the shutdown and securing the border. The shutdown continues to hurt federal workers and the economy, and the impasse remains unresolved.
END OF SUMMARY.
