SUMMARY: President Trump's compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with sharp reactions from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Many Democrats accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers hostage by offering temporary relief for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for border wall funding. They criticized the proposal as a non-starter, one-sided, ineffective, and unacceptable. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the government to be reopened before any negotiations on border security and immigration reform. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and compromise, urging Democrats to put aside their personal dislike of the president and come to the negotiating table. They described Trump's proposal as reasonable, fair, and serious. The reactions highlighted the deep partisan divide and the ongoing stalemate over the government shutdown and immigration debate.
