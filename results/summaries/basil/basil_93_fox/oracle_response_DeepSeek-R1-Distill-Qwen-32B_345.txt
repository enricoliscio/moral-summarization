Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. They also listed a set of morally charged words that the author used, which I need to include in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump offered a compromise to end the government shutdown by extending DACA protections for three years in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats were critical, calling it a bad deal and accusing Trump of holding the government and workers hostage. They emphasized that the shutdown was causing harm and chaos, and they wanted a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients. They also criticized the wall as ineffective and unnecessary.

On the Republican side, there was support for Trump's willingness to negotiate, viewing it as a fair compromise. They wanted Democrats to stop obstructing and come to the table. The article also mentioned the economic impacts and the humanitarian crisis at the border.

Now, I need to create a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should highlight the key reactions from both parties, the accusations of hostage-taking, the shutdown's impact, and the moral criticism from Democrats. I'll also mention the Republican support for compromise and their call for Democrats to negotiate.

I'll structure the summary by first stating Trump's proposal, then the Democratic criticism, followed by Republican support, and conclude with the ongoing shutdown's effects. I'll make sure to use words like shutdown, hostage, sympathy, chaos, ineffective, hurting, etc., to maintain the moral framing.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence captures the essence and includes the necessary moral terms without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown by offering a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats criticized the plan as one-sided and ineffective, accusing Trump of holding federal workers and the government "hostage." They argued that Dreamers and TPS recipients should not be bargaining chips and demanded a permanent solution. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the shutdown "untenable" and urged reopening the government to negotiate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump for lacking sympathy for federal workers. Republicans praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader McConnell calling the proposal a "fair compromise." Democrats, however, deemed it a "bad deal," accusing Trump of forcing a shutdown to fund an ineffective wall. The shutdown continues to harm millions, with federal workers without paychecks and the economy suffering. END OF SUMMARY.
