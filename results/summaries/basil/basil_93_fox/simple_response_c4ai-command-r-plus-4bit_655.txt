SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package, offered in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall, was met with strong opposition by Democratic lawmakers who accused him of holding the government and federal workers "hostage." Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats criticized the proposal as a "non-starter," arguing that it does not provide a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients. They demanded an end to the shutdown and a subsequent negotiation on border security. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised the president's willingness to negotiate and compromise, urging Democrats to put aside their differences and come to the negotiating table. Senator McConnell and others described the proposal as a "fair compromise," reflecting bipartisan priorities. The contrasting reactions highlight the deep divide between the two parties on immigration and border security issues, with Democrats refusing to budge on their anti-wall stance and Republicans standing firm on the need for a border wall. END OF SUMMARY.
