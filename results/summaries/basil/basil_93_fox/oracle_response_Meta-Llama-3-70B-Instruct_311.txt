SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package has sparked sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump's proposal, which includes a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, has been met with disdain from top Democratic lawmakers. They accuse Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and creating "chaos" with his "one-sided" and "ineffective" remedies. Democrats argue that Trump's proposal does not provide a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients, and that he is "forcing" a "pointless shutdown" to pay for an "expensive" and "ineffective" wall. In contrast, Republican lawmakers have praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" offer. The stalemate continues, with Democrats urging Trump to "reopen" the government and Republicans calling on Democrats to put aside their "personal dislike" of the president and negotiate.
