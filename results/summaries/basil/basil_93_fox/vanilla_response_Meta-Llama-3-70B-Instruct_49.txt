SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has received mixed reactions from lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Top Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, criticized the proposal, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage." They argued that the proposal does not include a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients and that Trump should reopen the government before negotiating. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commending the president for taking "bipartisan steps" towards addressing immigration issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
