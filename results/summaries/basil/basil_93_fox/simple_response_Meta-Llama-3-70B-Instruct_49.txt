SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a border barrier. Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided and ineffective." They argued that Trump's offer did not include a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients and that he was using them as bargaining chips. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate and compromise.

The moral framing of this issue is clear: Trump's actions are seen as holding innocent people hostage and using them as pawns in a political game, while Democrats are fighting for a more humane and compassionate approach to immigration reform.
