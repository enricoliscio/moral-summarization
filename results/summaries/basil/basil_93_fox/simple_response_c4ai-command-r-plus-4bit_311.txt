SUMMARY: President Trump's proposal to end the partial government shutdown by offering Democrats a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for funding for a border wall was met with strong opposition from Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of holding federal workers "hostage." They criticized his offer as "one-sided" and "ineffective," demanding that he first end the shutdown and then negotiate on border security. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to work with him to reach a compromise. They viewed his proposal as a "reasonable" and "good faith" effort to resolve the impasse and urged their Democratic colleagues to match his negotiating spirit. This stark contrast in reactions highlights the deep partisan divide and the challenge of finding a solution to end the prolonged government shutdown. END OF SUMMARY.
