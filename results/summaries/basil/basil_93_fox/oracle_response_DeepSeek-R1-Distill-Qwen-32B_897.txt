Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about President Trump's immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. He offered a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. The Democrats are really against this, calling it hostage-taking and ineffective. They argue that the shutdown is hurting federal workers and that DACA recipients shouldn't be bargaining chips. Republicans, on the other hand, support the compromise, saying it's a fair step towards immigration reform.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like "shutdown," "hostage," "hurting," "untenable," "ineffective," "crisis," etc., are important. I should structure the summary to reflect the opposing viewpoints, highlighting the Democrats' criticism and the Republicans' support.

I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, then move on to the Democratic reactions, their use of terms like hostage and ineffective, and their emphasis on the shutdown's impact. Then, I'll contrast that with the Republican support, using terms like compromise and reopening. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft this, making sure to include the moral framing words and keep the summary balanced between both parties' perspectives.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for a border wall to end the government shutdown, but Democrats criticized it as "hostage-taking" and "ineffective," accusing him of forcing federal workers into "chaos." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the offer "untenable" and urged reopening the government for bipartisan "discussion." Democrats argued DACA recipients shouldn't be "bargaining chips" and criticized the shutdown for "hurting" workers. Republicans praised the compromise as a "fair step" toward immigration reform, with Senate Majority Leader McConnell calling it a "bipartisan approach." Sen. Romney and others expressed hope for a "constructive debate," while House Leader McCarthy urged Democrats to accept the "reasonable" offer. The shutdown's "impacts" worsen daily, with federal workers "without" paychecks and the economy "damaged." END OF SUMMARY.
