SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and rejected the proposal as "one-sided and ineffective." They argued that Trump's offer did not provide a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients and that he was using them as bargaining chips. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to match his efforts. The impasse continues, with Democrats demanding that the government be reopened before negotiations can proceed.

END OF SUMMARY.
