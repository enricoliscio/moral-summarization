SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with mixed reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall with Mexico. Democratic leaders such as Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Steny Hoyer criticized the proposal, accusing Trump of holding federal workers "hostage." They called for the government to be reopened before negotiations could proceed. Other Democrats like Kirsten Gillibrand and Bob Menendez also rejected the proposal, calling it a "bad deal" and accusing Trump of creating a humanitarian crisis at the border. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commended the president for taking bipartisan steps, while Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's negotiation efforts. Sen. Susan Collins expressed hope for a constructive debate, and Sen. Mitt Romney called Trump's proposal "reasonable." Sen. Marco Rubio also supported the deal, urging Democrats to work with the president to end the shutdown. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy described the offer as "reasonable."
END OF SUMMARY.
