Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible and should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump's immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. The Democrats are criticizing his proposal, calling it a bad deal and hostage-taking, while Republicans are supportive, seeing it as a reasonable compromise.

Next, I need to identify the key morally framed words used by the author. These include shutdown, hostage, sympathy, chaos, one-sided, ineffective, hurting, untenable, open, discussion, solutions, crisis, obstruction, etc. I should ensure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Trump's offer, Democratic reactions, Republican reactions, and the ongoing shutdown's impact. I'll make sure each point incorporates the moral language.

I should also keep the summary concise, so I'll need to be selective about which details to include without losing the essence. It's important to highlight the opposing viewpoints clearly, using the specified terms to convey the criticism and support accurately.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's proposal, moving to Democratic criticisms, then Republican support, and ending with the ongoing impact of the shutdown. I'll ensure that each sentence uses the morally framed words where appropriate to reflect the original article's tone.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the proposal as one-sided and ineffective, accusing Trump of holding federal workers hostage and failing to show sympathy for those affected by the shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the offer "hostage-taking," while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deemed it a "non-starter." Democrats argued that Dreamers and TPS recipients should not be bargaining chips and demanded the government reopen before negotiations. Republican leaders praised Trump's willingness to compromise, with Senate Majority Leader McConnell calling the proposal a fair bipartisan approach. However, Democrats accused Trump of forcing a pointless shutdown and creating a humanitarian crisis. The shutdown, now in its third week, has left 800,000 federal workers without paychecks, harming families and the economy. Democrats urged Trump to reopen the government to facilitate constructive discussions, while Republicans pressed for Democrats to end obstruction and accept the deal. The stalemate continues, with both sides emphasizing the need for compromise to secure the border and serve the American people. END OF SUMMARY.
