Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. He offered a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats are reacting negatively, calling it hostage-taking and ineffective. They argue that DACA recipients shouldn't be bargaining chips. Republicans, on the other hand, praise the proposal as a good step towards compromise. The shutdown is affecting federal workers and the economy.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both sides. Democrats see it as Trump holding the government hostage, while Republicans view it as a necessary compromise. I should mention key figures like Pelosi, Schumer, and McConnell, highlighting their perspectives. Also, note the impact on workers and the economy.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, then outline the Democratic criticism, followed by Republican support. Finally, I'll mention the shutdown's impact. Let me make sure to include the moral framing each side presents without bias.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the plan, calling it "hostage-taking" and ineffective, arguing DACA recipients shouldn't be bargaining chips. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of failing to address the humanitarian crisis and urged reopening the government for bipartisan talks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the proposal as a "non-starter." Meanwhile, Republicans praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader McConnell calling it a "fair compromise." Republican Sen. Mitt Romney described it as a "reasonable, good faith proposal." The shutdown, affecting 800,000 federal workers, was criticized for its economic impact. Democrats demanded reopening before further negotiations, while Republicans urged Democrats to accept the deal. END OF SUMMARY.
