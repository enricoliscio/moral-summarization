SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with strong reactions from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. While Republican lawmakers praised the president's willingness to negotiate, Democratic lawmakers criticized the proposal as "hostage-taking" and a "bad deal." They accused Trump of holding federal workers and the government hostage by offering temporary relief for Dreamers and TPS recipients in exchange for a permanent border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the proposal "a non-starter" and demanded the government be reopened before any negotiations. Other Democratic lawmakers, such as Senator Bob Menendez and Representative Steny Hoyer, echoed similar sentiments. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers commended Trump for taking bipartisan steps towards addressing immigration issues. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Susan Collins emphasized the need for compromise in divided government. Senator Mitt Romney and Senator Marco Rubio also supported the proposal, calling it a "reasonable offer." House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy described the offer as "serious and reasonable." The reactions highlight the stark divide between the two parties, with Democrats criticizing the moral implications of the proposal and Republicans praising the president's negotiation efforts.
