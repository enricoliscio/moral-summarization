SUMMARY:
President Trump's immigration compromise package has drawn sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier, claiming that the immigration system should be a "source of pride, not shame." However, top Democratic lawmakers accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided," "ineffective," and "bad." They argued that Trump's offer was not a compromise but rather "hostage taking" and that he should "stop holding government hostage" and end the shutdown. In contrast, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal "reasonable" and "good faith." The stalemate continues, with Democrats demanding a "legitimate negotiation" and Republicans urging Democrats to put aside their "personal dislike" of the president and come to the negotiating table.
