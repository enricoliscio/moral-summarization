SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package, offered in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall, was met with mixed reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Democrats criticized the proposal as "hostage-taking," accusing Trump of using federal workers and immigrants as bargaining chips. They called for the government to be reopened before negotiations, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting the offer as a "non-starter." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats echoed this sentiment, urging Trump to "stop holding the government hostage." On the other hand, Republicans praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commended the president for taking a bipartisan approach, while Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to put aside their personal dislike of Trump and negotiate. Sen. Susan Collins expressed hope for a constructive debate, and Sen. Mitt Romney supported the proposal as a "reasonable, good faith" effort. Sen. Marco Rubio and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also viewed the offer positively.
END OF SUMMARY.
