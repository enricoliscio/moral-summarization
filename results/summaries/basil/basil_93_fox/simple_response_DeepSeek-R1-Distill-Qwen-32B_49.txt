Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The user has specified that I should focus on the moral aspects, so I need to highlight the key arguments and the ethical stances of both Democrats and Republicans.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump proposed an immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. He offered a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats are criticizing this as holding federal workers hostage, while Republicans are praising the compromise.

I should note the moral arguments from each side. Democrats argue that Trump is using federal workers as bargaining chips and that the proposal doesn't offer permanent solutions for Dreamers and TPS recipients. They see it as unethical to shut down the government and withhold protections. Republicans, on the other hand, view the compromise as a necessary step towards a solution and criticize Democrats for obstruction.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of both parties' moral perspectives. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's proposal, then the Democratic criticism, followed by Republican support, and conclude with the ongoing impasse.

I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward, ensuring that the moral framing is evident in each party's response. Also, I need to include key points like the temporary nature of Trump's offer and the Democrats' demand for a permanent solution.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each paragraph covers a different aspect: introduction, Democratic reaction, Republican reaction, and the conclusion about the shutdown's impact. I'll make sure to include quotes or paraphrases that highlight the moral stances, like Pelosi calling it hostage-taking or McConnell praising compromise.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension for 700,000 recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the deal as "hostage-taking," arguing it fails to provide permanent solutions for Dreamers and TPS recipients, while Republicans praised it as a fair compromise. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of exploiting federal workers, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the proposal "a non-starter." Democrats emphasized the need for a permanent solution, not temporary fixes, and demanded the government reopen before negotiations. Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader McConnell, commended Trump's willingness to negotiate, framing the proposal as a bipartisan step toward resolving immigration issues. The shutdown continued, with Democrats insisting on a permanent solution and Republicans advocating for the wall funding. END OF SUMMARY.
