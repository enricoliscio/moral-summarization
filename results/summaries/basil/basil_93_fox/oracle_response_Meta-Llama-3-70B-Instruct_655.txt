SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. However, top Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided" and "ineffective." They argued that Trump's offer was a "bad deal" that would only temporarily give back what he took away, and that he was "forcing" a "pointless shutdown" to pay for an "expensive, ineffective wall." In contrast, Republican lawmakers praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable, good faith" offer. END OF SUMMARY.
