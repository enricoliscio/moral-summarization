SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package has sparked sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump's proposal, which includes a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, has been met with disdain from top Democratic lawmakers. They accuse Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and forcing a "pointless shutdown" to pay for the wall. Democrats argue that Trump's proposal is "one-sided" and "ineffective," and that he is using DACA and TPS recipients as "bargaining chips." They demand that Trump "reopen" the government and then negotiate a bipartisan solution. In contrast, Republican lawmakers praise Trump for his willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" offer. They urge Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate and end the "chaos" and "crisis" at the border. END OF SUMMARY.
