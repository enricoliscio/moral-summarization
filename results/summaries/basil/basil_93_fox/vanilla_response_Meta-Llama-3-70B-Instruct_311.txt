SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has received mixed reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, rejected the proposal, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage." They demanded that the government be reopened before negotiations can proceed. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commending the president for taking "bipartisan steps" towards addressing immigration issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
