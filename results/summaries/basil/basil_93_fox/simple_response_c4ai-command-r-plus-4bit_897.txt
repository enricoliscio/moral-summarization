SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with strong criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accuse him of holding federal workers "hostage." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats, such as Chuck Schumer and Steny Hoyer, rejected Trump's proposal as a "non-starter," arguing that it does not offer a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients. They insist that the government must be reopened before any negotiations can take place. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to put aside their differences and work towards a compromise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, such as Susan Collins and Marco Rubio, characterized Trump's proposal as a fair and reasonable compromise that addresses border security and immigration concerns. This moral framing of "hostage-taking" versus "willingness to negotiate" highlights the starkly different perspectives of Democratic and Republican lawmakers in response to Trump's immigration compromise package.
