SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise package to end the partial government shutdown, offering Democrats a three-year extension of protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall with Mexico. The proposal was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer rejected the proposal, calling it "a non-starter" and "one-sided." Other Democratic lawmakers, including Steny Hoyer, Kristen Gillibrand, and Bob Menendez, echoed similar sentiments. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised the president's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Whip Steve Scalise supported Trump's proposal, calling on Democrats to negotiate. Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney also expressed support for the compromise, with Romney calling it a "reasonable, good faith proposal." Senator Marco Rubio and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also viewed the deal positively.
END OF SUMMARY.
