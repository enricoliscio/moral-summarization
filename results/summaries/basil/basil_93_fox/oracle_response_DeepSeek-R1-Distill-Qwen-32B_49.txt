Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. The article discusses President Trump's immigration compromise, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, and the moral implications of the shutdown.

First, I'll identify the key points: Trump offers a DACA extension and funding for a border wall, leading to a shutdown. Democrats criticize him for holding the government and workers hostage, while Republicans support the compromise as a step towards reform.

Next, I need to include as many morally framed words as possible. Words like "shutdown," "hostage," "hurting," "untenable," "crisis," "obstruction," and "compromise" are crucial. I should ensure the summary reflects the moral stances from both parties, showing Democrats' frustration and Republicans' support.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's proposal, then the Democratic criticisms, followed by Republican support, and conclude with the ongoing impact of the shutdown. I need to keep it concise, around 200 words, so each section should be brief but comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral language and maintain the essence of both parties' reactions. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the deal as "one-sided" and "ineffective," accusing Trump of "holding the government and federal workers hostage." They argued the proposal did not provide permanent solutions for Dreamers and TPS recipients and called the shutdown "untenable" and "chaotic." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned Trump for prioritizing the wall over workers' well-being, urging him to "open the government" for bipartisan discussions. Republican leaders, like McConnell, praised the compromise as a "fair" step toward immigration reform, though some, like Romney, questioned Pelosi's stance on border security. The shutdown, they argued, was "hurting" millions, with federal workers "without paychecks" and the economy "damaged." Democrats demanded an end to the shutdown before negotiations, while Republicans urged Democrats to "stop obstruction" and accept the deal. The impasse continued, with the shutdown's "impacts" worsening, as both sides struggled to find a "sensible solution." END OF SUMMARY.
