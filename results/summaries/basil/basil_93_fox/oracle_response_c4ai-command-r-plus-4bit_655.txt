SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with sharp criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for funding for a border wall. Many Democrats accused Trump of taking federal workers and immigrants "hostage" and "shutting down" the government, causing "chaos" and "hurting" Americans. They called his proposal "one-sided" and "ineffective," and demanded that he "stop holding government hostage" and "end the shutdown." Some Democrats also criticized Trump for eliminating TPS protections and creating a "crisis" at the border. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and called his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" effort to reopen the government and address immigration issues. They urged Democrats to put aside their "obstruction" and work with the President to find a solution. The shutdown continues as negotiations remain at an "impasse."
END OF SUMMARY.
