SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a compromise to end the partial government shutdown, offering Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. However, top Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have rejected the proposal, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage." They argue that the proposal does not provide a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients and that Trump is trying to negotiate while holding the government shutdown. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, have praised the president for his willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commending the president for taking "bipartisan steps" towards addressing immigration issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
