Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about President Trump's immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral perspectives presented.

First, Trump offered a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. He presented this as a way to fix the immigration system, which he says is a source of shame. Democrats are reacting negatively, calling it hostage-taking because he's using the shutdown to force the wall funding. Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer, and others are critical, saying the proposal isn't a real compromise and that the shutdown is unnecessary. They argue that the shutdown is harming federal workers and the economy, and that the wall is ineffective. Republicans, on the other hand, support Trump's approach, seeing it as a good-faith effort and a fair compromise.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both sides. Democrats see Trump as using federal workers as hostages, while Republicans view the proposal as a reasonable compromise. The shutdown is presented as a tool of coercion by Trump, which is morally wrong according to Democrats, while Republicans see it as a necessary step towards a solution.

I should structure the summary to highlight these opposing moral viewpoints. Start with Trump's offer, then the Democratic criticism, followed by Republican support. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key moral points each side is making.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to include the main points and the moral framing without getting into too much detail.

Democrats emphasized the shutdown's harm to federal workers and the economy, deeming the wall ineffective, while Republicans viewed the proposal as a fair compromise and a step toward border security. END OF SUMMARY.
