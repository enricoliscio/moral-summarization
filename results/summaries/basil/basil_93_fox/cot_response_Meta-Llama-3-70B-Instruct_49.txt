SUMMARY:
President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. However, top Democratic lawmakers accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and called his proposal "one-sided" and "ineffective." They argued that Trump's proposal was a "bad deal" and that he was trying to use DACA recipients as "bargaining chips." Democratic lawmakers urged Trump to "stop holding government hostage" and end the shutdown, calling it a "pointless" and "senseless" move that was "hurting" millions of Americans. In contrast, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" offer. END OF SUMMARY.
