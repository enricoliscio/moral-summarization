END OF STEP 1

SUMMARY: President Trump presented an immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown, but it was met with intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers who accused him of holding the government and federal workers hostage. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described the proposal as a "non-starter," while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer labeled it as "one-sided and ineffective." They, along with other Democrats, asserted that Trump was taking Dreamers and TPS recipients hostage by offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent border wall. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised the President's willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commending him for taking bipartisan steps towards addressing immigration issues. Republican Whip Steve Scalise urged Democrats to match Trump's negotiating efforts and end their intense obstruction. Florida Senator Marco Rubio viewed the proposal positively, calling it a "reasonable offer." The intense impasse continues, with Democrats and Republicans holding firm to their positions.
