SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of holding federal workers hostage and causing chaos. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the proposal as a "non-starter," while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it "one-sided and ineffective." Democrats maintained that Trump was taking Dreamers and TPS recipients as hostages by offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent border wall. They demanded an end to the shutdown, arguing that negotiations should proceed with the government open. Republican lawmakers, however, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and viewed his proposal as a reasonable compromise. Senate Majority Leader McConnell and others encouraged Democrats to put aside their political games and work towards a deal to reopen the government. Senator Marco Rubio also urged Democrats to work with the President, calling his offer a "very reasonable" one. The divide in reactions highlights the moral framing of the shutdown debate, with Democrats emphasizing the harm caused to federal workers and the nation, while Republicans focus on the need for compromise and border security.
END OF SUMMARY.
