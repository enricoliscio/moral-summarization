Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from lawmakers. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by saying Trump proposed a deal to end the government shutdown. He offered a three-year extension for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. He made this offer in a televised address, emphasizing that immigration should be a source of pride, not shame.

Now, the Democrats are reacting negatively. Pelosi called it a non-starter because it doesn't provide permanent solutions. Schumer criticized it as one-sided and ineffective, pointing out that Trump took away DACA protections in the first place. Hoyer and Gillibrand also criticized the offer, calling it hostage-taking and a bad deal. Menendez accused Trump of forcing a shutdown for the wall. Coons said it's a first step but wants the government reopened first.

On the Republican side, McConnell praised the proposal as a fair compromise, saying it includes both parties' priorities. Scalise urged Democrats to negotiate, and Collins expressed hope for a constructive debate. Romney and Rubio supported the offer, with Romney questioning Pelosi's stance on border security. McCarthy also called the offer reasonable and turned the focus to Pelosi and Schumer.

So, the summary should include Trump's proposal, the Democratic criticism, and Republican support. It should also mention the key points each side made, like Democrats arguing it's a temporary fix and Republicans seeing it as a compromise.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main reactions without too much detail. Make sure to include that Democrats see it as hostage-taking and Republicans see it as a step towards compromise. Also, note that the government shutdown is ongoing and the proposal's fate is uncertain.

Alright, I think I have a good grasp of the main points. Time to put it together concisely.
