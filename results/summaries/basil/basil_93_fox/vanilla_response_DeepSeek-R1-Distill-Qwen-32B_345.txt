Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. They provided a detailed news article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. My task is to summarize this article into a concise 200-word summary, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I need to read through the entire article to understand the main points. The article discusses Trump's proposal to end the government shutdown by offering a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. The key reactions are from both parties: Democrats are largely critical, calling it a hostage situation, while Republicans are more supportive, seeing it as a step towards compromise.

I should identify the main elements: Trump's proposal, the Democratic criticism, Republican support, and the broader context of the shutdown's impact. I need to condense these points without getting too detailed. Also, I should mention the consequences of the shutdown, like federal workers not getting paid, to highlight the urgency.

I'll start by outlining the structure: introduce Trump's proposal, then summarize the Democratic opposition, followed by Republican support, and conclude with the implications of the shutdown. I need to ensure the summary is balanced, presenting both sides without bias.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll check that each key point is covered succinctly. Finally, I'll format it correctly with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension for 700,000 recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the proposal, calling it "hostage-taking" and insufficient, as it didn't provide permanent solutions for Dreamers and TPS recipients. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned Trump for prioritizing the wall over federal workers' well-being. Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Bob Menendez and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, accused Trump of exploiting the shutdown for political gain. Republicans, however, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling the proposal a "fair compromise." GOP leaders urged Democrats to end obstruction and negotiate, emphasizing the need to reopen the government to address the shutdown's impact on federal workers and the economy. The shutdown, now over a month, continues to affect 800,000 workers and highlight divisions over immigration and border security. END OF SUMMARY.
