SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and have rejected his proposal, calling it "one-sided" and "ineffective." They argue that Trump is using DACA recipients as "bargaining chips" and that his proposal does not provide a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, have praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate and have called on Democrats to match his willingness to find a compromise.
