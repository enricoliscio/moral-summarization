SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with mixed reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a barrier along the southern border. Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, criticized the proposal, accusing Trump of holding federal workers "hostage." They called for the government to be reopened before negotiations and dismissed the offer as "one-sided and ineffective." Other Democratic senators, such as Kristen Gillibrand and Bob Menendez, echoed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Whip Steve Scalise supported the proposal, calling on Democrats to come to the negotiating table. Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney also expressed support for the proposal, with Romney calling it a "reasonable, good faith proposal." Florida Senator Marco Rubio and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also viewed the offer positively. 

END OF SUMMARY.
