SUMMARY: President Trump's proposal to end the partial government shutdown by offering Democrats a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for funding for a border wall was met with strong opposition from Democratic lawmakers. They accused Trump of holding federal workers "hostage" and taking away DACA protections in the first place. Republicans, on the other hand, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to work with him. They argued that the proposal reflects a "fair compromise" and could resolve the impasse. Despite the differing views, there was a consensus on the need for a bipartisan solution and the negative impact of the shutdown on federal workers and the economy. However, with Democrats strongly opposed to Trump's proposal and Republicans defending it, the shutdown continues with no clear end in sight.

END OF SUMMARY.
