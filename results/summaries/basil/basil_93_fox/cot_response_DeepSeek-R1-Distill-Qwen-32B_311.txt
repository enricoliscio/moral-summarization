Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "hostage," "chaos," "untenable," "bad deal," "pointless," "unacceptable," "crisis," "sensless," "weakness," "strength," "good faith," "obstruction," and "reasonable" stand out. These words are used to convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, then outline the Democratic and Republican reactions. Democrats criticized the proposal as inadequate and morally wrong, while Republicans praised it as a reasonable step. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to reflect the author's perspective.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. I'll ensure that the moral framing is preserved by using the identified words where appropriate. 

Let me structure the summary: mention Trump's offer, the Democrats' strong opposition, the Republicans' support, and the ongoing shutdown's impact. I'll end by noting that the shutdown continues, highlighting the deadlock.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral nuances. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, but through the lens of the moral language used by the original author.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the proposal as inadequate, calling it a "bad deal" and accusing Trump of "holding the government hostage." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the plan, stating it failed to provide permanent solutions for Dreamers and TPS recipients. Schumer accused Trump of creating an "untenable" situation and urged reopening the government for bipartisan discussions. Other Democrats, like Sen. Bob Menendez, condemned the shutdown as "pointless" and criticized Trump for using Dreamers as "bargaining chips." Republicans, however, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling the proposal a "fair compromise" and Sen. Mitt Romney describing it as a "reasonable, good faith offer." The shutdown continued as Democrats demanded an end to hostage-taking and Republicans pushed for border security funding. END OF SUMMARY.
