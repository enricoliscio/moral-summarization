Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump offered a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for a border wall, which Democrats criticized as holding the government hostage. They wanted a permanent solution, not temporary fixes. Key Democrats like Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer, and others were against it, calling it ineffective. On the Republican side, McConnell and others praised the proposal as a fair compromise and urged Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown was affecting federal workers, and both sides wanted the government to reopen before discussing further solutions.

I need to capture the key elements: Trump's proposal, the Democratic opposition, Republican support, the impact of the shutdown, and the call for reopening the government before further talks. I should structure this clearly, making sure it's under 200 words.

Let me start drafting: Trump proposed a DACA extension and funding for the wall, but Democrats rejected it as a hostage situation. They wanted permanent solutions, not temporary. Republicans supported the proposal as a compromise. Both sides agreed the shutdown was hurting workers and wanted the government to reopen to negotiate.

I should make sure each sentence is concise and covers the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to end with the required tokens.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.
