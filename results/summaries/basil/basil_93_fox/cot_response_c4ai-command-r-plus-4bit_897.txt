SUMMARY:
President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with sharp reactions from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Many Democrats accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers *hostage* and criticized his proposal as *one-sided* and *ineffective*. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lamented Trump's lack of *sympathy* for federal workers facing *uncertainty* due to the *chaos* of the shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called the proposal *hostage taking*. Democrats insisted that Trump must *stop holding the government hostage* and *end the shutdown* immediately. They argued that a *legitimate negotiation* could proceed after the government reopens. In contrast, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to *negotiate* and compromise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described the proposal as a *fair compromise*, while Republican Whip Steve Scalise urged Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate and put an end to their *obstruction*. Senator Mitt Romney called it a *reasonable* and *good faith proposal*, and Senator Marco Rubio viewed it as a *very reasonable offer*. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also deemed the immigration offer *reasonable*. The divergent reactions highlight the moral dimensions of the debate, with Democrats emphasizing the harm caused by the shutdown and Republicans lauding Trump's attempt at compromise.
