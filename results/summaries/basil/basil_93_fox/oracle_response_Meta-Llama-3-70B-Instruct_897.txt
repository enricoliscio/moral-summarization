SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided" and "ineffective." They urged Trump to "stop holding government hostage" and "reopen" the government, allowing for a "civil discussion" and "bipartisan solutions." Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" offer.

Trump's proposal has been deemed a "bad deal" by many Democrats, who argue that he is "forcing" a "pointless shutdown" to pay for the border wall. They claim that he has "taken away" DACA protections and is now offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall. The shutdown has had severe "impacts" on federal workers, with many being "harmed" and "damaged" by the crisis.
