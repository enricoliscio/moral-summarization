Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. They also listed a bunch of morally charged words that the author used. My job is to create a summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping the moral perspective intact.

First, I should read through the article to get the gist. It's about Trump offering a deal to end the government shutdown. He's proposing a three-year DACA extension in exchange for funding a border wall. Democrats are really upset, calling it hostage-taking and ineffective. Republicans, on the other hand, are praising the compromise.

Now, looking at the list of moral words: shutdown, hostage, sympathy, chaos, etc. I need to make sure these are included where appropriate. For example, Democrats are saying Trump is holding the government hostage, so I should use that phrase. Also, terms like "untenable position" and "crisis" are important.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: Trump's offer, Democratic criticism, Republican support, and the impact on workers. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include the key moral terms.

Let me outline the key points:
1. Trump's proposal: DACA extension for wall funding.
2. Democratic reaction: hostage, ineffective, crisis.
3. Republican reaction: compromise, reasonable.
4. Impact on workers and government functions.

Now, I'll start drafting, making sure to incorporate the moral words. I'll mention the shutdown, the hostage situation, the crisis, and the ineffective measures. I'll also highlight the divide between the parties and the call for reopening the government.

I should check that I'm not missing any important moral terms. Words like "chaos," "untenable," "hurting," "bad deal," and "crisis" should be included. Also, phrases like "serving the American people" and "damaged economy" are important.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure the summary flows well, includes all the key points, and maintains the moral framing. Let me make sure each sentence includes the necessary terms without making it sound forced.

I think I've covered all the main points and included most of the moral terms. Time to write the summary concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and ends with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year DACA extension in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats criticized the plan, calling it "hostage-taking" and "ineffective," accusing Trump of forcing federal workers into an "untenable" situation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued the proposal lacked "sympathy" for affected workers and failed to provide a "permanent solution." Democrats also condemned the "crisis" caused by Trump's actions, labeling the deal "bad" and "one-sided." Republicans, however, praised the proposal as a "reasonable" compromise, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling it a "fair" step toward addressing immigration issues. The shutdown, they argued, was "hurting" millions and damaging the economy. Both sides agreed the government must reopen for "constructive" discussions to resume, with Democrats emphasizing the need to "stop holding government hostage" and Republicans urging Democrats to "negotiate in good faith." The impasse continued as the shutdown dragged on, leaving federal workers "without" paychecks and the nation's economy "damaged." END OF SUMMARY.
