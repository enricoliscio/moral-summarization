SUMMARY:
President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has drawn sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. However, top Democratic lawmakers accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided" and "ineffective." They argued that Trump's offer was a "bad deal" and that he was using DACA recipients as "bargaining chips" in a "pointless shutdown." In contrast, Republican lawmakers praised the president for his willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal "reasonable" and a "good faith" effort to reopen the government. END OF SUMMARY.
