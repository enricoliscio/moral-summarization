END OF STEP 1

SUMMARY: President Trump's compromise package to end the partial government shutdown sparked sharp reactions from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In his televised address, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for funding for his proposed border wall with Mexico. Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, criticized Trump's proposal, accusing him of holding federal workers hostage and offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall. They called for an end to the shutdown and a return to negotiations, with Pelosi calling the proposal a "non-starter" and Schumer deeming it "one-sided and ineffective." Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and compromise. Senate Majority Leader McConnell commended the president for taking bipartisan steps towards addressing immigration issues and called the proposal a "fair compromise." Other Republicans, such as Senator Susan Collins, urged Democrats to engage in constructive debate to resolve the stalemate and end the shutdown. The divide between the two parties remains stark, with Democrats refusing to support Trump's wall and Republicans praising his efforts.
