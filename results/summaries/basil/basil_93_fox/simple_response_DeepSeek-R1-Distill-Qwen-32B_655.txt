Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's immigration compromise and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, so I need to make sure that the summary reflects the moral arguments presented by each side.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Trump offered a three-year extension for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats are really against this, calling it hostage-taking because they feel Trump is forcing them into a bad deal by keeping the government shut down. They argue that Dreamers and TPS recipients shouldn't be bargaining chips. On the other hand, Republicans are praising Trump for making a compromise and trying to negotiate.

I need to capture the moral outrage from the Democrats and the support from Republicans. The Democrats are upset because they think Trump is using federal workers as hostages, and they want the government to reopen before any negotiations. Republicans, however, see this as a good faith effort and a step towards compromise.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's proposal, the Democratic response (criticizing it as hostage-taking), and the Republican support. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear that each side has their own moral stance.

Let me start drafting: President Trump proposed a three-year DACA extension for 700,000 recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats criticized this as hostage-taking, arguing that federal workers and Dreamers shouldn't be bargaining chips. They want the government to reopen first. Republicans, however, praised Trump's willingness to compromise, seeing it as a good step towards immigration reform.

Wait, that's a bit too short. Maybe add a bit more about the shutdown's impact and the Democrats' stance on not needing the shutdown for negotiations. Also, mention that Republicans believe this is a fair compromise.

Putting it all together: President Trump offered a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for a border wall, but Democrats called it hostage-taking, emphasizing that federal workers and Dreamers shouldn't be bargaining chips. They want the shutdown ended before any deal. Republicans, however, praised Trump's compromise, viewing it as a step toward immigration reform and border security.

I think that captures the moral framing from both sides. Let me check the word count. It's around 100 words, so I can add a bit more detail without exceeding 200. Maybe mention the humanitarian crisis and the economic impact as points from Democrats and the need for compromise from Republicans.

Final summary: President Trump proposed a three-year DACA extension and $5.7 billion for a border wall, but Democrats criticized it as hostage-taking, arguing federal workers and Dreamers shouldn't be bargaining chips. They called for the shutdown to end before negotiations. Republicans praised Trump's compromise, seeing it as a step toward immigration reform and border security, emphasizing the need for mutual concessions.
