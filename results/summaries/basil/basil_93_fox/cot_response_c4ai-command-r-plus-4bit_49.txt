SUMMARY:
President Trump presented an immigration compromise package in a televised address, offering to extend protections for DACA recipients in exchange for funding for a border wall. The proposal was met with sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers who accused Trump of holding federal workers *hostage* and causing *uncertainty* for them and their families. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected the proposal as *ineffective* and a *non-starter*, arguing that Trump was responsible for revoking DACA protections in the first place. They called for the *shutdown* to end before any negotiations could take place. Other Democratic senators, like Bob Menendez and Kristen Gillibrand, echoed these sentiments, calling the *shutdown* *pointless*. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Susan Collins characterized the proposal as a fair *compromise*. Senator Marco Rubio described it as a *reasonable* offer, urging Democrats to work with the president to end the *shutdown*. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also supported the proposal, calling on Democratic leaders to accept the *reasonable* offer. The divide in reactions highlights the ongoing partisan stalemate over immigration and border security, with Democrats and Republicans unable to reach an agreement to end the prolonged *shutdown*.
END OF SUMMARY.
