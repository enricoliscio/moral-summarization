SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump's proposal, which offers a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, has been criticized by Democrats as "holding government and federal workers hostage." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of forcing a "pointless shutdown" and "hurting" federal workers, calling his proposal "one-sided" and "ineffective." Democrats argue that Trump is "taking away" DACA protections and "eliminating" TPS programs, creating a "humanitarian crisis" at the border. In contrast, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" offer. However, Democrats insist that the government must "reopen" before negotiations can proceed, citing the "chaos" and "impacts" of the shutdown on federal workers and the economy. END OF SUMMARY.
