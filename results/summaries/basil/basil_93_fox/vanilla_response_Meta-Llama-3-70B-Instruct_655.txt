SUMMARY:

President Trump has proposed a compromise to end the partial government shutdown, offering Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. However, top Democratic lawmakers have rejected the proposal, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage." They argue that the proposal does not provide a permanent solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients and is a "bad deal." Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are calling for the government to be reopened before negotiations can proceed. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, have praised the president for his willingness to negotiate, with some calling on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to find a compromise.

END OF SUMMARY.
