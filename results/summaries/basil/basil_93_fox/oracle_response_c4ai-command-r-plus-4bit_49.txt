SUMMARY: President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown was met with disdain by Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of holding federal workers hostage and causing chaos. Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer called Trump's proposal one-sided and ineffective, and demanded that he first end the shutdown and stop hurting federal workers. House Majority Leader Hoyer echoed similar sentiments, urging Trump to stop taking the government hostage. Democratic Senators Gillibrand, Menendez, and Coons also criticized Trump for his handling of DACA and TPS recipients, with Gillibrand calling his offer a bad deal. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader McConnell commended Trump for taking bipartisan steps towards addressing immigration issues, while Republican Whip Scalise called on Democrats to end their obstruction and negotiate. Senator Collins expressed hope for a constructive debate, and Senator Romney called Trump's proposal reasonable. Senator Rubio and House Republican Leader McCarthy also viewed Trump's offer positively, urging Democrats to work with the president to reach an agreement.
END OF SUMMARY.
