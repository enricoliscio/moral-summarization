Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump's immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. He offered a three-year extension for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. 

The reaction from Democrats is negative. They call it holding the government hostage. Pelosi and Schumer are critical, saying it's not a real compromise. Pelosi mentions federal workers' uncertainty, and Schumer points out that Trump took away protections first. Other Democrats like Hoyer and Gillibrand also criticize the proposal as bad deals.

On the Republican side, McConnell praises the compromise, saying it's fair. Others like Scalise, Collins, Romney, Rubio, and McCarthy support it, urging Democrats to negotiate. 

So, the summary should include Trump's proposal, the Democratic criticism, and Republican support. Keep it concise, under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.
