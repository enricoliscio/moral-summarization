SUMMARY:
President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has drawn sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. Democratic lawmakers accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided" and "ineffective." They argued that Trump's offer was a "bad deal" and that he was using DACA recipients as "bargaining chips." Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to match his "reasonable" offer. The standoff continues, with Democrats demanding that the government be reopened before negotiations can begin. END OF SUMMARY.
