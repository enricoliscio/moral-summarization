SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a border wall. However, top Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and criticized his proposal as "one-sided and ineffective." They urged Trump to reopen the government and then negotiate a bipartisan solution. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump for his willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to match his willingness to find a compromise.

END OF SUMMARY.
