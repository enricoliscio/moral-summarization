SUMMARY:

President Trump's immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown has been met with sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump offered a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and rejected the proposal as "one-sided and ineffective." They argued that Trump's offer was not a compromise, but rather a attempt to use DACA and TPS recipients as bargaining chips. Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate and called on Democrats to match his efforts. The moral framing of the article suggests that Trump's actions are irresponsible and harmful, while Democrats are fighting for the rights and dignity of federal workers and immigrants.

END OF SUMMARY.
