SUMMARY:
President Trump's immigration compromise package has sparked sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Trump's proposal, which includes a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, has been met with disdain from top Democratic lawmakers. They accuse Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage" and creating "chaos" with the partial government shutdown. Democrats argue that Trump's proposal is a "bad deal" and that he is using DACA recipients as "bargaining chips" in his push for a border wall. In contrast, Republican lawmakers have praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, calling his proposal a "reasonable" and "good faith" offer. The stalemate continues, with Democrats refusing to budge until the government is reopened, and Republicans urging them to put aside their "personal dislike" of the president and negotiate.
