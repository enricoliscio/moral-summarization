SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a compromise package to end the partial government shutdown, offering Democrats a three-year extension of protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall with Mexico. The proposal was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accused Trump of holding federal workers "hostage." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer rejected the proposal as "a non-starter" and "one-sided," respectively. Other Democratic lawmakers, including Steny Hoyer, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bob Menendez, echoed similar sentiments. On the other hand, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell commended the president for taking "bipartisan steps," while Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to negotiate. Sen. Susan Collins expressed hope for a "constructive debate," and Sen. Mitt Romney called the proposal "reasonable." Sen. Marco Rubio and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also viewed the offer positively.
END OF SUMMARY.
