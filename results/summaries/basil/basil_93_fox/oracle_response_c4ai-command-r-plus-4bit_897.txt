SUMMARY: President Trump's proposal to end the government shutdown was met with disdain by Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of taking federal workers and immigrants "hostage." They criticized his offer of temporary protections for DACA recipients in exchange for border wall funding as "one-sided" and "ineffective." Nancy Pelosi called for the government to be reopened, emphasizing that federal workers face uncertainty due to the "TrumpShutdown." Chuck Schumer and other Democrats echoed similar sentiments, urging Trump to stop "hurting" federal workers and their families. They pushed for a "civil discussion" on border security and comprehensive immigration reform. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, with Mitch McConnell commending him for taking "bipartisan steps." They called on Democrats to put aside their "obstruction" and work towards securing the border. Marco Rubio and Kevin McCarthy described Trump's offer as "reasonable," urging Democrats to accept the deal and end the "shutdown."
END OF SUMMARY.
