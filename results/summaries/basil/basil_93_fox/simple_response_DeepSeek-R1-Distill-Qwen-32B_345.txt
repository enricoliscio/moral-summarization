Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Trump's immigration compromise to end the government shutdown. He offered a three-year DACA extension and some TPS protections in exchange for $5.7 billion for the border wall. Democrats are reacting negatively, calling it hostage-taking and ineffective. They argue that Dreamers shouldn't be bargaining chips. Some Republicans support Trump's proposal as a good faith effort. The article seems to frame Trump's offer as coercive, with Democrats emphasizing the moral issue of using federal workers and immigrants as hostages. I need to capture that moral perspective in the summary. I should mention the key points: Trump's offer, the Democratic criticism, the Republican support, and the moral implications. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed a three-year DACA extension and TPS protections in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall to end the government shutdown. Democrats criticized the offer as coercive, calling it "hostage-taking" and ineffective, arguing Dreamers and TPS recipients should not be bargaining chips. Senate Minority Leader Schumer and House Speaker Pelosi condemned the proposal, emphasizing the need to reopen the government before negotiations. Democrats accused Trump of creating a humanitarian crisis and demanded a permanent solution. Republican leaders, including McConnell and Rubio, praised Trump's willingness to negotiate, framing the proposal as a fair compromise. The article highlights the moral conflict over using federal workers and immigrants as leverage, with Democrats opposing the deal as coercive and Republicans viewing it as a step toward reform. END OF SUMMARY.
