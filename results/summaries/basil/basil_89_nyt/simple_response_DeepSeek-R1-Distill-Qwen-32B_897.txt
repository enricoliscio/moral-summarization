Alright, I need to summarize the given news article, preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigning over President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Mattis was seen as a stabilizing force, especially given Trump's unpredictability. His resignation is a significant event because it's the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980. The moral framing here is Mattis's belief in the importance of alliances and his concern that Trump's approach undermines American influence.

I should highlight Mattis's role as a stabilizing figure, his reasons for resigning, the impact on U.S. foreign policy, and the broader implications of his departure. Also, mention the context of the administration's instability and the reactions from Congress and others.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting into too much detail. Make sure to include Mattis's key arguments about alliances, the specific decisions he opposed, and the significance of his resignation.

Let me structure it: start with Mattis's resignation, his reasons, the context of Trump's decisions, the impact on national security, and the reactions. Conclude with the broader implications for the administration and U.S. foreign policy.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, maintaining the moral perspective that Mattis had about the importance of alliances and strategic competition.

Okay, putting it all together now, making sure it's concise and captures the essence of the article.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a stabilizing figure in Trump's administration, viewed his role as protecting U.S. troops and upholding alliances. He believed Trump's approach weakened American influence and power, particularly in the context of global competition with Russia and China. Mattis's resignation marks the first major cabinet departure over national security since 1980 and reflects his strong stance on the importance of alliances like NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition. His departure leaves the administration's national security in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton, amid growing instability and a potential government shutdown. Mattis's decision highlights the tension between Trump's unpredictability and the need for a coherent foreign policy, with many in Congress and the military viewing his resignation as a loss for U.S. leadership and stability.
