SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly expressed his commitment to protecting American troops and maintaining strong alliances. However, he felt that Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and his approach to global power dynamics were misaligned with his views. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted the importance of treating allies with respect and recognizing Russia and China as adversaries. He also emphasized the value of NATO and the coalition fighting ISIS, which Trump had just abandoned. The departure of Mattis leaves the Trump administration without a key figure who was seen as a stabilizing force and a protector against impulsive decisions. The resignation underscores the growing turmoil within the administration, as Mattis joins a list of high-profile departures.

END OF SUMMARY.
