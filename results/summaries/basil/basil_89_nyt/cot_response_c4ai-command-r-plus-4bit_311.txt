SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, widely seen as a figure of stability in the Trump administration, resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly expressed his belief in the importance of respecting and treating allies with cleareyed determination, especially when faced with malign adversaries and strategic competitors. His resignation letter, which condemned Trump's destructive approach to American influence and power, was a sharp rebuke of the president's mercurial and unpredictable nature. Mattis felt that the president's rejection of longstanding alliances and relationships was misguided and that his own views on providing effective leadership to allies were strongly held and worth resigning over. He believed that Russia and China posed a significant threat and that withdrawing troops from Syria would abandon allies and cede critical territory to these adversaries. Mattis's departure shocked officials and left many praising his loyalty and service as a beloved protector of American troops. His resignation highlighted the growing concerns over the president's rejection of traditional alliances and the potential consequences for American power and influence globally.
