SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly expressed his commitment to protecting American troops and working with allies, which clashed with Trump's unpredictable and isolationist approach to foreign policy. Mattis' resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's stance, emphasizing the importance of treating allies with respect and recognizing Russia and China as strategic competitors. The departure of Mattis, who was widely seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, has sparked concerns about the direction of national security policy and the potential for further turmoil within the Trump administration. The split between Mattis and Trump had been growing for months, with Mattis quietly resisting some of Trump's more controversial proposals. The resignation highlights the increasing isolation of the President and the growing concern among lawmakers and officials about the direction of the country's foreign policy. 

END OF SUMMARY.
