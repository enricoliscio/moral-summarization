SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the president's rejection of international alliances and his approach to the world as "destructive" to American influence and power. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the "concessions" necessary to work with a "mercurial" president. However, Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria was a "step too far" for Mattis, who believed it would "abandon" Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and "cede" critical territory to Russia and Iran. Mattis's resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's approach, which he saw as "scary" and "sad" for America. END OF SUMMARY.
