SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a lack of respect for allies and a failure to recognize strategic competitors like Russia and China. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly warned against abandoning Kurdish fighters and ceding territory to Russia and Iran. His resignation letter condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power. Mattis's decision was seen as a sad day for America, with Senator Ben Sasse calling it a "scary" development. The move leaves a power vacuum in the Trump administration, with Mattis being the last of the old-guard national security team. END OF SUMMARY.
