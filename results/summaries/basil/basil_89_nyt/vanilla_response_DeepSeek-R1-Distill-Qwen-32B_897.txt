Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis resigning as Defense Secretary. Let me read through the article to understand the key points. 

First, Mattis resigned because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his approach to international alliances. He felt that Trump's actions were harmful to U.S. interests and global influence. Mattis had been a stabilizing force in Trump's administration, especially with his experience and the respect he had from both allies and adversaries. 

The article mentions that Mattis tried to persuade Trump to keep troops in Syria but was unsuccessful. His resignation comes at a time when the administration is facing other challenges, like a potential government shutdown and a market slump. Mattis was the last of the old national security team, so his departure leaves the administration in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton. 

Also, Mattis was a key figure in shaping the defense strategy that focused on countering Russia and China. His departure is significant because it's the first major resignation over a national security issue since 1980. The article also notes that Mattis's approach to defense was about deterrence and working with allies, which contrasts with Trump's more unilateral decisions. 

I should make sure to include the main reasons for his resignation, his role in the administration, the implications of his departure, and the context of the current political climate. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's a clear summary of the article.
