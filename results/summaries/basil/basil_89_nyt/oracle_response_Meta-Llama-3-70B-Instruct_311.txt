SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a rejection of international alliances and a lack of respect for allies. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly tried to balance Trump's unpredictable behavior, but the Syria withdrawal was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power, and emphasized the importance of providing effective leadership to alliances. Mattis also criticized Trump's decision to abandon Kurdish fighters and cede critical territory to Russia and Iran. The resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and a deep market slump worsened over fears of continuing government turmoil. Mattis's departure marks the end of an era of stability in the Trump administration, leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton.
