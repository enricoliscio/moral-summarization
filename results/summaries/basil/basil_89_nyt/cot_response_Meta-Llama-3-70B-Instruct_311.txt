SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the president's rejection of international alliances and his "destructive" approach to the world. Mattis, a respected and "beloved" figure, had repeatedly tried to persuade Trump to reverse his decision, but was rebuffed. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's approach as "destructive" to American influence and power, and criticized the president's failure to recognize the importance of competition with Russia and China. Mattis's resignation was seen as a "sad" day for America, and a loss of an "island of stability" in the Trump administration. His departure leaves a power vacuum in national security, with Trump's decisions now unchecked. END OF SUMMARY.
