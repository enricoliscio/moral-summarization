Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a detailed news article about Jim Mattis's resignation and want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and second, write a summary preserving those moral terms.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "protest," "unpredictable," "balance," "concessions," "rebuffed," "respect," "malign," "strategic," "adversaries," "chaos," "stability," "sad," "betrayal," "derided," "alliances," "ally," "cede," "deter," "torture," "allying," "detriment," "treachery," "adult," "treason," "slow-walked," "ban," "parade." I need to make sure each of these words reflects a moral judgment or evaluation.

For the summary, I should condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll focus on Mattis's resignation due to Trump's Syria withdrawal, his concerns about alliances and adversaries, and the impact on national security. I'll also mention his role as a stabilizing force and the broader implications of his departure. I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it too verbose.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key points: Mattis's protest, the specific issues he had with Trump's decisions, the reaction from Congress, the historical context of his resignation, and the implications for U.S. foreign policy and military strategy. I'll make sure to include terms like "protest," "unpredictable," "balance," "concessions," "respect," "adversaries," "chaos," "sad," "betrayal," "strategic," "deter," "treason," and "slow-walked" to maintain the moral framing.

I also need to keep the summary concise, so I'll avoid unnecessary details and focus on the main events and moral implications. It's important to convey that Mattis's resignation signifies a significant shift in the administration's approach to national security and international relations, emphasizing the moral and strategic concerns he held.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and effectively captures the moral dimensions of the article. I'll make sure each morally framed word is appropriately included and that the summary accurately reflects the original text's tone and content.

**SUMMARY:**

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a respected figure seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, viewed Trump’s approach as destructive to U.S. influence and power. He emphasized the importance of alliances, such as NATO, and criticized Trump’s disregard for global competition with Russia and China. Mattis’s resignation marked a significant shift in the administration’s national security strategy, with critics calling it a loss of stability and a blow to American leadership. His departure leaves the Pentagon in the hands of new leaders, amid concerns about the administration’s handling of foreign policy and military strategy. Mattis’s decision to step down highlighted a deepening divide between his values of respect for allies and strategic clarity, and Trump’s mercurial approach to governance. END OF SUMMARY.
