SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a "step too far" in the president's rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect the US' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary to serve under a "mercurial" president. However, Trump's decision to abandon Kurdish fighters and cede critical territory to Russia and Iran was the last straw. Mattis's resignation letter condemned Trump's approach to the world as "destructive" to American influence and power, and criticized the president's failure to recognize the importance of competition with Russia and China. Mattis's departure leaves a void in the Trump administration, which is now characterized by "chaos" and a lack of stability. END OF SUMMARY.
