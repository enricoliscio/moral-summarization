SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly clashed with the president over his approach to national security and global alliances. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's disregard for allies and his failure to recognize the competition for global power with Russia and China. Mattis' resignation came as a shock to officials at the Pentagon and was met with concern by lawmakers, who viewed him as a stabilizing force within the administration. His departure leaves the Trump administration without a key figure who was respected by allies and adversaries alike. It also highlights the growing isolation of the United States on the world stage as Trump pursues an "America First" agenda. The Pentagon is now preparing for a drawdown of forces in Afghanistan, with 7,000 troops expected to be withdrawn in the coming months. Trump announced that Mattis will leave at the end of February and that a replacement will be named soon. Mattis' resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of the president's approach to national security and international relations.
END OF SUMMARY.
