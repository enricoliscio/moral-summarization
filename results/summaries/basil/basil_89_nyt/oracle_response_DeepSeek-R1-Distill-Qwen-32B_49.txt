Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral language involved.

The article is about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigning because he disagreed with President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his approach to international alliances. Mattis was seen as a stabilizing force in an administration that's often seen as unpredictable. He felt Trump's actions were damaging to U.S. influence and security, especially regarding alliances like NATO and the fight against ISIS.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used, which are listed. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence of Mattis's resignation and the moral implications.

I should start by stating Mattis's resignation and the reasons. Then mention his role as a stabilizing figure. Highlight his concerns about Trump's decisions affecting U.S. alliances and security. Include the impact on the administration and the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy.

I'll make sure to use words like "balance," "withdraw," "reject," "protect," "step," "reverse," "treat," "clear-eyed," "shutdown," "turmoil," "pay," "withdrawn," "ending," "chaos," "war," "plot," "kill," "underpinned," "hostages," "tragedy," "destructive," "influence," "leadership," "derided," "abandoned," "sight," "consistent," "author," "take," "pull," "withdrawal," "abandoning," "ceding," "decision," "departure," "selection," "protector," "commanded," "overseeing," "action," "deter," "working," "benefit," "torturing," "deteriorated," "treason," "oversaw," "supervising," "firing," "banning," "starting," "putting," "buried."

I need to weave these words naturally into the summary without making it sound forced. The summary should flow logically, starting from Mattis's resignation, his reasons, the impact on the administration, and the broader implications.

Let me draft a summary that includes these elements. I'll make sure it's under 200 words and captures the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances, which Mattis viewed as destructive to American influence and security. Mattis, seen as a stabilizing force, believed his role as defense secretary required balancing Trump's unpredictability while protecting U.S. interests. His resignation followed Trump's announcement to withdraw troops, a decision Mattis saw as abandoning allies and ceding territory to adversaries like Russia and Iran. Mattis criticized Trump's approach to global leadership, emphasizing the importance of alliances like NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition. His departure, the first by a leading cabinet member over national security since 1980, highlights growing turmoil in the administration. Mattis was a respected protector of U.S. troops and a defender of alliances, but his relationship with Trump deteriorated as he opposed several of Trump's initiatives. His resignation leaves the administration in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton, raising concerns about the future of U.S. foreign policy and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
