Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Mattis resigned because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the rejection of alliances. He felt it was a step too far and wanted to protect US troops and interests. The article mentions the impact on alliances, like NATO and the coalition against ISIS. Mattis was seen as a stabilizing force, and his departure leaves the administration in turmoil. There's also mention of the government shutdown and market slump. Mattis's resignation was significant, the first in decades over a major national security issue. He believed in strong alliances and leadership, which Trump's approach was seen as destructive. The Pentagon didn't defend the withdrawal, and Mattis's refusal to endorse it led to his resignation.

Now, I need to incorporate as many of the provided moral words as possible. Words like "balance," "withdraw," "rejection," "protect," "step," "reverse," etc., should be included. I'll structure the summary to highlight Mattis's role as a balance, his resignation in protest, the withdrawal from Syria, the rejection of alliances, protecting troops, the step too far, attempts to reverse the decision, and the turmoil it caused. I'll also mention the chaos, the impact on the war, and the moral implications of abandoning allies and ceding territory. Mattis's belief in leadership and the consequences of Trump's decisions should be emphasized.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key points: Mattis's resignation, his reasons, the impact on alliances, the reaction from Congress, and the broader implications for US security. I'll make sure to use the moral words naturally within the summary without forcing them.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many moral terms as possible. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to fit everything in without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances, viewing it as a step too far that undermined American leadership and influence. Mattis, a stabilizing force in the administration, had long protected U.S. troops and interests, but Trump's approach to global affairs, including the withdrawal from Syria and deriding NATO, conflicted with Mattis's core beliefs in treating allies with respect and countering adversaries like Russia and China. Mattis's resignation marked a significant departure from the alliances that underpinned U.S. security since World War II, leaving the administration in turmoil. His letter criticized Trump's actions as destructive to American power and leadership, emphasizing the importance of alliances and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition. Mattis's departure, along with the Pentagon's planned withdrawal from Afghanistan, raised concerns about abandoning allies and ceding territory to adversaries. His resignation was the first by a leading cabinet member over a major national security issue since 1980, highlighting the chaos and instability in Trump's administration. END OF SUMMARY.
