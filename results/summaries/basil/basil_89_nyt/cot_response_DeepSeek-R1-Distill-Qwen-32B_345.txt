Okay, I need to tackle this user query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, the user provided a detailed news article about Jim Mattis's resignation. My first step is to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. I'll go through the text and pick out words that imply judgment or ethical considerations. Words like "unpredictable," "protest," "mercurial," "rebuffed," "scary," "sad," "chaos," "derided," "adversaries," "authoritarian," "torturing," "deter," "slow-walked," "costly," "lauded," "tragedy," "betrayal," "dishonor," "disloyalty," "dishonesty," "corruption," "incompetence," "inefficiency," "irresponsibility," "negligence," "weakness," "cowardice," "treachery," "abandonment," "cowardice," "dishonesty," "deceit," "betrayal," "failure," "neglect," "abuse," "dishonor," "disloyalty," "dishonesty," "corruption," "incompetence," "inefficiency," "irresponsibility," "negligence," "weakness," "cowardice," "treachery," "abandonment," "cowardice," "dishonesty," "deceit," "betrayal," "failure," "neglect," "abuse." 

Wait, that seems too many. Maybe I should focus on the most impactful ones. The article mentions "protest," "mercurial," "rebuffed," "chaos," "derided," "adversaries," "authoritarian," "torturing," "deter," "slow-walked," "costly," "lauded," "tragedy," "betrayal," "dishonor," "disloyalty," "dishonesty," "corruption," "incompetence," "inefficiency," "irresponsibility," "negligence," "weakness," "cowardice," "treachery," "abandonment." I think these capture the moral aspects.

Next, I need to write a summary using as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should highlight Mattis's resignation due to Trump's decisions, the moral implications, and the impact on national security. I'll make sure to include key points like his role as a stabilizing force, the withdrawal from Syria, and the broader implications for alliances and national security strategy.

I should structure the summary to first state Mattis's resignation, then the reasons, his moral stance, the reactions, and the significance of his departure. Keeping it concise but comprehensive, ensuring the moral framing words are included to reflect the original article's tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances, citing a divergence in views on treating allies with respect and addressing global competitors like Russia and China. Mattis, a stabilizing figure in the Trump administration, viewed his role as protecting U.S. troops and maintaining alliances, but Trump’s approach to global leadership and withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan were seen as damaging to American influence. Mattis’s resignation, the first by a leading cabinet member over national security since 1980, highlights the administration’s instability and the growing tension between Mattis’s commitment to alliances and Trump’s mercurial decisions. His departure leaves the Pentagon’s future in the hands of less-experienced leaders, raising concerns about the U.S. military’s global posture and the administration’s handling of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
