Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific structure: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using those words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Jim Mattis resigning as Defense Secretary due to disagreements with Trump's decisions, particularly withdrawing troops from Syria. The article highlights Mattis's commitment to alliances and his frustration with Trump's approach. 

For STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph. Words like "unpredictable," "protest," "concessions," "mercurial," "rejection," "hurting," "slump," "chaos," "stability," "adversaries," "allies," "derided," "censure," "torturing," "deter,"
