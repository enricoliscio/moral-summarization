SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were seen as a balance to President Trump's unpredictable nature, resigned on Thursday. This was an extraordinary rebuke of the President, as Mattis felt his responsibility to protect U.S. troops was more important than making concessions to a mercurial president. Mattis' resignation, which came amidst government turmoil, was a protest against Trump's rejection of international alliances and his decision to withdraw troops from Syria. In his letter, Mattis condemned Trump's approach to the world, stating that it undermined American influence and power. The Defense Secretary's departure leaves the administration without a loyal and respected figure, as Mattis was widely praised for his experience and ability to work with allies. The split between the two men highlights the deterioration of their relationship, with Mattis no longer willing to acquiesce to the President's controversial decisions.
