SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a respected and experienced figure, saw his role as protecting the US troops and its alliances, while Trump favored an isolationist and unpredictable approach. Mattis' resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's destructive foreign policy, his disregard for allies, and his failure to recognize the global power competition with Russia and China. The split between Mattis and Trump had been brewing for months, with Mattis quietly resisting some of Trump's more controversial proposals. Mattis' departure leaves the Trump administration without a key figure who provided stability and a check on the president's impulsive decisions. His resignation is a warning to Americans about the dangers of Trump's erratic foreign policy and the potential consequences for US national security. END OF SUMMARY.
