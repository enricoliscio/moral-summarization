SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the importance of protecting allies and recognizing the threat of Russia and China. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but his views on international alliances and national security were at odds with the president's. In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the need for effective leadership of alliances, particularly the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and condemned Trump's approach as destructive to American influence and power. Mattis's resignation marks a significant shift in the Trump administration's national security team, leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton. The move has been met with concern from lawmakers, with Senator Mark Warner calling Mattis "an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration."
