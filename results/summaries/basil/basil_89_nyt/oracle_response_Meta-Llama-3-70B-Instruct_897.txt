SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a lack of respect for international alliances and a rejection of the importance of protecting the US' 1.3 million active-duty troops. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, believed it was his responsibility to provide effective leadership to US alliances and to be cleareyed about malign actors and strategic competitors. However, Trump's decision to abandon Kurdish fighters and cede critical territory to Russia and Iran was the last straw. Mattis's resignation letter condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power, and marked a sad day for America. The move leaves policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, and raises concerns about the US' ability to deter war and protect its allies. The departure of Mattis, a protector of the Pentagon and a voice of reason in the Trump administration, is a significant blow to the US' national security.
