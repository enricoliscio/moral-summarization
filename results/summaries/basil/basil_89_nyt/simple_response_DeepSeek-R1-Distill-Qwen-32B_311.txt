Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspective.

The article is about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigning due to President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his stance on international alliances. Mattis is portrayed as a stabilizing force in an administration that's seen as unpredictable. His resignation is a significant event, especially since it's the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980.

I should note the moral elements here. Mattis is shown as someone who values alliances, respects international commitments, and prioritizes the welfare of troops. His decision to resign highlights the conflict between his principles and Trump's policies. The article also mentions the broader implications, like the impact on U.S. influence and the reaction from Congress and other officials, which adds to the moral framing about the importance of these alliances.

I need to make sure the summary captures Mattis's dedication to his duties, his respect for allies, and his opposition to Trump's approach. Also, highlighting the contrast between Mattis's values and Trump's actions will preserve the moral aspect. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to show Mattis's integrity and the significance of his resignation in the context of U.S. foreign policy.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it includes all these elements without going into too much detail, while keeping the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a respected figure seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, viewed his role as protecting U.S. troops and upholding alliances, which he believed were essential for American security. His resignation letter criticized Trump's approach as harmful to U.S. influence, particularly regarding NATO and the fight against ISIS. Mattis, the last of Trump's original national security team, emphasized the importance of countering adversarial powers like Russia and China. His departure, the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980, reflects a growing divide between Trump's policies and traditional U.S. foreign policy principles. END OF SUMMARY.
