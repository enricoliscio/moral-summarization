SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday, citing President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a balance to Trump's unpredictable presidency, but decided that Trump's Syria decision was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the importance of treating allies with respect and being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors. Mattis's resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and a deep market slump worsened over fears of continuing government turmoil.

Mattis's departure marks the end of Trump's old-guard national security team, leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton. Mattis's resignation letter was the sharpest and most public protest from inside the Trump administration over the president's rejection of alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security since World War II.

END OF SUMMARY.
