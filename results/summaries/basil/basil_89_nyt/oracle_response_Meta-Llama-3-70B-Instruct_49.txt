SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a rejection of international alliances and a lack of respect for allies. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president. However, Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria was a step too far, and Mattis decided to step down from his position. In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote that his views on treating allies with respect and being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held. Mattis' resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil. The move was seen as a sad day for America, with Senator Ben Sasse calling it a loss of an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
