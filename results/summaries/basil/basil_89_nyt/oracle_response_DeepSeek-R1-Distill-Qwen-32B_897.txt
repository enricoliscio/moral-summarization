SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest against President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, citing the move as a step too far in a series of actions he viewed as destructive to American alliances and national security. Mattis, a stabilizing figure in the administration, had long protected the interests of U.S. troops despite Trump's unpredictable leadership. His resignation letter criticized Trump's approach to global affairs, emphasizing the importance of treating allies with respect and maintaining leadership in key alliances like NATO. Mattis also condemned the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish allies and ceding territory to Russia and Iran. His departure marks a significant shift in the administration's foreign policy, with critics calling it a sad day for America. Mattis, once seen as a protector against Trump's mercurial nature, was the last of the old-guard national security team, leaving policy in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton. His decision highlights the turmoil within the administration and the broader implications for U.S. influence and stability in the world. END OF SUMMARY.
