SUMMARY:
The resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has shocked officials and lawmakers alike, as he was widely seen as a stabilizing force in an unpredictable administration. Mattis's resignation letter, an extraordinary rebuke of President Trump, condemned the president's rejection of longstanding alliances and his destructive approach to American power and influence. Mattis, a respected and beloved figure in the Pentagon, believed in his responsibility to protect American troops and provide effective leadership to allies, even if it meant making concessions to a mercurial president. His core complaint was that Trump had lost sight of the global power competition with Russia and China, ceding critical territory to these authoritarian adversaries. The split between Mattis and Trump, once seemingly strong, deteriorated over months as Mattis quietly slow-walked or buried some of Trump's more controversial proposals in red tape. Mattis's resignation, along with the planned withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan, has left many worried about the future of American foreign policy and the stability of the administration.
