SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly expressed his commitment to protecting the United States' troops and upholding its alliances. However, he felt that Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and his overall approach to foreign policy undermined American power and influence. Mattis' resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's rejection of longstanding alliances and his failure to recognize the global power competition with Russia and China. The departure of Mattis, who was widely seen as a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, has caused concern among lawmakers and officials, who fear a further deterioration of the country's foreign relations and national security. Mattis' resignation highlights the growing discord between Trump and his advisers, and it remains to be seen who will replace him and how this decision will impact the country's future foreign policy decisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
