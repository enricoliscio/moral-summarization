SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the importance of respecting allies and recognizing strategic competitors. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but his views on national security and alliances were at odds with the President's. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power, highlighting the importance of NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition. Mattis's resignation is seen as a rebuke of Trump's rejection of international alliances and his failure to recognize the threat posed by Russia and China. The move has sparked concerns about the future of American national security and the stability of the Trump administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
