SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but ultimately decided that the president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis criticized Trump's approach to the world, saying it was destructive to American influence and power. Mattis also expressed concern about the withdrawal's impact on Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and the ceding of critical territory to Russia and Iran. Mattis's resignation marks a significant shift in the Trump administration's national security team, leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton.

END OF SUMMARY.
