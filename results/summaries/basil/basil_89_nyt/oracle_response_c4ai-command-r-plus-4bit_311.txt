SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, who was widely seen as a balance to Trump's unpredictability, felt that the decision to withdraw troops from Syria was a step too far and condemned Trump's approach as destructive to American influence and power. He believed in the importance of providing effective leadership to America's alliances and in treating allies with respect, while also being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors. Mattis also viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding territory to Russia and Iran. His resignation letter was an extraordinary rebuke of the president and a sharp, public protest of Trump's rejection of long-standing alliances. It left policy in the hands of the president's second secretary of state and third national security adviser. Mattis's relationship with Trump had deteriorated over months, with the president accusing Mattis of being a Democrat, akin to treason in the current administration. Mattis's departure leaves the Pentagon without a protector against a president who has shown little understanding of his role as commander-in-chief.
END OF SUMMARY.
