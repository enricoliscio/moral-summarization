Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigning in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. Mattis is resigning because he disagrees with Trump's Syria withdrawal and the approach to alliances. He's seen as a stabilizing force in an administration that's often seen as chaotic. The article mentions several morally charged words that I need to include in the summary, such as "balance," "withdraw," "rejection," "protect," etc.

I should start by identifying the main events: Mattis's resignation, his reasons, the impact on national security, and the reactions from Congress and others. I need to make sure the summary is concise, no more than 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

I'll structure the summary to first state Mattis's resignation and his reasons, then touch on the broader implications like the government shutdown and market slump. I should mention his role as a protector and the chaos in the administration. I'll also include his criticism of Trump's approach, the impact on alliances, and the reaction from Capitol Hill.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so words like "balance," "protect," "rejection," "step too far," "treat," "clear-eyed," "shutdown," "turmoil," "pay," "withdrawn," "ending," "chaos," "war," "plot," "kill," "underpinned," "hostages," "tragedy," "destructive," "influence," "leadership," "derided," "abandoned," "sight," "consistent," "author," "take," "pull," "withdrawal," "abandoning," "ceding," "decision," "departure," "selection," "protector," "commanded," "overseeing," "action," "deter," "working," "benefit," "torturing," "deteriorated," "treason," "oversaw," "supervising," "firing," "banning," "starting," "putting," "buried" should be incorporated naturally.

I'll make sure each sentence includes these terms where appropriate, without making the summary feel cluttered. For example, when talking about Mattis's role, I can use "protector" and "balance." When discussing his resignation, terms like "withdraw," "rejection," and "step too far" fit well.

I also need to keep the summary clear and to the point, ensuring that all critical points are covered without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to make sure I stay within 200 words.

Finally, I'll end the summary with the required tokens, making sure it's properly formatted.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances, citing the importance of "treating allies with respect" and maintaining "clear-eyed" strategic competition with adversaries like Russia and China. Mattis, seen as a "protector" of U.S. troops and a stabilizing force in a chaotic administration, described Trump's approach as "destructive" to American influence and leadership. His resignation, which came amid a government shutdown and market turmoil, marked a significant departure from the national security strategy he authored, emphasizing the need to counter "revisionist" powers. Mattis criticized Trump's withdrawal from Syria as abandoning allies and ceding territory to Russia and Iran, while also opposing the administration's "chaos" and "war" with jihadists. His departure leaves the U.S. national security policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, as the Pentagon prepares to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. Mattis's resignation was a sharp rebuke of Trump's policies, highlighting the growing divide between the president and his senior advisors. END OF SUMMARY.
