SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a rejection of international alliances and a lack of respect for allies. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly expressed concerns about the president's approach to global power and influence, particularly with regards to Russia and China. The resignation came as a shock to many, with Senator Mark Warner calling Mattis "an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration." Mattis's letter condemned Trump's approach as "destructive" to American influence and power, and highlighted the importance of providing effective leadership to alliances, such as NATO. The decision to pull out of Syria was seen as abandoning Kurdish fighters and ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran. Mattis's resignation marks a significant shift in the Trump administration's national security team, leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton. END OF SUMMARY.
