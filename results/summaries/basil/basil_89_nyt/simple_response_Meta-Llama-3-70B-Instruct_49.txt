SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the importance of treating allies with respect and being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect US troops as worth the concessions necessary to work with a mercurial president. However, Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria was a step too far, and Mattis decided to step down from his position. Mattis's resignation letter condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power, and praised the importance of alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security since WWII. The resignation is seen as a sharp rebuke of Trump's rejection of international alliances and a loss of stability in the administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
