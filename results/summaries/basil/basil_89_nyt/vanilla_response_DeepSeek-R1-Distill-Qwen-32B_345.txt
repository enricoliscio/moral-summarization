Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Jim Mattis resigning as Defense Secretary. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Mattis resigned because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the administration's approach to international alliances. He felt this was a step too far and that his values didn't align with Trump's anymore.

The article mentions that Mattis was seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, especially given Trump's unpredictable nature. His departure is significant because he was part of the old guard in Trump's national security team. Now, the administration is left with Pompeo and Bolton, who have different approaches.

Mattis emphasized the importance of alliances like NATO and the coalition against ISIS, which Trump has criticized or abandoned. He also believed in countering Russia and China, which seems to be a point of contention with Trump's policies.

Additionally, Mattis was against some of Trump's other proposals, like the Space Force and banning transgender troops, though he didn't openly oppose them. His resignation is notable because it's the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980.

The article also touches on the broader implications, like the government shutdown fears and the impact on military strategy, especially in Afghanistan and Syria. Mattis was seen as a reliable figure, and his departure leaves questions about the administration's direction.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Mattis's resignation reasons, his role in the administration, key points from his resignation letter, and the significance of his departure. I should also mention the impact on U.S. alliances and the strategic competition with Russia and China.

Let me structure it: Start with Mattis resigning over Syria withdrawal and alliances, his role as a stabilizing force, his views on NATO and counterterrorism, the significance of his departure, and the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy.

I should ensure the summary is concise, covers all main points, and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid getting too detailed on each point but make sure each key aspect is mentioned.
