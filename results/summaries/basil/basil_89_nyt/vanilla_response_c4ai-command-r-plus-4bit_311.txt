SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect US troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president. However, Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria was a step too far for Mattis, who felt that the move would abandon American allies and cede territory to Russia and Iran. Mattis's resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's approach to the world, condemning his rejection of alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security. It also highlighted the importance of competing with global powers like Russia and China, who want "a world consistent with their authoritarian model." Mattis's departure leaves policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, while the Pentagon prepares to draw down forces in Afghanistan. The split between Mattis and Trump had been deteriorating for months, with Mattis quietly slow-walking some of Trump's proposals.
END OF SUMMARY.
