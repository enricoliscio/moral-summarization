SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, who was widely seen as a balance to Trump's unpredictable behavior, believed that his responsibility to protect US troops was worth conceding to the president's mercurial behavior. However, Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria was a step too far. Mattis's resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's approach to the world, condemning his destructive influence on American power and leadership. Mattis also criticized Trump for losing sight of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who favor an authoritarian model. The departure of Mattis, who was respected by allies and adversaries alike, leaves the US national security team without an old-guard member and in a state of chaos. Trump's rejection of Mattis's advice and his decision to withdraw from Syria have been widely criticized, with some calling it a sad day for America and a scary step towards isolationism.
END OF SUMMARY.
