SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing a lack of respect for international alliances and a misguided approach to global power struggles. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but his views on national security and alliances were increasingly at odds with the president's. In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the importance of providing effective leadership to alliances, such as NATO, and condemned Trump's approach as destructive to American influence and power. Mattis's resignation marks a significant loss of stability and expertise in the Trump administration, and raises concerns about the president's ability to make informed national security decisions.

END OF SUMMARY.
