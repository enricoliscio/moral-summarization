SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly expressed his commitment to protecting American troops and treating allies with respect. He viewed the withdrawal from Syria as a betrayal of Kurdish fighters and other American allies and as a concession to Russia and Iran. Mattis's resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's approach to global power dynamics and his neglect of the competition with Russia and China. It also highlighted the importance of NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition. Mattis's relationship with Trump had deteriorated over time, with the President accusing Mattis of being a Democrat and Mattis quietly slowing down some of Trump's proposals. Mattis' resignation leaves the Trump administration without a key figure who was respected by allies and adversaries alike and who provided a counterbalance to the President's unpredictable behavior. His departure raises concerns about the future of American foreign policy and the potential for further instability within the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
