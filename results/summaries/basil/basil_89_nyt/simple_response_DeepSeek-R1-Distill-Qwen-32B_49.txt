Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis resigning as Defense Secretary. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

First, Mattis resigned because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the rejection of international alliances. He felt this was a step too far, despite trying to protect the troops under a mercurial president. The article mentions that Mattis was the last of Trump's old national security team, so his departure leaves the administration in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton. 

There's also context about Mattis's role as a stabilizing force in the administration, with Congress facing a shutdown and the market slump. Mattis's resignation is significant because it's the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980. He emphasized the importance of alliances like NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition, which Trump abandoned. 

His core complaint was that Trump lost sight of competing with Russia and China. Mattis authored a defense strategy targeting revisionist powers, which Trump didn't fully understand. The Syria withdrawal was seen as abandoning allies and giving ground to Russia and Iran. Pentagon officials didn't defend the decision publicly, and Mattis refused to endorse it, leading to his resignation.

The article also touches on Mattis's background, his respect among allies, and his approach to deterrence through a tough posture. His relationship with Trump deteriorated, with Trump even accusing him of being a Democrat. Mattis managed to slow-walk some of Trump's proposals, like banning transgender troops and creating a Space Force, by using red tape.

I need to make sure the summary captures Mattis's moral stance against Trump's policies, the significance of his resignation, and the impact on U.S. alliances and national security strategy. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral framing, such as Mattis's commitment to alliances and his opposition to Trump's approach.

Let me structure this: start with Mattis's resignation and reasons, mention his role as a stabilizing force, the significance of his departure, his complaints about Trump's policies, the impact on alliances, and the broader implications for U.S. security strategy. Make sure to include that this is the first major resignation over national security since 1980, emphasizing the moral stance against Trump's decisions.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in the details, like the dinner meetings or the Space Force, unless they're essential to the moral framing. Focus on his opposition to the Syria withdrawal, the abandonment of allies, and the shift away from traditional alliances. Also, mention the significance of his resignation in the context of the administration's direction.

Now, putting it all together concisely while preserving the moral elements. Make sure to include the key points: resignation due to Syria withdrawal, rejection of alliances, Mattis's commitment to protecting troops and alliances, the impact on U.S. global strategy, and the significance of his departure as a rare protest against national security decisions.
