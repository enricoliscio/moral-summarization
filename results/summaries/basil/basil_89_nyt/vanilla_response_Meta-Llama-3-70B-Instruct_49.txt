SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect the US' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president. However, Trump's decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power. Mattis also praised the "Defeat ISIS" coalition that Trump just abandoned in Syria and expressed concerns about abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran.
