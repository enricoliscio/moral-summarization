SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, who was widely seen as a balance to the unpredictable president, felt that Trump's decision to abandon Kurdish fighters and other American allies and cede territory to Russia and Iran was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's destructive approach to the world and his loss of sight of the importance of global power competition with Russia and China. This rebuke of the president came after months of deteriorating relations between the two, with Mattis often seen as the adult in the room to Trump's mercurial behavior. Mattis's resignation leaves the Trump administration without one of its most respected and stabilizing figures, and it has shocked officials at the Pentagon. His departure also comes as the Pentagon is preparing to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, further reducing American involvement in global conflicts. Mattis's resignation is a sharp reminder of the moral and strategic divide between the president and his former defense secretary, and it remains to be seen who Trump will select as a replacement to oversee the world's most powerful military.
END OF SUMMARY.
