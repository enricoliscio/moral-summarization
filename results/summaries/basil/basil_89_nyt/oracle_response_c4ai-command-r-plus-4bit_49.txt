SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, who was widely seen as a balance to Trump's unpredictability, felt that the president's decision to abandon Kurdish fighters and other American allies, as well as cede critical territory to Russia and Iran, was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's destructive approach to the world and his loss of sight of the importance of global power competition with Russia and China. Mattis's departure leaves the Trump administration without a key figure who was respected among allies and adversaries and who oversaw the world's most powerful military. His resignation is a sharp rebuke of Trump's rejection of longstanding American security alliances and relationships. It also highlights the chaos and turmoil within the administration, with policy now in the hands of Trump's second secretary of state and third national security adviser. The split between Mattis and Trump has been building for months, with the president accusing Mattis of being a Democrat and the relationship deteriorating. Mattis's departure leaves the Pentagon without a protector against a president who has a scant understanding of his role as commander-in-chief.
END OF SUMMARY.
