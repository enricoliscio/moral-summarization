SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, who was widely seen as a balance to Trump's unpredictability, believed that his responsibility was to protect US troops and provide effective leadership to allies. He made a last-ditch attempt to persuade Trump to reverse the Syria decision but was rebuffed. Mattis's resignation letter was a sharp rebuke of Trump's approach to global power competition and his treatment of allies. It condemned Trump's destructive influence on American power and his loss of sight in the competition with Russia and China. The resignation left a void in the national security team and shocked officials at the Pentagon. Trump's relationship with Mattis had deteriorated over time, with Trump accusing Mattis of being a Democrat, akin to treason. Mattis oversaw the world's most powerful military and supervised troops in war zones and deterred threats worldwide. His departure highlights the turmoil and chaos within the Trump administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
