Alright, I need to summarize this article about Jim Mattis resigning as Defense Secretary. The user wants a concise summary, so I'll focus on the main points.

First, Mattis resigned because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his approach to international alliances. That's a key point.

He was seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, so his departure is significant. I should mention that he was the last of Trump's original national security team.

The article also notes that this is the first major resignation over national security since 1980, which adds context about the rarity of such an event.

Mattis emphasized the importance of alliances like NATO and the fight against ISIS, which were undermined by Trump's decisions. That's another important point to include.

Additionally, Mattis's role in shaping the defense strategy against Russia and China is relevant, as Trump's approach didn't align with that.

I should also touch on the broader implications, like the government shutdown fears and the impact on U.S. global influence.

Finally, I'll keep the summary under 200 words, making sure it's clear and captures all the essential elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a respected figure seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, viewed Trump's approach as detrimental to American influence and global power competition with Russia and China. His resignation marked the first major departure by a cabinet member over national security since 1980. Mattis emphasized the importance of alliances like NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition, which Trump abandoned. His departure leaves the administration's national security in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton. Mattis's tenure was marked by his efforts to protect U.S. troops and his clashes with Trump over policy, including the Syria withdrawal, which he saw as abandoning allies and ceding territory to adversaries. His resignation reflects growing tensions within the administration and concerns about U.S. global leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
