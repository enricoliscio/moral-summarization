SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but felt he could no longer continue in his role due to Trump's actions. In his resignation letter, Mattis expressed his strong views on treating allies with respect and being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors. He will leave his position at the end of February. Mattis's resignation is seen as a significant blow to the Trump administration, with many lawmakers and officials expressing concern about the impact on national security.
