His resignation marked a significant departure from the administration's national security strategy, particularly in light of growing competition with Russia and China. Mattis emphasized the importance of alliances like NATO and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition, which Trump had undermined. His exit, the first by a cabinet member over a major national security issue since 1980, underscored growing tensions within the administration and highlighted Mattis's role as a stabilizing force amidst Trump's unpredictable leadership.
