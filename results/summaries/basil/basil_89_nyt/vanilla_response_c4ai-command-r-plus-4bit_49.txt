SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had previously expressed his commitment to protecting the United States' active-duty troops and his views on the importance of treating allies with respect. In his resignation letter, Mattis criticized Trump's approach to global power dynamics, emphasizing the value of providing effective leadership to alliances like NATO. He also highlighted the competition with Russia and China, who seek a world consistent with their authoritarian model. Mattis' resignation came as a shock to officials at the Pentagon and was seen as a rebuke of Trump's unpredictable and isolationist foreign policy decisions. His departure leaves the Trump administration without a key figure who was respected by allies and adversaries alike and who provided a counterbalance to the president's impulsive decision-making. Mattis' resignation letter serves as a stark reminder of the growing tensions within the administration and the potential consequences of Trump's rejection of traditional American alliances and global leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
