SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, known for his experience and stability, viewed his responsibility to protect US troops as worth conceding to the mercurial president. However, Trump's Syria decision and rejection of allies were steps too far. Mattis' resignation letter condemned Trump's destructive approach to world power dynamics and his disregard for the competition with Russia and China. Mattis oversaw the world's most powerful military, supervising troops in war zones and deterring potential foes. Yet, his relationship with Trump deteriorated as he quietly transgressed the president's proposals. Mattis' resignation leaves a void of stability and raises concerns about the direction of US national security and alliances.
END OF SUMMARY.
