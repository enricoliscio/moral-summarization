SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but he decided that the Syria withdrawal was a step too far. In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote that he believed it was right for him to step down, as his views on treating allies with respect and being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors were not aligned with the president's. Mattis's resignation came as Congress was hurtling towards a government shutdown and a deep market slump worsened over fears of continuing government turmoil. His departure leaves policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, and marks the end of the old-guard national security team.
