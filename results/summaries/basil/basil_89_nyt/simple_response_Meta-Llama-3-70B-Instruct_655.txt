SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had been a stabilizing force in the Trump administration, but felt he could no longer serve under a president who rejects the importance of alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security. In his resignation letter, Mattis condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power, and expressed concern about abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies in Syria. Mattis's resignation is a significant blow to the Trump administration, leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton. The move has been widely criticized, with Senator Mark Warner calling Mattis "an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration."
