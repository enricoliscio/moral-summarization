SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the importance of treating allies with respect and being cleareyed about malign actors and strategic competitors. Mattis's resignation letter condemned Trump's approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power, and highlighted the importance of providing effective leadership to alliances, particularly the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mattis's core complaint was that Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want a world consistent with their authoritarian model. Mattis's resignation came as a shock, with many viewing him as an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration. His departure marks a sad day for America, as he was giving advice the President needs to hear. Mattis's resignation is a rebuke of Trump's rejection of international alliances and his decision to abandon Kurdish fighters and other American allies in Syria.
