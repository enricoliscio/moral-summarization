Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis resigning as Defense Secretary. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Mattis resigned because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and his approach to international alliances. He felt Trump's actions were harmful to U.S. interests. Mattis was known for his stability and experience, which was seen as balancing Trump's unpredictability.

The article mentions that Mattis tried to persuade Trump but was unsuccessful. His resignation was significant because he was the last of the old national security team, leaving the administration in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton. The timing was during a potential government shutdown and market downturn.

Mattis's letter criticized Trump's approach, emphasizing the importance of alliances like NATO and the coalition against ISIS. He also highlighted the threat from Russia and China. The article notes that Mattis's departure is the first major national security resignation since 1980.

Additionally, Mattis opposed Trump's other policies, like banning transgender troops, and often delayed implementing them. His departure is seen as a loss of stability in the administration.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on Mattis's resignation, his reasons, the impact, and his role in the administration.
