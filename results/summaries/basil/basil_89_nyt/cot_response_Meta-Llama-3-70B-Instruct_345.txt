SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, citing the president's rejection of international alliances as "destructive" to American influence and power. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had repeatedly told friends and aides that he viewed his responsibility to protect the US' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary to work with a "mercurial" president. However, Trump's decision to pull out of Syria was the "last straw," as it would "abandon" Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and "cede" critical territory to Russia and Iran. Mattis's resignation letter condemned Trump's approach to the world as "scary" and "chaotic," and praised the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the "Defeat ISIS" coalition. The resignation has left a "sad" and "shocked" Pentagon, and Congress is hurtling towards a government shutdown. END OF SUMMARY.
