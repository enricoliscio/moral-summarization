Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. They also provided a list of morally framed words that should be included as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Defense Secretary Mattis resigning because he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Mattis was seen as a stabilizing force in the administration, but Trump's actions, like withdrawing from Syria and his treatment of alliances, were too much for Mattis.

Next, I'll identify the key morally framed words from the list that are used in the article. Words like "balance," "withdraw," "reject," "protect," "step," "reverse," "announced," "rebuffed," "treating," "clear-eyed," "shutdown," "turmoil," "pay," "withdrawn," "ending," "chaos," "war," "plot," "kill," "underpinned," "hostages," "tragedy," "destructive," "influence," "leadership," "derided," "abandoned," "sight," "consistent," "author," "take," "pull," "withdrawal," "abandoning," "ceding," "decision," "departure," "selection," "protector," "commanded," "overseeing," "action," "deter," "working," "benefit," "torturing," "deteriorated," "treason," "oversaw," "supervising," "firing," "banning," "starting," "putting," "buried."

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating Mattis's resignation and the reasons, then mention his role as a stabilizing force. I'll include the moral implications of Trump's decisions, like withdrawing troops, rejecting alliances, and the impact on American influence. I'll also touch on Mattis's efforts to protect troops and his view on leadership and alliances. I'll make sure to keep the summary concise and within the word limit.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick to the key points: Mattis's resignation, the reasons behind it, his role in the administration, and the implications of Trump's decisions.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it meets all the user's requirements: correct starting and ending tokens, word limit, inclusion of morally framed words, and accurate representation of the article's content.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances, marking a significant blow to American leadership and stability. Mattis, seen as a stabilizing force, viewed his role as protecting U.S. troops and upholding alliances, but Trump's actions, including the Syria withdrawal, were deemed a step too far. Mattis's resignation highlights the turmoil in Trump's administration, as the president's approach to global relations was seen as destructive to U.S. influence. Mattis criticized Trump's neglect of the competition with Russia and China and the abandonment of allies, such as Kurdish fighters in Syria. His departure leaves the administration's national security in the hands of Pompeo and Bolton, amid fears of government shutdown and market instability. Mattis's letter emphasized the importance of treating allies with respect and maintaining clear-eyed leadership, reflecting his belief in the value of alliances and the need for a defense secretary whose views align with the president's. END OF SUMMARY.
