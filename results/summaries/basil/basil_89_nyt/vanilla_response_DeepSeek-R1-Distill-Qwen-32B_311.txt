Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Jim Mattis resigning. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and ends with the specified tokens. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Mattis resigning because he disagrees with Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. He felt Trump's approach was damaging to alliances and US influence. Mattis was a key figure in the administration, seen as a stabilizing force. His resignation is significant because it's the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980.

I should include the main points: Mattis's resignation, his reasons, the impact on US alliances, the reaction from Congress, and the broader implications like the shift in national security leadership.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key events and his main arguments without getting too detailed. Also, mention the withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan, and how this affects the administration's stability.

Make sure to highlight that Mattis was the last of the old national security team, leaving the role to Pompeo and Bolton. Trump's response and the significance of the resignation in context of past events, like Cyrus Vance's departure in 1980, should be included briefly.

Alright, time to put this together into a coherent summary within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mattis, a retired Marine general, viewed his role as protecting U.S. troops and maintaining alliances, but Trump's approach to global affairs was seen as destructive. Mattis's resignation came amid concerns over the withdrawal from Syria, which he believed abandoned allies and ceded territory to Russia and Iran. His departure marks the first major cabinet resignation over national security since 1980. Mattis was a stabilizing figure in the Trump administration, but his relationship with the president had deteriorated, with Trump accusing him of being a Democrat. Mattis's exit leaves national security in the hands of Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, signaling a shift in policy direction. END OF SUMMARY.
