SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and not a genuine search for truth. Despite the charges, Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The investigation is related to possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge, and a Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. The House Ethics Committee had been investigating Grimm but deferred its inquiry due to the separate Department of Justice investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
