SUMMARY: Federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm following a two-year FBI investigation. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision, claiming it was politically driven. Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents. The investigation revolves around possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions and the use of straw donors. This comes after a highly publicized incident in January where Grimm threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony for asking about the FBI investigation. The congressman has denied any knowledge of improprieties, and the FBI has not accused him of wrongdoing. Grimm's liaison to an Israeli rabbi's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a sealed criminal complaint was filed against a woman romantically involved with Grimm for using straw donors. Grimm's spokesperson did not provide an immediate comment.
END OF SUMMARY.
