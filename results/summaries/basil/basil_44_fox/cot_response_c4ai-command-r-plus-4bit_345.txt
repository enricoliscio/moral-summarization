SUMMARY:
New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision, calling it a "politically driven vendetta." Grimm maintains his innocence and believes he will be vindicated. The investigation centers around possible campaign finance violations, including allegations of illegal contributions and the use of straw donors. Despite denying any knowledge of improprieties, Grimm has been implicated by others involved in the scheme, and the FBI's investigation has uncovered inappropriate behavior. The congressman is known for his dedication and tenacity in public service, including his time as a Marine Corps veteran and FBI Special Agent. Grimm previously made headlines for threatening a reporter who questioned him about the investigation. The spokesperson for Grimm's office has yet to respond to requests for comment. END OF SUMMARY.
