SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney confirmed the charges and asserted Grimm's innocence, stating that he will be vindicated. The investigation has focused on possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions and the use of straw donors. Grimm has denied any knowledge of wrongdoing, and the FBI has not accused him of any wrongdoing. The House Ethics Committee is also investigating Grimm but has deferred its inquiry due to the Department of Justice investigation. Grimm's liaison to an Israeli rabbi's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a sealed criminal complaint was filed against a woman romantically involved with Grimm for using straw donors. Grimm's office has not commented on the charges. Grimm made headlines in January for threatening a reporter who questioned him about the investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
