SUMMARY:
Federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm, following a two-year FBI investigation. Grimm's attorney expressed disappointment at the decision, stating that Grimm is innocent of any wrongdoing and will be vindicated. The investigation centers around possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions and the use of straw donors. Grimm has denied any knowledge of improprieties, and no wrongdoing has been proven thus far. However, individuals connected to Grimm's campaign, such as Ofer Biton and a Houston woman, have pleaded guilty to related charges. The House Ethics Committee had also been investigating Grimm but deferred its inquiry due to the Department of Justice's involvement. Grimm has been vocal in his defense, infamously threatening a reporter who questioned him about the investigation. Grimm stands by his innocence and intends to continue serving his constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
