Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the article. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article mentions that Grimm's attorney confirmed federal prosecutors plan to file charges against him after a two-year FBI investigation. The attorney accuses the government of a politically motivated vendetta, which sets a moral tone against political bias. Grimm claims innocence and continues to serve his constituents.

There's also information about the House Ethics Committee investigating campaign finance violations, which they deferred due to the DOJ's investigation. The article details Grimm's confrontation with a reporter, where he threatened the reporter, showing a moral issue regarding his behavior.

Additionally, Grimm received contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, some of whom made illegal contributions via straw donors. Grimm denies knowledge of any wrongdoing, and the FBI hasn't accused him. However, an associate pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and another woman was accused of funneling illegal contributions.

I need to include all these points in a concise summary, highlighting the moral aspects like political vendetta, threat to a reporter, and questionable campaign finances. The summary should be under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure the summary: start with the charges, mention the attorney's statement, Grimm's continued service, the Ethics Committee's deferral, the confrontation, the campaign contributions, and the associates' legal issues. Make sure to convey the moral framing by emphasizing the political motive and the threat.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Let me draft it and check the word count.

An associate pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman romantically linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors to funnel illegal contributions to his campaign.
