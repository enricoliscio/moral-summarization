SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to face criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney confirmed the charges, calling it a "politically driven vendetta" and stating that Grimm asserts his innocence and will continue to serve his constituents. The investigation has been ongoing since 2012, with the House Ethics Committee announcing in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. The FBI has been looking into Grimm's fundraising activities, including a $250,000 to $300,000 contribution from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge, and a Houston woman was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's attorney claims the congressman will be vindicated.

END OF SUMMARY.
