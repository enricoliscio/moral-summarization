Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the key points while highlighting the moral aspects.

First, the article mentions that Grimm's attorney confirmed criminal charges are coming after a two-year FBI investigation. The attorney claims it's a politically motivated vendetta, which is a moral stance suggesting bias against Grimm.

Grimm's background as a Marine and FBI agent is noted, which adds to his credibility. He's accused of campaign finance violations, specifically receiving donations from a rabbi's followers, some of which were illegal. He denies any wrongdoing, emphasizing his innocence.

The FBI hasn't accused him directly, but others involved, like Ofer Biton and a woman, have pleaded guilty. This shows others are implicated but not Grimm. The article also describes Grimm confronting a reporter, which could be seen as aggressive behavior, adding another moral dimension.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll include the main points: charges, investigation, attorney's statement, Grimm's denial, campaign finance issues, others' guilty pleas, and the confrontation with the reporter.

I should structure it to show the moral framing, like the politically driven claim and Grimm's assertion of innocence despite others' guilty pleas. Also, mention the aggressive behavior to highlight his character in this context.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements concisely.

SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against him, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney accused the government of pursuing a politically motivated vendetta, asserting Grimm's innocence and promising his eventual vindication. Grimm, a Marine Corps veteran and former FBI agent, has denied any wrongdoing, despite allegations of campaign finance violations, including receiving illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. While the FBI has not accused Grimm directly, others linked to his campaign, including an Israeli businessman and a romantic partner, have pleaded guilty to immigration fraud and using straw donors for illegal contributions. Grimm has also faced scrutiny for confronting a reporter on Capitol Hill, threatening to throw him off a balcony if he continued to ask questions about the investigation. The House Ethics Committee deferred its inquiry due to the ongoing Department of Justice investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
