SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that the congressman asserts his innocence and will continue to serve his constituents with dedication. The investigation is related to possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge, and a Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's attorney claims the government is not seeking the truth, but rather pursuing a political agenda. The congressman's innocence will be vindicated, according to his attorney.
