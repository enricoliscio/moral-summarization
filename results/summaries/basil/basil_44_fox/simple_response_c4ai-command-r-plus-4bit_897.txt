SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, claims that the government's decision to pursue charges is politically motivated and denies any wrongdoing on Grimm's part. The investigation has focused on possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions and the use of straw donors. Grimm has been accused of receiving contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, with some members of the congregation admitting to making illegal donations. Despite denying knowledge of any improprieties, the congressman's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. In a separate case, a Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to funnel at least $10,000 to his campaign. Grimm's threats toward a reporter who questioned him about the investigation also raised concerns. The House Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice are investigating these matters, with Grimm's attorney asserting his innocence and vowing to continue serving his constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
