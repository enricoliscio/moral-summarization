SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney confirmed the charges, calling it a "politically driven vendetta" and asserting the congressman's innocence. The investigation has been ongoing since 2012, with the House Ethics Committee announcing in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. The charges are likely related to fundraising during Grimm's first campaign, during which he received contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Some of these contributions were allegedly made illegally through straw donors. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison to the rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge, and a woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm plans to continue serving his constituents while fighting the charges.

END OF SUMMARY.
