SUMMARY: Federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm following a two-year FBI investigation. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision, stating that Grimm asserts his innocence and will be vindicated. The investigation revolves around possible campaign finance violations, with the House Ethics Committee previously announcing an inquiry that was deferred due to the Department of Justice investigation. Grimm has been under scrutiny for his ties to an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, and his followers, with some members admitting to making illegal contributions. The congressman gained notoriety for threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony when questioned about the investigation. The FBI has not accused Grimm of any wrongdoing, but an Israeli businessman who served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a sealed criminal complaint was filed against a woman romantically involved with Grimm for using straw donors. Grimm's office has not responded to requests for comment. 

END OF SUMMARY.
