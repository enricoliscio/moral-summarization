SUMMARY:
New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm "asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing." The congressman will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication and tenacity" until the matter is resolved. The investigation surrounds possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but a Houston woman romantically involved with him was accused of funneling at least $10,000 to his campaign using straw donors. Grimm's attorney claims the government is pursuing a "vendetta" rather than an "independent search for the truth." Grimm is determined to be "vindicated" and prove his innocence. END OF SUMMARY.
