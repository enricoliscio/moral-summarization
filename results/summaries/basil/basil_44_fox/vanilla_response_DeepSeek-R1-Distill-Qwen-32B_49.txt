Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through it carefully.

The article says that Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors will file charges against him after a two-year FBI investigation. The attorney claims it's a politically motivated vendetta. Grimm maintains his innocence and continues to serve his constituents.

There's mention of a House Ethics Committee investigation into campaign finance violations, which was deferred because of the DOJ's separate probe. A reporter confrontation incident is highlighted where Grimm threatened to throw the reporter off a balcony. Grimm admitted receiving funds from followers of an Israeli rabbi, but denied knowing about any improprieties. An associate, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and another woman was accused of using straw donors to contribute illegally.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: charges, investigation, Grimm's response, the reporter incident, the funds from the rabbi, Biton's guilty plea, and the woman's accusation. I'll make sure to include that Grimm denies any wrongdoing and continues his public service.
