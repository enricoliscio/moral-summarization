SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and not an "independent search for the truth." Grimm asserts his "innocence of any wrongdoing" and vows to be "vindicated." Despite the investigation, Grimm will continue to "serve" his constituents with dedication. The House Ethics Committee has been investigating Grimm for possible campaign finance "violations." The congressman has been accused of receiving illegal campaign "contributions" from followers of an Israeli rabbi, which he denies. An Israeli businessman and a Houston woman have pleaded guilty to "fraud" and "funneling" illegal donations to Grimm's campaign. Grimm's attorney claims the government is pursuing a "vendetta" rather than seeking the "truth." The congressman's innocence will be put to the test as he faces criminal charges.

END OF SUMMARY.
