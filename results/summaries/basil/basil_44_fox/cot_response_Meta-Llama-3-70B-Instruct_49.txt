SUMMARY:
New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and not an "independent search for the truth." Grimm asserts his "innocence of any wrongdoing" and will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication" and "tenacity." The congressman has been under investigation for possible campaign finance violations, including receiving illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but his liaison to the rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge. The FBI has also accused a Houston woman of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions to Grimm's campaign. Grimm's attorney says he will be "vindicated" and continue to serve the public with a lifetime of public service. END OF SUMMARY.
