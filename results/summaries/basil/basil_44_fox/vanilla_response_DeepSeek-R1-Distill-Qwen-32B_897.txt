Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against him. The investigation has been going on for two years by the FBI, looking into his business and campaign history. His attorney says they're disappointed but not surprised, claiming it's a politically driven vendetta, not a fair investigation. Grimm maintains his innocence and says he'll be vindicated. He's continuing his public service roles.

Then, the House Ethics Committee was looking into possible campaign finance violations in November but deferred their inquiry because of the Department of Justice's separate investigation. The U.S. attorney in Brooklyn wouldn't comment on the case.

There's also a part where Grimm confronted a reporter on a Capitol balcony, threatening him after being questioned about the investigation. Grimm acknowledged receiving $250k-$300k from followers of an Israeli rabbi, but denied knowing about any wrongdoing. An Israeli businessman involved with Grimm's campaign pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A woman linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal contributions, funneling at least $10k through friends.

Grimm's office didn't respond to comments on Friday.

Okay, so the main points are:

1. Federal charges planned against Grimm after a two-year FBI investigation.
2. Attorney claims it's politically motivated, Grimm denies wrongdoing.
3. Ethics committee deferred their inquiry due to DOJ investigation.
4. Grimm's confrontation with a reporter.
5. Receipt of funds from rabbi's followers, but denies knowledge of impropriety.
6. Businessman and woman involved in illegal contributions, both facing charges.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should structure it by mentioning the charges, the investigation, Grimm's response, the Ethics Committee's action, the confrontation, the funding from the rabbi's followers, and the related charges against others.

I should make sure to include that the attorney called it a politically driven vendetta, Grimm's denial, the deferral of the Ethics Committee's inquiry, the confrontation incident, the $250k-$300k contributions, the businessman's guilty plea, and the woman's charges.

I need to be concise but cover all these points without going over 200 words. Let me try to put it all together in a coherent manner.
