SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" rather than an "independent search for the truth." Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing and vows to be vindicated. Despite the investigation, Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The House Ethics Committee had been investigating Grimm for possible campaign finance violations, but deferred its inquiry due to the separate Department of Justice investigation. The investigation surrounds Grimm's receipt of $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, with some members of the congregation admitting to making illegal contributions through straw donors. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but his liaison to the rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge.

END OF SUMMARY.
