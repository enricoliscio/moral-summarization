SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserts Grimm's innocence, stating that the congressman will be vindicated. The House Ethics Committee had previously announced an investigation into possible campaign finance violations, but deferred to the Department of Justice's separate inquiry. Grimm has been accused of receiving illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, with some members of the congregation admitting to making tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions. Grimm denies any wrongdoing, and the FBI has not accused him of any. However, a sealed criminal complaint reveals that a woman romantically involved with Grimm used straw donors to funnel illegal campaign contributions. Despite Grimm's service as a Marine Corps veteran and decorated FBI Special Agent, he now faces serious allegations of wrongdoing.
END OF SUMMARY.
