Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the article says that Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file charges against him. The investigation has been going on for two years, looking into his business and campaign history. His attorney claims the investigation is politically motivated, not independent. Grimm maintains his innocence and says he'll be vindicated. He continues to serve his constituents.

The House Ethics Committee was looking into campaign finance violations but deferred because of the Department of Justice's investigation. A U.S. attorney in Brooklyn declined to comment.

Grimm made news when he confronted a reporter on a balcony, threatening him. He received campaign contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, some of whom made illegal contributions through straw donors. Grimm denies any knowledge of wrongdoing. An associate, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to contribute illegally.

So, the key points are: charges planned, two-year FBI investigation, attorney's claims, Grimm's denial, confrontation with reporter, campaign contributions from rabbi's followers, illegal donations via straw donors, associate's guilty plea, and the woman's accusation.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the charges, mention the investigation, Grimm's response, the confrontation, the contributions and straw donors, the guilty plea, and the accusation against the woman. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against him, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney accused the government of pursuing a politically motivated vendetta and stated Grimm maintains his innocence. The House Ethics Committee had deferred its investigation into possible campaign finance violations due to a separate Department of Justice probe. Grimm gained attention in January for confronting a reporter on Capitol Hill, threatening him after questioning about the investigation. Grimm has acknowledged receiving campaign contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, though he denies knowledge of any impropriety. An associate pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman romantically linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal contributions. END OF SUMMARY.
