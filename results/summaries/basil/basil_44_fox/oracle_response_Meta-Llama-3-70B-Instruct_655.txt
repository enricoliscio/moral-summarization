SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" rather than an "independent search for the truth." Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing and vows to be vindicated. Despite the charges, Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The investigation has uncovered possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions made by followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm was also accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions, funneling at least $10,000 to his campaign. Grimm's attorney claims the government is pursuing a vendetta, but the congressman's innocence remains to be proven.

END OF SUMMARY.
