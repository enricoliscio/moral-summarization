SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and not an independent search for truth. Despite the allegations, Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication. The investigation is related to possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman and a Houston woman have pleaded guilty to related charges. The congressman's behavior has been questioned in the past, including a confrontation with a reporter who asked about the investigation. Grimm's attorney claims he will be vindicated, but the charges cast a shadow over his public service.

END OF SUMMARY.
