Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about Congressman Michael Grimm facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors after a two-year FBI investigation. His attorney claims it's a politically driven vendetta and not a search for truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and says he'll be vindicated. The investigation includes possible campaign finance violations, with contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, some of which were illegal through straw donors. Ofer Biton pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman was accused of funneling donations to Grimm's campaign.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: investigation, vendetta, truth, innocence, wrongdoing, vindicated, serve, violations, throw, contributions, made, passed, improprieties, guilty, fraud, using, funneling, passing. I should include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll structure the summary to include the charges, the investigation, the attorney's statement about vendetta, Grimm's assertion of innocence, the campaign finance violations, contributions, straw donors, the guilty plea, and the accusations of funneling and passing donations. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the moral terms.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely while preserving the moral language. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney accused the government of pursuing a politically driven vendetta rather than seeking the truth. Grimm maintains his innocence, asserting he will be vindicated and continues to serve his constituents. The House Ethics Committee had previously deferred its inquiry into potential campaign finance violations due to a separate Department of Justice investigation. Grimm was involved in a controversial incident where he threatened a reporter during an inquiry about fundraising. He acknowledged receiving contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, though he denies knowledge of any improprieties. Ofer Biton, his liaison to the rabbi's congregation, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A Houston woman romantically linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors to funnel illegal campaign contributions to his campaign. The FBI has not accused Grimm of wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
