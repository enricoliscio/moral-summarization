SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to face criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney confirmed the decision, calling it a "politically driven vendetta" and stating that Grimm asserts his innocence and will continue to serve his constituents. The investigation is related to possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison to the rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge. Additionally, a woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. The House Ethics Committee had also been investigating Grimm for possible campaign finance violations, but deferred its inquiry due to the separate Department of Justice investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
