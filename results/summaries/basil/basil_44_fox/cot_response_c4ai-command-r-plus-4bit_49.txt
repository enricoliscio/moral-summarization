SUMMARY: 
Rep. Michael Grimm is facing potential criminal charges as a result of a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney expressed disappointment in the government's decision to pursue charges, alleging a politically driven vendetta. Grimm maintains his innocence and believes he will be vindicated. 

The investigation centers around possible campaign finance violations, with Grimm denying any knowledge of wrongdoing. However, there have been allegations of illegal contributions and the use of straw donors, with some individuals already pleading guilty to related charges. Grimm was also involved in an incident where he threatened a reporter who questioned him about the investigation. 

Despite Grimm's assertions of innocence, the evidence and testimonies of others suggest potential involvement in inappropriate activities. The investigation and charges against Grimm raise concerns about corruption and inappropriate behavior by those in positions of power. The public embarrassment and potential criminal consequences serve as a reminder of the importance of upholding ethical standards and the consequences of inappropriate behavior. 

END OF SUMMARY.
