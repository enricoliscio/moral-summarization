SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, claims that the government's decision to pursue charges is politically motivated and denies any wrongdoing by Grimm, asserting his innocence. The investigation centers around possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions and the use of straw donors. Despite the allegations, Grimm maintains his dedication to serving his constituents and denies any knowledge of improprieties. The case has gained attention due to Grimm's confrontation with a reporter, where he threatened to throw the reporter off a balcony for asking about the investigation. Previous associates of Grimm have pleaded guilty to related charges, but Grimm himself has not been convicted of any wrongdoing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
