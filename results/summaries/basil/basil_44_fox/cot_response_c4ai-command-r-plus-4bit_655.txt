SUMMARY: 
Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican, is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision, claiming it was politically driven rather than an impartial search for truth. Grimm asserts his innocence and believes he will be vindicated, continuing to serve his constituents with dedication. The House Ethics Committee had previously announced an investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Grimm, but deferred to the Department of Justice's separate inquiry. The investigation gained attention in January when Grimm threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony for asking about the FBI's probe into his campaign fundraising. Grimm acknowledged receiving substantial contributions from followers of Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto but denied any knowledge of inappropriate donations. The FBI has not accused Grimm of wrongdoing. However, individuals connected to Grimm's campaign have pleaded guilty to immigration fraud and illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, was among those charged. Despite protests of innocence, the federal prosecutors' decision indicates a belief in Grimm's inappropriate behavior. Grimm's spokesperson did not provide an immediate response to the developments.
END OF SUMMARY.
