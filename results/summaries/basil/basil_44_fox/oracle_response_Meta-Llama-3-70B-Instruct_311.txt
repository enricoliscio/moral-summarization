SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" rather than an independent search for the truth. Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing and vows to be vindicated. The investigation surrounds possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as his liaison pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a Houston woman was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's attorney claims he will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity, despite the allegations. The House Ethics Committee has deferred its inquiry due to the separate Department of Justice investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
