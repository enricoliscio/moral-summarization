Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Michael Grimm facing criminal charges from the FBI after a two-year investigation. His attorney claims it's a politically driven vendetta, aiming for truth and asserting Grimm's innocence. The charges relate to campaign finance violations, including contributions from a rabbi's followers, straw donors, and illegal funneling. There's also an incident where Grimm threatened a reporter.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like investigation, vendetta, truth, innocence, wrongdoing, vindicated, serve, violations, throw, contributions, made, passed, improprieties, guilty, fraud, using, funneling, passing.

I'll start by mentioning the investigation leading to charges. Then, the attorney's claim of a vendetta and pursuit of truth. Grimm's assertion of innocence and the ongoing service. The campaign finance violations, contributions from the rabbi's followers, straw donors, and funneling. The guilty plea from the liaison and the threat incident.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll structure it to include all these elements without being too verbose. Also, I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, using words like "vendetta," "truth," "innocence," and "fraud."

Putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure each sentence includes the key moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll review to ensure clarity and that all important points are covered.

SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is set to face criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government is pursuing a politically driven vendetta rather than seeking the truth, asserting Grimm's innocence and stating he will be vindicated. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing, including knowledge of improprieties in campaign finance. The investigation involves contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, some of whom allegedly made illegal contributions through straw donors. A liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. The FBI also accused a woman romantically linked to Grimm of funneling illegal contributions through straw donors. Grimm continues to serve his constituents, maintaining his dedication to public service. A recent incident saw Grimm threaten a reporter during an inquiry about the investigation. The House Ethics Committee deferred its inquiry due to the ongoing Department of Justice investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
