SUMMARY:
New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and not an "independent search for the truth." Grimm asserts his "innocence of any wrongdoing" and will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication" and "tenacity." The investigation has been ongoing since November, when the House Ethics Committee announced it was looking into possible campaign finance violations. Grimm has been under scrutiny for his ties to an Israeli rabbi and has denied knowledge of any improprieties. The FBI has not accused him of any wrongdoing, but has filed charges against others involved in his campaign, including a Houston woman who used "straw donors" to make illegal contributions. Grimm's attorney claims he will be "vindicated" in the end. END OF SUMMARY.
