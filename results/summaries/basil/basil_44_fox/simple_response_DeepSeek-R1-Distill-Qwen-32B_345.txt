Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article mentions that Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file charges against him. The investigation has been going on for two years, looking into his business and campaign history. The attorney's statement accuses the government of a politically motivated vendetta, not an independent search for truth. They assert Grimm's innocence and say he'll be vindicated, continuing his service.

Then, the House Ethics Committee was looking into campaign finance violations, but deferred because of the DOJ investigation. A U.S. attorney couldn't comment. There's also an incident where Grimm threatened a reporter, which shows a heated exchange. Grimm received contributions from a rabbi's followers, some of whom made illegal contributions via straw donors. Grimm denies knowledge of any wrongdoing. An Israeli businessman linked to the contributions pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A woman involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to funnel money, which was recently made public.

The summary needs to capture all these points, emphasizing the moral aspects. The attorney's statement about a politically driven investigation is key. Also, Grimm's denial of wrongdoing and the ongoing investigation are important. I should mention the incident with the reporter and the details about the contributions and straw donors. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements while maintaining the moral framing from the article.

I should structure it to first state the charges, then the attorney's response, the investigation details, the Ethics Committee deferral, the reporter incident, the contributions, the guilty plea, and the recent accusation against the woman. I need to ensure it's clear and flows well without exceeding the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is included succinctly. I'll start with the charges, then the attorney's statement, followed by the investigation details, the Ethics Committee, the reporter incident, the contributions, the guilty plea, and the accusation against the woman. I'll end with Grimm's continued service despite the charges.

I should check that the summary accurately reflects the moral framing, highlighting the accusations against Grimm and his denials, as well as the political angle from his attorney. Keeping it under 200 words will require being concise but comprehensive.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring all key points are included without unnecessary details.
