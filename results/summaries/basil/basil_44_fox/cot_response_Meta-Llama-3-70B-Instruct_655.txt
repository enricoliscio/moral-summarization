SUMMARY:
New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm "asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing." The congressman will continue to serve his constituents with "dedication and tenacity" despite the allegations. The investigation involves possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman and a Houston woman have pleaded guilty to related charges. The congressman's attorney claims Grimm will be "vindicated" and that the government's pursuit is not an "independent search for the truth." END OF SUMMARY.
