Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through it carefully. The article says that Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file charges against him after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. The attorney claims it's a politically motivated vendetta. Grimm maintains his innocence and continues to serve his constituents.

The House Ethics Committee was looking into campaign finance violations, but deferred because of the DOJ investigation. There's also mention of an incident where Grimm confronted a reporter on a balcony, threatening him. Grimm received contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, some of whom made illegal contributions through straw donors. An Israeli businessman, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman involved with Grimm was accused of funneling illegal contributions.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the main points: charges planned, investigation details, attorney's statement, Ethics Committee involvement, the reporter incident, campaign contributions, Biton's guilty plea, and the woman's accusation. I'll make sure to mention Grimm's denial of wrongdoing and his ongoing service.

Let me structure it: mention the charges, the investigation, attorney's response, Ethics Committee deferring, the confrontation with the reporter, the campaign contributions, Biton's plea, the woman's case, and Grimm's denial. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I think that covers all the essential points without getting too detailed. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, called the decision politically motivated and asserted Grimm's innocence. The House Ethics Committee had deferred its inquiry into possible campaign finance violations due to a separate Department of Justice investigation. Grimm recently confronted a reporter on Capitol Hill, threatening him after being questioned about the investigation. Grimm has acknowledged receiving contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, though he denies knowledge of any wrongdoing. An Israeli businessman, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman romantically linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors to funnel illegal contributions to his campaign. Grimm continues to deny any wrongdoing and remains dedicated to his public service. END OF SUMMARY.
