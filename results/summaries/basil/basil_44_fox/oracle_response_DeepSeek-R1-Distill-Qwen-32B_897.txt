Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I have to make sure those are included in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and follow the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. His attorney claims it's a politically driven vendetta, not a search for truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents.

There's mention of campaign finance violations, specifically contributions from an Israeli rabbi's followers, some of whom made illegal contributions through straw donors. Grimm denies any wrongdoing. An associate pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and another individual was accused of funneling money through straw donors.

I need to include the moral words: investigation, vendetta, truth, innocence, wrongdoing, vindicated, serve, violations, throw, contributions, made, passed, improprieties, guilty, fraud, using, funneling, passing.

I'll structure the summary to cover the charges, the investigation, the attorney's statement, Grimm's denial, the campaign finance issues, and the associated guilty pleas. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. Grimm's attorney claims the investigation is a politically driven vendetta, asserting Grimm's innocence and his commitment to serving constituents. The House Ethics Committee had deferred its inquiry into possible campaign finance violations due to a separate Department of Justice investigation. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, though an associate pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A Houston woman was accused of funneling illegal contributions through straw donors, with at least $10,000 passed to Grimm's campaign. Grimm maintains he will be vindicated, continuing to serve with dedication. END OF SUMMARY.
