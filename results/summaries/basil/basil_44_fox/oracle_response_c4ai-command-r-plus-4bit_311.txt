SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, calls the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserts Grimm's innocence, stating that the congressman will be vindicated. The House Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice are both investigating Grimm for possible campaign finance violations. The congressman has been accused of receiving illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, with some members of the congregation admitting to making tens of thousands of dollars in illegal donations. Despite Grimm's denial of any wrongdoing, the FBI's investigation has led to guilty pleas from individuals associated with Grimm, including Ofer Biton, who pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a Houston woman who admitted to funneling illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's threats against a reporter who questioned him about the investigation have also drawn attention. The congressman's spokesman, Nick Iacono, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Grimm continues to serve his constituents while denying any wrongdoing.
END OF SUMMARY.
