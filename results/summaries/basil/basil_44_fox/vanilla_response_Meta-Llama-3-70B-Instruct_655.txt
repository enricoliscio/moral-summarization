SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence and will be vindicated. The investigation is related to possible campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but an Israeli businessman who served as Grimm's liaison pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge. Additionally, a Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's attorney stated that he will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity.

END OF SUMMARY.
