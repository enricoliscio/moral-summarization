SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to face criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney confirmed the news, calling it a "politically driven vendetta" and stating that Grimm asserts his innocence and will continue to serve his constituents. The investigation has been ongoing since 2012, with the House Ethics Committee announcing in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. The probe has focused on Grimm's fundraising during his first campaign, including contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Some of these contributions were allegedly made illegally through straw donors. Grimm has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing. The news comes after a Houston woman was accused of funneling illegal campaign contributions to Grimm's campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
