Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me go through the article again to identify the key points and the words to include.

The article is about Rep. Michael Grimm facing criminal charges. The attorney calls it a politically driven vendetta, so "vendetta" is important. The investigation has been going on for two years, so "investigation" is a key term. The attorney mentions the government's pursuit, so "truth" is involved since they say it's not an independent search for truth.

Grimm asserts his innocence, so "innocence" and "wrongdoing" are relevant. He's confident he'll be vindicated, so "vindicated" should be included. He's continuing to serve, so "serve" is another term.

The House Ethics Committee looked into campaign finance violations, so "violations" is important. The reporter incident where Grimm threatened to throw someone off a balcony uses "throw." Contributions from the rabbi's followers are mentioned, so "contributions" and "made" are relevant.

The FBI hasn't accused Grimm, but others have been involved in improprieties, so "improprieties" is a term to include. Ofer Biton pleaded guilty to fraud, so "guilty" and "fraud" are key. The woman used straw donors, so "using," "funneling," and "passing" are important.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of these terms as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the investigation, the accusations, Grimm's defense, and the related charges against others. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the political vendetta and the integrity of the investigation.

SUMMARY:  
New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm faces criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. His attorney claims the case is politically driven, calling it a "vendetta" rather than a pursuit of the truth. Grimm maintains his "innocence" and vows to be "vindicated," continuing to "serve" his constituents. The investigation stems from possible campaign finance "violations," including illegal "contributions" funneled through "straw donors." Grimm has denied any "wrongdoing" or knowledge of "improprieties," though an Israeli businessman linked to his campaign pleaded "guilty" to immigration fraud. A woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of "using" straw donors to "funnel" at least $10,000 to his campaign. The case highlights tensions between political integrity and allegations of misconduct.  
END OF SUMMARY.
