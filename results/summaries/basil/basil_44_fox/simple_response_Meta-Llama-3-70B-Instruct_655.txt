SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" and that Grimm asserts his innocence. The investigation is likely related to campaign finance violations, including illegal contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, but his liaison to the rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge, and a woman romantically involved with Grimm was accused of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's attorney claims he will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity, despite the charges. The situation raises questions about the integrity of political campaigns and the influence of special interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
