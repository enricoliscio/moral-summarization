SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, called the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and stated that Grimm asserts his innocence. The House Ethics Committee had previously announced an investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Grimm, but deferred its inquiry due to the Department of Justice investigation. Grimm has been accused of receiving illegal campaign contributions and using straw donors, but he denies any wrongdoing and believes he will be vindicated. Separately, an Israeli businessman who served as Grimm's liaison to a rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a sealed criminal complaint accused a woman romantically involved with Grimm of funneling illegal campaign contributions. Despite the serious allegations and impending charges, Grimm intends to continue serving his constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
