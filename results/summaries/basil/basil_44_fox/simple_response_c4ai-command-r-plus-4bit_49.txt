SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, claims that the investigation is politically motivated and denies any wrongdoing on Grimm's part, stating that the congressman will be vindicated. The House Ethics Committee had previously announced an investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Grimm, but deferred to the Department of Justice's separate investigation. Grimm has been under scrutiny for his association with an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, and his followers, some of whom have admitted to making illegal campaign contributions. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI has not accused him of wrongdoing. However, a sealed criminal complaint filed in August accused a woman romantically involved with Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's threats to throw a reporter off a balcony for questioning him about the investigation have also drawn attention. His attorney emphasizes Grimm's dedication and public service as a congressman, Marine Corps veteran, and FBI Special Agent.

END OF SUMMARY.
