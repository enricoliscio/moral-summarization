SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision, claiming it was politically motivated. Grimm asserts his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents. The House Ethics Committee had previously announced an investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Grimm, but deferred to the Department of Justice investigation. Grimm has been under scrutiny for his ties to an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, and his followers, with some members admitting to making illegal contributions to Grimm's campaign. A Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm also recently pleaded guilty to using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing, and the FBI has not accused him of any wrongdoing. Grimm's spokesperson did not immediately provide a comment.
END OF SUMMARY.
