SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors following a two-year FBI investigation. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, stated that Grimm asserts his innocence and will be vindicated. The investigation revolves around possible campaign finance violations, with the House Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice both conducting inquiries. Grimm has been accused of receiving illegal campaign contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, and denying knowledge of any wrongdoing. A separate case also involves a Houston woman who was romantically involved with Grimm and is accused of funneling illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's attorney expressed disappointment in the government's decision to pursue charges, calling it a "politically driven vendetta." Grimm, a Marine Corps veteran and former FBI Special Agent, plans to continue serving his constituents. The spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn declined to comment on the case.
END OF SUMMARY.
