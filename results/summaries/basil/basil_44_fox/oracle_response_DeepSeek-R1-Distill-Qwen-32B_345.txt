Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the task. The user provided a detailed article about Rep. Michael Grimm and the charges against him. They also listed specific morally framed words that should be included in the summary. My job is to create a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article to grasp the main points. It's about Grimm facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors after an FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. His attorney claims it's a politically motivated vendetta, not a search for truth. Grimm maintains his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents. There's mention of campaign finance violations, straw donors, and illegal contributions. A liaison pleaded guilty to fraud, and a woman was accused of funneling money through straw donors.

Now, I need to extract the key elements while using the specified moral words: investigation, vendetta, truth, innocence, wrongdoing, vindicated, serve, violations, throw, contributions, made, passed, improprieties, guilty, fraud, using, funneling, passing.

I should start by stating that Grimm's attorney confirmed the charges, following an investigation. Highlight the attorney's claim of a vendetta, not a truth-seeking investigation. Mention Grimm's assertion of innocence and his intention to be vindicated while continuing to serve. Include the campaign finance violations, contributions from Pinto's followers, and the use of straw donors. Note the guilty plea and the accusation of funneling contributions.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include all the moral words without making it sound forced. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and includes the necessary terms.

Wait, I should also mention the incident where Grimm threatened a reporter, as that adds context to his behavior and the ongoing scrutiny. That incident involved him throwing a threat, so that's another moral word to include.

Putting it all together, I'll start with the confirmation of charges, the investigation, the vendetta claim, Grimm's innocence and service, the violations, contributions, straw donors, the guilty plea, and the funneling accusation. Make sure each sentence includes the required terms smoothly.

I think that covers all the points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally while incorporating all the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against him, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. The attorney accused the government of pursuing a politically motivated vendetta rather than seeking the truth, while Grimm maintains his innocence and vows to be vindicated. He continues to serve his constituents despite the allegations. Grimm has been under investigation for potential campaign finance violations, including receiving contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, some of whom admitted to illegal contributions through straw donors. Grimm denies any wrongdoing, and the FBI has not accused him of improprieties. A liaison to the rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman romantically linked to Grimm was accused of funneling illegal contributions through straw donors. The case highlights concerns about campaign finance violations and the use of improper methods to secure donations. END OF SUMMARY.
