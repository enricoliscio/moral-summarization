SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, claims that the investigation is politically motivated and that Grimm is innocent of any wrongdoing. The House Ethics Committee has also been investigating Grimm for possible campaign finance violations but deferred its inquiry due to the Department of Justice investigation. Grimm has been accused of receiving illegal campaign contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, and denying knowledge of any improprieties. The FBI has not accused Grimm of wrongdoing, but a sealed criminal complaint revealed that a Houston woman romantically involved with Grimm used straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's threats toward a reporter who questioned him about the investigation in January have also raised concerns. Despite the allegations, Grimm asserts his innocence and plans to continue serving his constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
