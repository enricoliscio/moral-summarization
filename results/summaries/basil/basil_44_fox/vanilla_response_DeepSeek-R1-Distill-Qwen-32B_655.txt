Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. Let me read through it carefully.

The article mentions that Grimm's attorney confirmed federal prosecutors plan to file charges against him after a two-year FBI investigation. The investigation covers his business and campaign history. The attorney says the government is pursuing a politically motivated vendetta, not an independent search for truth. Grimm claims innocence and will continue serving his constituents.

Also, the House Ethics Committee was investigating possible campaign finance violations but deferred because of the DOJ probe. A reporter was confronted by Grimm on a balcony, which made headlines. Grimm acknowledged receiving funds from an Israeli rabbi's followers, but denies knowing about any improprieties. An Israeli businessman, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a woman linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors for campaign contributions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: charges planned, two-year investigation, attorney's statement, Grimm's denial, confrontation with reporter, campaign finance issues, Biton's plea, and the woman's accusation.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the charges, then the investigation details, Grimm's response, the ethics committee, the confrontation, and the related cases. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without going into too much detail. Also, end with the required tokens.
