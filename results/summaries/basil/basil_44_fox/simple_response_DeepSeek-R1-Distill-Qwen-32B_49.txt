Alright, so the user has given me a news article about Rep. Michael Grimm and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. Hmm, okay. I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without losing the moral perspective the author presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Grimm facing criminal charges from the FBI after a two-year investigation. His attorney claims it's a politically motivated vendetta, which is a strong moral statement. I should highlight that to show the framing.

Grimm's attorney says he's innocent and will be vindicated. That's important for the moral angle, emphasizing his innocence despite the investigation. Also, the article mentions the House Ethics Committee's involvement and a reporter confrontation, which adds context about the political and personal pressures Grimm is under.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key events: the charges, the investigation, Grimm's denial, the attorney's statement, the Ethics Committee's deferral, the reporter incident, and the illegal contributions via straw donors. I should also mention the guilty plea and the sealed complaint to show the broader context of the case.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details like the specific amounts or names unless they're crucial. The main goal is to convey that Grimm is under investigation for possible wrongdoing, but he and his team are framing it as a politically driven attack. That moral framing is essential, so I'll make sure to include his assertion of innocence and the attorney's criticism of the government's motives.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to start with the charges, then the investigation details, Grimm's response, the Ethics Committee, the reporter incident, the contributions, and the legal actions against others. Ending with Grimm's continued service ties it back to his dedication despite the allegations.

Let me make sure I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the facts while keeping the moral elements intact. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against him, following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney accused the government of pursuing a politically motivated vendetta rather than an independent inquiry. Grimm maintains his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents. The House Ethics Committee had deferred its investigation into potential campaign finance violations due to a separate Department of Justice probe. Grimm previously confronted a reporter on Capitol Hill, threatening to throw him off a balcony after being questioned about the investigation. Grimm has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing, though an Israeli businessman who acted as his liaison to a rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. The FBI has also filed a sealed complaint against a woman romantically linked to Grimm, accusing her of using straw donors to funnel illegal campaign contributions. Grimm's office did not respond to requests for comment. END OF SUMMARY.
