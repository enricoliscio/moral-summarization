SUMMARY:

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney claims the government's decision is a "politically driven vendetta" rather than an "independent search for the truth." Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing and vows to be vindicated. Despite the charges, Grimm will continue to serve his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The investigation has been ongoing since November, when the House Ethics Committee announced it was looking into possible campaign finance violations. Grimm has been accused of receiving illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors, but has denied knowledge of any improprieties. Others involved in the case, including an Israeli businessman and a Houston woman, have pleaded guilty to fraud and immigration charges. Grimm's attorney claims the government's pursuit of the congressman is unfair and motivated by politics rather than a search for truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
