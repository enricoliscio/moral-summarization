SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is facing criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign history. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, called the investigation a "politically driven vendetta" and asserted Grimm's innocence, stating that the government is not independently searching for the truth. The House Ethics Committee is also investigating Grimm for possible campaign finance violations, specifically regarding illegal contributions and funneling of funds through straw donors. Grimm has denied any wrongdoing and claims he will be vindicated. Separately, Grimm made headlines for threatening a reporter who questioned him about the FBI investigation. The congressman's liaison to an Israeli rabbi's followers pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, and a sealed criminal complaint was filed against a woman romantically involved with Grimm for using straw donors. Grimm's spokesman did not comment on the charges.
END OF SUMMARY.
