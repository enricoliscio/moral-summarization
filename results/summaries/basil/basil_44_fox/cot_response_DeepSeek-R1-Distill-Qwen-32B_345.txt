Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want a news summary that includes the morally charged words from the original text. 

Looking at the article, it's about Congressman Michael Grimm facing criminal charges. The attorney's statement talks about a politically driven vendetta, which is a strong moral term. I need to make sure to include that. Also, words like "disappointed," "innocence," "vindicated," and "dedication" are part of the moral framing.

I should go through the article step by step. The first part is about the charges and the investigation. The attorney's statement is crucial because it accuses the government of bias, which is a moral charge. Then, the article mentions the Ethics Committee and the reporter incident, where Grimm threatens the reporter. That's another moral point about conduct and behavior.

Grimm's connections to the rabbi's followers and the illegal contributions are central. The use of straw donors and the plea deals are part of the moral narrative, showing possible wrongdoing. I need to highlight Grimm's denial of knowledge and the lack of direct accusations against him, but also the sealed complaint against the woman involved.

Finally, I should structure the summary to include all these elements, making sure each morally framed word is present. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and flow naturally while keeping the moral context intact.

I should start by identifying the key points: charges, investigation, attorney's statement, Ethics Committee, reporter incident, contributions, straw donors, plea deals, and the sealed complaint. Each of these points has moral implications, so I'll make sure to weave them into the summary without making it too long.

Also, I need to ensure that the summary doesn't just list facts but also reflects the moral tone, like the vendetta accusation and Grimm's dedication despite the charges. I'll make sure each sentence contributes to the overall moral framing without adding unnecessary details.

Alright, I think I have a clear path. I'll start by outlining the main events, then incorporate the moral terms as I go. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm faces criminal charges after a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. Grimm's attorney claims the charges are part of a "politically driven vendetta" and accuses the government of bias. Grimm maintains his innocence and vows to continue serving his constituents with dedication and tenacity. The House Ethics Committee had previously deferred its inquiry into possible campaign finance violations due to a Department of Justice investigation. Grimm was involved in a controversial incident where he threatened a reporter on Capitol Hill. The FBI investigation revealed illegal campaign contributions, including funds from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, funneled through straw donors. Grimm denies knowledge of any wrongdoing, though his liaison, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A sealed criminal complaint accused a woman romantically linked to Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal contributions. Grimm's office did not respond to requests for comment.
