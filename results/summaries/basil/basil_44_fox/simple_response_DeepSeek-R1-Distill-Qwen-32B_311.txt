Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michael Grimm. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the article. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the key points: Grimm is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors after a two-year FBI investigation. His attorney says it's a politically driven vendetta. Grimm claims innocence and continues serving. There's a mention of the House Ethics Committee and a separate investigation. Then, the incident with the reporter where Grimm threatened to throw him off a balcony. Also, campaign finance issues involving contributions from an Israeli rabbi's followers, straw donors, and a liaison who pleaded guilty to immigration fraud.

I need to include all these elements but keep it under 200 words. I should maintain the moral framing, which seems to suggest that the investigation is politically motivated and that Grimm is innocent. I'll structure the summary to highlight the charges, the attorney's response, the investigation details, the reporter incident, and the campaign finance issues.

Let me start by stating the charges and the investigation. Then mention the attorney's statement about it being a vendetta. Include Grimm's assertion of innocence and his continued service. Then touch on the Ethics Committee and the reporter incident. Finally, explain the campaign finance issues, straw donors, and the guilty plea.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go. Okay, that should cover all the main points while keeping the moral perspective intact.

SUMMARY: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is set to face criminal charges following a two-year FBI investigation into his business and campaign activities. Grimm's attorney accused the government of pursuing a politically motivated vendetta, asserting Grimm's innocence and vowing his eventual vindication. Grimm continues to serve his constituents, emphasizing his dedication to public service. The House Ethics Committee had previously deferred its investigation into potential campaign finance violations due to a separate Department of Justice probe. Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a reporter on Capitol grounds, threatening to throw him off a balcony. The investigation involves allegations of illegal campaign contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, with some donors using straw donors to funnel funds. Grimm denies knowledge of any wrongdoing, though a liaison, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to immigration fraud. A Houston woman romantically linked to Grimm was accused of using straw donors to contribute illegally to his campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
