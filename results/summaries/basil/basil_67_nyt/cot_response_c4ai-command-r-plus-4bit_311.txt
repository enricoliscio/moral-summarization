SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and urging Mexicans to reject it. Fox has been an outspoken critic of Trump's divisive rhetoric towards Mexico and his proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. He believes Trump is untrustworthy and disrespectful towards Mexicans, and has urged Americans not to vote for him. Fox expressed disbelief at the invitation extended to Trump by current Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting it was a desperate move by Trump to boost his sagging poll numbers. Trump's promises to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it have been vehemently opposed by Fox, who sees them as cynical and demeaning. In response to Fox's criticism, Trump has tried to defend himself by twisting Fox's previous statements. Fox fired back, demanding respect and reminding Trump that he had invited him to apologize to Mexicans for his offensive remarks. Fox's stance underscores the moral indignation felt by many Mexicans towards Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and policies targeting their country.
