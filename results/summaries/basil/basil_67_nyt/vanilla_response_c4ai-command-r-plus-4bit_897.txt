SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly denounced Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and stating that Trump is not welcome in the country. Fox has been critical of Trump's proposed border wall and his negative rhetoric towards Mexicans, stating that Trump cannot be trusted and should not be granted confidence or support. Trump, in turn, responded to Fox's attacks by pointing out that Fox had previously suggested he visit Mexico. Fox countered by reminding Trump that he had invited him to apologize to Mexicans, and told him to show respect to Mexico. Fox also expressed disbelief that current Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump, suggesting it was a desperate move to boost Trump's poll numbers. Fox ended by stating his opposition to the idea of Trump as US president, citing his lack of qualifications and ability to run a nation or business.
