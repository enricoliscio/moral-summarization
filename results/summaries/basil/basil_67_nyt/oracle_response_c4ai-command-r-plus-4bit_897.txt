SUMMARY: Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, despite strong objections from former Mexican leader Vicente Fox. Mr. Fox characterized the invitation as a mistake, arguing that Mr. Trump has demonized Mexicans and should not be trusted or welcomed in the country. He rejected Mr. Trump's changing and misleading plans for a border wall and the deportation of undocumented immigrants, stating that Mr. Trump disregards both Mexicans and his own people. Mr. Fox also expressed disbelief at Mr. Trump's invitation, suggesting it was a desperate move, and urged Americans not to vote for a man unfit to lead a nation or a business. Mr. Trump's response to Mr. Fox's attacks was a reminder that the former Mexican leader had once invited him to visit Mexico, to which Mr. Fox fired back that he had only invited Mr. Trump to apologize to Mexicans. Mr. Fox ended his statement with a strong rebuke, demanding respect for his country.
