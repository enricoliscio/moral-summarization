Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral terms involved.

The article is about Donald Trump visiting Mexico, where former President Vicente Fox criticizes him. Fox calls the invitation a mistake and says Trump isn't welcome because he demonized Mexicans. He mentions Trump's wall plan and his changing stance on deportations. Fox also accuses Trump of being untrustworthy, a false prophet, and misleading. Trump responds on Twitter, and Fox fires back, telling him to stop lying and show respect.

The author used specific moral words like invitation, mistake, demonized, undocumented, change, disregard, false, misleading, nation, lying, play. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should start by stating Trump's visit, Fox's criticism, and the moral terms. Then, mention Fox's points about the wall, deportations, and Trump's untrustworthiness. Include Trump's response and Fox's rebuttal. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: Trump is visiting Mexico, Fox says it's a mistake and Trump isn't welcome. Fox criticizes Trump for demonizing Mexicans, the wall, and deportations. He calls Trump untrustworthy, false, misleading, and a liar. Trump responds, and Fox tells him to stop lying and respect Mexico.

I need to make sure to include all the moral words without making the summary too long. Let me draft it and check the word count.
