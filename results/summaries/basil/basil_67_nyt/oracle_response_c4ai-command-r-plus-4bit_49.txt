SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly criticized the invitation of Donald Trump to Mexico, calling it a mistake and expressing disbelief at the decision. Fox has been an outspoken opponent of Trump's border wall proposal and his demonization of the Mexican people. He rejects the idea that Mexico will pay for the wall and believes Trump is a false and misleading leader who cannot be trusted. Fox also emphasizes that Trump's shifting policies and disregard for Mexicans and his own people make him unfit to lead a nation. Trump's visit to Mexico is seen as a desperate attempt to boost his poll numbers, and Fox urges Americans to reject him. Fox's stance highlights the moral implications of Trump's campaign promises and their potential impact on international relations.
