SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly criticized Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, saying he is not welcome in the country. Fox called Trump's invitation from current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto a "mistake" and expressed distrust of Trump's changing policies. He specifically criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Fox also urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he is unfit to be president. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had previously invited him to apologize to the Mexican people. The exchange highlights the tension between Trump and Mexico over his controversial immigration policies.
