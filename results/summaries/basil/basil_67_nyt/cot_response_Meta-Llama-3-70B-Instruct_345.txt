SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and "cynically" changing his plans on deporting undocumented immigrants. Fox expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump, suggesting it was a "desperate" attempt to boost Trump's sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he "doesn't know how to run a nation" or "even a business." Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, telling Trump to "stop lying" and show some "respect" to Mexico. Fox's strong words reflect his outrage over Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies. END OF SUMMARY.
