SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed the invitation extended to Donald Trump by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, calling it a "mistake" and stating that Trump is "not welcome" in Mexico. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and his plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying he cannot be trusted due to his constant "changes" in plans and "disregard" for people. Fox also labeled Trump a "false prophet" who is "misleading" his followers. The former president expressed disbelief that Trump was invited for a private meeting, suggesting it was a "desperate" attempt to boost his sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he doesn't know how to "run a nation" or even a business. In a Twitter exchange, Fox told Trump to "stop lying" and show some respect, reminding him that he was invited to apologize to all Mexicans, not to "play" with the country.
