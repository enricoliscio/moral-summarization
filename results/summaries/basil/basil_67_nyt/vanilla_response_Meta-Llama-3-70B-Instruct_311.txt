SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his negative comments about Mexicans. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, saying that Trump's ideas change daily and that he cannot be trusted. Fox also urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he is unfit to be president. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had invited him to apologize to all Mexicans. Fox has been a vocal critic of Trump's policies, calling him a "false prophet" and vowing that Mexico will never pay for a border wall.
