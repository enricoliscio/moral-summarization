SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that he is not welcome in the country due to his demonization of Mexicans. Fox, who served as president from 2000 to 2006, expressed disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, calling it a mistake. He accused Trump of cynically disregarding both his own people and Mexicans with his controversial policies, such as his plan to build a wall along the border and his ever-changing stance on deporting undocumented immigrants. Fox also rejected Trump's claim that Mexico would pay for the wall, vowing that it would never happen. As Trump traveled to Mexico, Fox urged Americans not to support him, stating that he is untrustworthy and lacks the qualifications to lead a nation or even a business. In response to Trump's defense of his visit, Fox reminded him of his invitation to apologize to Mexicans and demanded respect for Mexico. Fox's stance highlights the moral concerns surrounding Trump's campaign and his controversial statements about Mexico and immigration.
