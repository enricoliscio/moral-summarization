SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly rejected Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump's plans to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, saying that Trump cannot be trusted due to his constantly changing ideas. Fox also expressed disbelief that current Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump for a private meeting, suggesting that Trump's visit is a "desperate" attempt to improve his sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he doesn't know how to run a nation or a business. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had previously invited him to apologize to all Mexicans.
