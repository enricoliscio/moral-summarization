SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and stating that Trump is not welcome in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and said that Trump's plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border is a "cynical" attempt to win votes. Fox also rejected Trump's promise to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling it a "desperate" move to improve his poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he "doesn't know how to run a nation" and is a "false prophet" who is "misleading" his followers. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, telling Trump to "stop lying" and show some "respect" for Mexico. END OF SUMMARY.
