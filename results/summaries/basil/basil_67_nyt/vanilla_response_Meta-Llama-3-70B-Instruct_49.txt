SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has expressed strong opposition to Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is not welcome in the country. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and his intention to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Fox also questioned Trump's trustworthiness, citing his tendency to change his plans and ideas frequently. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he is unfit to be president. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had previously invited him to apologize to Mexicans. The current Mexican President, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, has invited Trump to meet with him, but Fox believes this was a mistake.
