SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country due to his derogatory remarks about Mexicans. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling him untrustworthy and cynical. Fox also questioned Trump's ability to lead a nation, saying he doesn't even know how to run a business. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, expressing disbelief that Trump was invited to meet with current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had invited him to apologize to Mexicans, not to exploit the country for political gain.
