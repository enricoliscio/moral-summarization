SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling the invitation a "mistake" and stating that Trump is not welcome in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and for his plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, which he vowed Mexico would never pay for. Fox also expressed disbelief that Trump was invited, suggesting it was a "desperate" attempt to improve his poll numbers. He urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he doesn't know how to "run a nation" or even a business. Fox accused Trump of being a "false prophet" who is "misleading" his followers and of "disregarding" both Americans and Mexicans. When Trump responded to Fox's attacks, Fox fired back, telling Trump to "stop lying" and show some respect, as Mexico is not his to "play with". Fox's strong words reflect his moral outrage at Trump's actions and rhetoric.
