SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly denounced Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, stating that he is not welcome in the country due to his derogatory remarks towards Mexicans and his plan to build a border wall. Fox expressed disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting that Trump's visit is a desperate attempt to boost his poll numbers.
