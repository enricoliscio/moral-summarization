SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly criticized Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, stating that he is not welcome in the country due to his negative rhetoric towards Mexicans and his proposed border wall. Fox, who served as Mexico's president from 2000 to 2006, has been a vocal opponent of Trump's policies and has repeatedly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall. He expressed disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting that Trump's visit is a desperate attempt to boost his poll numbers. In response to Fox's criticism, Trump pointed out that Fox had previously suggested he visit Mexico, to which Fox countered that he had invited Trump to apologize to Mexicans. Fox concluded by urging Americans not to vote for Trump, stating that he is unfit to lead a nation or a business.
