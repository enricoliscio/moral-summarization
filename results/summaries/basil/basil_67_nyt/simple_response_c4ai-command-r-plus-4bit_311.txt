SUMMARY: Former Mexican president Vicente Fox has strongly criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and asserting that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his demonization of the Mexican people and his inconsistent and untrustworthy policy ideas. Fox, who has previously denounced Trump's proposals for a border wall and mass deportations, expressed disbelief at the invitation extended by current Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. He characterized Trump's visit as a desperate attempt to boost his poll numbers and urged Americans not to support him. In response to Trump's defense of his visit, Fox asserted that Trump should use the opportunity to apologize to Mexicans, emphasizing the need for respect.
