Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Donald Trump visiting Mexico, and Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president, criticizing him. Fox says Trump isn't welcome because of his negative comments about Mexicans and his wall plan. He also criticizes Trump's changing policies and calls him untrustworthy. Trump responds by pointing out that Fox once invited him, but Fox says Trump should apologize.

Now, I need to capture the moral elements. Fox is emphasizing respect, trust, and the negative impact of Trump's rhetoric on Mexicans. He's also highlighting the importance of consistency in policy and leadership. Trump's side is about defending his position and dismissing Fox's criticism.

I should make sure the summary includes Fox's strong stance against Trump, the reasons he gives, and Trump's response. Also, the moral framing is about integrity, respect, and the consequences of Trump's actions on international relations and immigration.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include Fox's main criticisms and Trump's response, while maintaining the moral perspective of respect and trust.

Alright, I think I have a good grasp. Time to put it all together concisely.
