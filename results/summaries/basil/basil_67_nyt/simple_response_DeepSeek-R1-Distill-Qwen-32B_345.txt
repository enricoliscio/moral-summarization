Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the reactions from Vicente Fox. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by mentioning Trump's visit to Mexico, meeting with President Pe単a Nieto. Then it introduces Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president, who criticizes Trump. Fox says Trump isn't welcome and that Pe単a Nieto's invitation was a mistake. He mentions Trump's negative rhetoric towards Mexicans, the wall plan, and Trump's changing immigration policies. Fox distrusts Trump and calls him a "false prophet." He also believes Trump's visit is a political move to boost his polls and urges Americans not to vote for him. Trump responds by pointing out Fox suggested he visit before, and Fox counters by saying Trump should apologize and show respect.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The author seems critical of Trump, highlighting Fox's disapproval and the reasons behind it. Fox's points are about Trump's untrustworthiness, divisiveness, and disrespect towards Mexico. I should include these elements to maintain the moral perspective.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's visit and Fox's strong opposition. Then, outline Fox's reasons: demonization of Mexicans, the wall, distrust in Trump's changing policies, and the political strategy angle. Finally, include Trump's response and Fox's counter. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

Let me check for any important details I might have missed. Fox's disbelief at Pe単a Nieto's invitation, his urging Americans not to vote for Trump, and the Twitter exchange. Also, Fox's belief that Mexico won't pay for the wall and his doubts about Trump's leadership abilities.

I think that's all covered. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and maintains the moral tone against Trump.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump is set to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe単a Nieto, but former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned the visit, calling it a mistake and stating Trump is "not welcome" in Mexico. Fox criticized Trump for demonizing Mexicans, his border wall plan, and his ever-changing immigration policies, which he described as untrustworthy. Fox accused Trump of being a "false prophet" and a poor leader, unfit to govern or even run a business. He also dismissed Trump's claims that Mexico would pay for the wall, asserting it would never happen. Fox suggested Trump's visit is a desperate attempt to boost his failing poll numbers and urged Americans not to vote for him. Trump responded by pointing out Fox had previously invited him to visit Mexico, to which Fox retorted, demanding Trump apologize to Mexicans and show respect.  

END OF SUMMARY.
