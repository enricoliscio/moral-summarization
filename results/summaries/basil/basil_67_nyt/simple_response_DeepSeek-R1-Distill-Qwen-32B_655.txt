Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the query again. The user is asking for a summary of a news article about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and Vicente Fox's criticism. They want the summary to include the moral perspective the author presented.

First, I should understand the article. It talks about Trump meeting with Mexico's president, but Fox, a former president, is against this visit. Fox criticizes Trump for his anti-Mexican statements, the wall plan, and changing policies. He believes Trump shouldn't be trusted and isn't welcome. Fox also doubts Trump's business and leadership abilities. Trump responds by pointing out Fox's past invitation, but Fox insists Trump should apologize.

Now, the moral framing here is Fox's disapproval of Trump's policies and character, emphasizing the negative impact on Mexicans and the untrustworthiness of Trump. I need to make sure the summary captures Fox's strong moral stance against Trump.

I should start by stating Fox's rejection of Trump's visit. Then mention his reasons: demonizing Mexicans, the wall, and unreliable policies. Highlight Fox's disbelief in Trump's leadership and his call for Americans not to vote for him. Also, include the exchange on Twitter, showing the conflict.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: Fox's rejection, reasons, disbelief in Trump's abilities, call to action, and the Twitter exchange. Make sure each point is clear and the moral aspect is prominent.

I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all key points with the moral elements intact.

SUMMARY:  
Vicente Fox, Mexico's former president, has strongly criticized Donald Trump, calling his visit to Mexico a mistake and stating, "He is not welcome here." Fox condemned Trump for demonizing Mexicans, his border wall plan, and his shifting immigration policies, which he described as untrustworthy. Fox accused Trump of cynically disregarding both his own people and Mexicans, and he dismissed Trump's claim that Mexico would pay for the wall, vowing it would never happen. Fox also criticized Trump's leadership abilities, doubting his capacity to run a nation or even a business. He urged Americans not to vote for Trump, questioning his eligibility to sit in the presidency. Trump responded by referencing Fox's past invitation to visit Mexico, but Fox fired back, insisting Trump should apologize to Mexicans and showing respect. The exchange highlights Fox's moral opposition to Trump's policies and character.  
END OF SUMMARY.
