Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. That means I need to look for words that carry a strong moral or ethical connotation. Words like "demonized," "rejected," "false prophet," etc., might be candidates. I should list each of these words, each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and should reflect the original moral tone set by the author.

Looking at the article, Vicente Fox is strongly criticizing Trump, using terms like "not welcome," "demonized," "false prophet," and "disregard." These are key points to include. I should also mention Trump's plans, like the wall and deportations, and Fox's disbelief in Trump's intentions.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and captures the essence of Fox's disapproval and Trump's response. I'll also include Trump's tweet about Fox inviting him, which adds to the conflict.

Now, I'll start by listing the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again to catch all of them. Words like "demonized," "rejected," "false prophet," "disregard," "deport," "cynically," "desperate," "lying," "respect" all carry strong moral connotations.

For the summary, I'll structure it to first mention Fox's rejection of Trump's visit, his criticism of Trump's policies, and his disbelief in Trump's intentions. Then, I'll include Trump's response and Fox's counter. I'll keep each sentence tight to stay within the word limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together.

**SUMMARY:**  
Vicente Fox, Mexico’s former president, strongly criticized Donald Trump, calling his visit to Mexico a mistake and stating, “He is not welcome here.” Fox condemned Trump for demonizing Mexicans and his inconsistent policies, such as building a border wall and deporting undocumented immigrants. He accused Trump of being a “false prophet” and warned against trusting him, emphasizing that Mexico would never pay for the wall. Fox also criticized Trump’s campaign as desperate, aimed at improving his sagging poll numbers, and urged Americans not to vote for him. Trump responded by referencing Fox’s past invitation for him to visit Mexico, but Fox fired back, demanding Trump apologize and show respect. The exchange highlights the deep divide over Trump’s immigration policies and his leadership credibility.
