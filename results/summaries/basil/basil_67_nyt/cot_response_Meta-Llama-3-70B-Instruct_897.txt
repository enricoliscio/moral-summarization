SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and vowed that Mexico would never pay for the border wall. He also accused Trump of being a "false prophet" who "cynically" changes his plans and "disregards" his own people and Mexicans. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he "doesn't know how to run a nation" and "doesn't even know how to run a business." Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, telling Trump to "stop lying" and show some "respect" for Mexico. Fox's strong words reflect his deep-seated disapproval of Trump's actions and rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
