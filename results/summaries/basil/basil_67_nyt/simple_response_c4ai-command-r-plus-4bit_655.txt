SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and arguing that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his hateful rhetoric towards Mexicans. Fox, who has been a vocal critic of Trump's border wall proposal and deportation plans, emphasized that Trump cannot be trusted due to his inconsistent and cynical policies. He urged Americans to reject Trump's candidacy, stating that he is unfit to lead a nation. In response to Trump's claims that Mexico will pay for the wall, Fox reaffirmed his stance that Mexico will never agree to such a proposal.
