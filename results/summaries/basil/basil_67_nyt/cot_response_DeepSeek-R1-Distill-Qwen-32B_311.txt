Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump meeting with the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, and the reactions from Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. Trump is going to Mexico, and Fox is criticizing him. Fox says Trump isn't welcome, calls him untrustworthy, and criticizes his policies like the border wall and deportations. He also doubts Trump's ability to run a country or business and urges Americans not to vote for him. Trump responds by pointing out Fox once invited him to visit, but Fox says Trump should apologize.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral framing. These are words that express approval or disapproval, like "welcome," "trust," "demonized," "reject," "cynically," "disregard," "false prophet," "deceive," "desperate," "lying," "play," "respect."

Next, I'll write the summary. I need to include as many of these moral words as possible. I'll start by stating Trump is visiting Mexico, mention Fox's criticism, his reasons, and the mutual accusations on Twitter. I'll make sure to use the moral words to convey the tone.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points: Fox's rejection, the reasons, Trump's response, and the underlying issues like the wall and deportations. I'll also note Fox's disbelief in Trump's leadership abilities.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to ensure each moral word is included without making the summary too long. Maybe combine some sentences to fit all points without exceeding the limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the summary with the identified moral words included.
