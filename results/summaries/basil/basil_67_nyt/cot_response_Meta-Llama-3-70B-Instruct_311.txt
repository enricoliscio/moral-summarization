SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a "mistake" and stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and "cynically" disregarding his own people. He also rejected Trump's plan to build a border wall, saying Mexico would never pay for it. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, calling him a "false prophet" who is "misleading" his followers. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, telling Trump to "stop lying" and show some "respect" for Mexico. Fox emphasized that Trump "doesn't know how to run a nation" and "doesn't even know how to run a business." END OF SUMMARY.
