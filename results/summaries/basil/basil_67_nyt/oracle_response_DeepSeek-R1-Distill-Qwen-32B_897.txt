Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the criticism from Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president. Fox is against Trump's visit, calling it a mistake and saying Trump demonizes Mexicans. He also criticizes Trump's policies on the wall and deportations, and questions Trump's trustworthiness. Trump responds on Twitter, leading to a public exchange.

I need to make sure I include words like invitation, mistake, demonized, undocumented, change, disregard, false, misleading, nation, lying, play. I should structure the summary to highlight Fox's disapproval and the moral issues he points out. Also, mention Trump's response and the underlying themes of trust and respect.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's visit and Fox's rejection. Then mention Fox's criticism of Trump's policies and character. Include Trump's response and the clash between them. Finally, note the implications of their conflict on trust and respect.

Let me draft this, making sure to use the morally charged words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within limits. Also, I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the article's moral framing.
