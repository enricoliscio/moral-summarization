SUMMARY: Vicente Fox, former president of Mexico, has publicly expressed his disapproval of Donald Trump's invitation to meet with current Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. Fox believes that Trump, who has a history of demonizing the Mexican people and promising to build a wall along the border, is unworthy of the invitation and should not be trusted. He emphasizes that Trump's ideas are inconsistent and show disregard for both the Mexican and American people. Fox also rejects Trump's claims that Mexico will pay for the border wall, calling him a "false prophet" who is misleading his followers. In response to Trump's visit, Fox urges Americans to refrain from voting for him, stating that Trump is unqualified to lead a nation and incapable of running a business. The exchange between the two figures highlights the tense relationship between Trump and Mexico, with Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's controversial policies and rhetoric.
