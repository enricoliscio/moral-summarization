SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly *rejected* Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that the Republican nominee is not welcome in the country due to his *demonization* of Mexicans. Fox *distrusts* Trump, calling him a "false prophet" who *cynically* disregards his own people and Mexicans. He believes Trump's changing ideas cannot be trusted and that his visit is a *desperate* attempt to boost his poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, stating that he is unfit to lead a nation or a business. Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox *disrespected* him by reminding him of his previous invitation to apologize to Mexicans. Fox's statement emphasized that Mexico is not a plaything and demanded respect.
END OF SUMMARY.
