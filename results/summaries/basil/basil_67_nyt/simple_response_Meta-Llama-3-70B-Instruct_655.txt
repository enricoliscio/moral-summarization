SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly condemned Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his demonization of Mexican people. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling him untrustworthy and cynical. He also expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump for a private meeting, suggesting that Trump's motive is to improve his sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he doesn't know how to run a nation or even a business. When Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had invited him to apologize to all Mexicans, not to use the country for his own gain. Fox's strong moral stance emphasizes the importance of respecting other nations and their people, and not using them for personal or political gain.
