SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly denounced Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, stating that he is not welcome in the country due to his derogatory remarks towards Mexicans and his proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. Fox expressed disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting that Trump's visit is a desperate attempt to boost his declining poll numbers. He urged Americans not to support Trump, citing his lack of qualifications and trustworthiness. In response to Fox's criticism, Trump pointed out that Fox had previously invited him to Mexico, to which Fox countered that the invitation was for Trump to apologize to Mexicans. Fox emphasized that Mexico should not be treated as a pawn and demanded respect from Trump.
