SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly denounced Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that the Mexican people reject him due to his demonization of their country and its citizens. Fox expressed disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting that Trump is merely using the visit as a desperate attempt to bolster his declining popularity. He urged Americans not to trust Trump, calling him a false prophet who disrespects both his own people and Mexicans. In response to Trump's claims that Mexico will pay for his proposed border wall, Fox reiterated that this will never happen and demanded an apology from Trump for his offensive remarks. Fox's stance highlights the moral outrage felt by many Mexicans towards Trump's divisive and derogatory rhetoric, underscoring the deep-seated tensions between the two nations.
