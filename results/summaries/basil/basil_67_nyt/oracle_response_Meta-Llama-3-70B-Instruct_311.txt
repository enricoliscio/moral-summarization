SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling the invitation a "mistake" and stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexican people and his plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He also expressed distrust of Trump's changing stance on deporting undocumented immigrants, saying "you cannot trust a guy like this" who "cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans." Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he doesn't know how to "run a nation" and has a history of "lying" and being "misleading." Trump responded to Fox's attacks on Twitter, but Fox fired back, reminding Trump that he had invited him to apologize to Mexicans and to "show some respect." Fox's strong words highlight the deep concerns about Trump's character and policies.
