SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his demonization of Mexican people. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling him untrustworthy and cynical. He also expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump for a private meeting, suggesting it's a desperate attempt to improve Trump's sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, citing his lack of experience in running a nation or even a business. The two exchanged blows on Twitter, with Fox reminding Trump that he was invited to apologize to all Mexicans, not to use the country for his own gain. Fox's strong moral stance emphasizes the importance of respecting other nations and their people, and warns against Trump's divisive and harmful rhetoric.
