Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the reactions from Vicente Fox. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump is heading to Mexico to meet with President Peña Nieto. Then, it talks about Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president, who is against Trump's visit. Fox says the invitation was a mistake and that Trump shouldn't be trusted because he's been demonizing Mexicans. He explicitly says Trump isn't welcome and criticizes Trump's border wall plan and his changing immigration policies. Fox also doubts Trump's ability to run a country or a business and thinks Trump's visit is just to boost his polls. Trump responds by pointing out Fox once invited him to visit Mexico, and Fox counters by saying Trump should apologize and stop lying.

So, the key points are:
1. Trump is visiting Mexico, invited by Peña Nieto.
2. Fox criticizes the invitation, calling it a mistake.
3. Fox doesn't trust Trump due to his negative comments and policies towards Mexico.
4. Fox criticizes Trump's wall plan and inconsistent immigration stance.
5. Fox doubts Trump's leadership abilities.
6. Trump and Fox exchange tweets about the invitation and apologies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and opinions without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's visit, then Fox's criticism, followed by the reasons, and end with their social media exchange.

I should make sure to include Fox's main arguments against Trump, his disbelief in Trump's leadership, and the mutual accusations on Twitter. Also, note that Fox thinks Trump's visit is a political move to improve his polls.

Let me draft this, keeping it concise and within the word limit.
