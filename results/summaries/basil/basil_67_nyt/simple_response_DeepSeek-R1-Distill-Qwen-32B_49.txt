Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the ethical implications and the strong opinions expressed.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, is criticizing Donald Trump for his visit, calling it a mistake. He's upset about Trump's immigration policies, the wall, and Trump's untrustworthiness. Fox is also doubting Trump's leadership abilities and advising Americans not to vote for him. Trump, on the other hand, is responding by pointing out that Fox once invited him, but Fox denies that and insists Trump should apologize.

I need to capture the moral aspects here. Fox is emphasizing the negative impact of Trump's policies on Mexicans and the lack of trustworthiness. There's a clear moral stance against Trump's approach, highlighting the disrespectful and harmful nature of his policies. The summary should reflect Fox's strong disapproval and the underlying ethical concerns.

I'll structure the summary to include Fox's main criticisms, his disbelief in Trump's intentions, the call for Americans not to vote for Trump, and the exchange on Twitter. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, making sure to highlight the moral framing without getting bogged down in details.

Now, putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that starts with Fox's rejection of Trump's visit, his reasons, and the implications. I'll ensure it's clear and within the word limit, ending with the Twitter exchange to show the ongoing conflict.

SUMMARY: Vicente Fox, Mexico's former president, has strongly condemned Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and stating that Trump is "not welcome here." Fox criticized Trump for demonizing Mexicans, his border wall plan, and his shifting immigration policies, arguing that Trump cannot be trusted. He also dismissed Trump's claims that Mexico would pay for the wall and labeled Trump a "false prophet." Fox accused Trump of pursuing the visit as a "desperate" move to boost his sagging poll numbers and urged Americans not to vote for him, questioning Trump's ability to lead. Trump responded by referencing Fox's prior invitation to visit Mexico, but Fox fired back, demanding Trump apologize to Mexicans and calling for respect. The exchange highlights the deep moral and political divide over Trump's policies and their impact on U.S.-Mexico relations. END OF SUMMARY.
