Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and Vicente Fox's response. The task is to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. Vicente Fox is criticizing Trump for his immigration policies and his visit to Mexico. He's calling Trump untrustworthy, a false prophet, and criticizing his policies as cynical and disrespectful.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral implications. I'll go through the article line by line.

- "You are not welcome here." The word "welcome" isn't morally charged, but "not welcome" implies rejection, which is a moral stance.
- "You are not welcome here. Vicente Fox... said... that the invitation... was a mistake." "Mistake" is a moral judgment on Peña Nieto's decision.
- "should never be trusted" – "trusted" is a moral word.
- "demonized" – clearly a moral term.
- "not welcome to Mexico" – same as before.
- "reject his visit" – "reject" is a moral choice.
- "critical of Trump’s plan to build a wall" – "critical" is a moral evaluation.
- "softening his plans to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants" – "deport" and " undocumented" are neutral, but "softening" is about changing stance, which Fox disapproves of.
- "You cannot trust a guy like this" – "trust" again.
- "grant confidence and support to ideas that change everyday" – "confidence" and "support" are moral.
- "cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans" – "cynically" and "disregard" are moral terms.
- "Trump’s promises that Mexico will pay for his border wall" – "promises" is neutral, but the context is about broken promises, which is moral.
- "vowed... it would never happen" – "vowed" is a commitment, which is moral.
- "false prophet" – definitely a moral term.
- "misleading his followers" – "misleading" is moral.
- "desperate strategy to improve his sagging poll numbers" – "desperate" and "sagging" are neutral, but "strategy" is about intent.
- "urged Americans not to vote for him" – "urged" is a moral appeal.
- "cannot envision him sitting in that chair" – "envision" is about worthiness, which is moral.
- "doesn’t know how to run a nation" – "know" is about capability, but in context, it's a moral judgment on fitness for office.
- "doesn’t even know how to run a business" – same as above.
- "Trump responded... on Twitter" – neutral.
- "Fox fired back" – "fired back" is a bit aggressive, which is a moral tone.
- "Stop lying!" – "lying" is a clear moral term.
- "Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect." – "play with" and "respect" are moral.

So compiling all these, the morally framed words are: mistake, trusted, demonized, reject, critical, softening, trust, confidence, support, cynically, disregard, vowed, false, misleading, desperate, urged, envision, know, fired, lying, play, respect.

Wait, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through again.

In the article, words like "false prophet," "misleading," "lying," "disregard," "cynically," "trust," "welcome," "reject," "critical," "softening," "vowed," "envision," "know," "fired," "play," "respect." I think I got them all.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The summary should capture the essence of Fox's criticism, Trump's response, and the moral framing.

I'll structure it by mentioning Fox's disapproval, the reasons (demonizing, wall, deportation), his disbelief in Trump's intentions, the invitation as a mistake, and the back-and-forth on Twitter. I'll ensure to use the moral terms identified.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. I'll start with Fox's statement, then his reasons, Trump's visit, Fox's disbelief, the invitation as a mistake, and end with their Twitter exchange.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all the moral words and keep it concise.

* trusted  
* demonized  
* reject  
* critical  
* softening  
* trust  
* confidence  
* support  
* cynically  
* disregard

**SUMMARY:**  
Vicente Fox, Mexico’s former president, strongly criticized Donald Trump, calling his visit to Mexico a mistake and stating, "He is not welcome here." Fox condemned Trump for demonizing Mexicans and his plans to build a border wall, asserting that Trump cannot be trusted. He dismissed Trump’s recent softened stance on deporting undocumented immigrants, labeling it cynical and untrustworthy. Fox also accused Trump of being a "false prophet" and misleading his followers. He expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Peña Nieto would invite Trump, suggesting the visit was a desperate attempt to boost Trump’s sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, questioning his ability to lead and run a business. Trump responded on Twitter, but Fox fired back, demanding respect and accusing Trump of lying. The exchange highlights the deep moral and political divide between the two leaders.
