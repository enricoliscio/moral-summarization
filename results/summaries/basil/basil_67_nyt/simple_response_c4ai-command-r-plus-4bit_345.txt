SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly denounced Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and asserting that Trump is not welcome in the country. Fox, who served as Mexico's president from 2000 to 2006, has been a vocal critic of Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies targeting Mexicans and immigrants. He rejects Trump's proposal to build a border wall and believes Trump cannot be trusted due to his shifting positions and disregard for Mexicans. Fox expresses disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting that Trump's visit is a desperate attempt to bolster his poll numbers. He urges Americans not to support Trump, citing his unfitness for leadership and lack of respect for Mexico. In response to Trump's defense, Fox reminds him of his invitation to apologize to Mexicans, highlighting Trump's dishonesty and disrespect for Mexico. Fox's stance underscores the moral outrage in Mexico and beyond over Trump's inflammatory statements and policies.
