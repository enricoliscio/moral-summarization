SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has expressed strong *rejection* of Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his *demonized* and *cynical* portrayal of Mexicans. Fox emphasizes that Trump cannot be trusted due to his *false* and *misleading* statements, and his *disrespect* towards Mexicans and his own people. Trump's promise to build a wall on the border and make Mexico pay for it has been met with strong opposition by Fox, who vows it will never happen. The former president also criticizes the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, suggesting it was a mistake and that Trump is only visiting as a *desperate* attempt to boost his poll numbers. Fox urges Americans not to support Trump, highlighting his lack of qualifications and ability to run a nation or business. As the moral summarizer assistant, I can conclude that Fox's statements emphasize the moral framing of Trump's actions and words as disrespectful, untrustworthy, and a threat to the relationship between Mexico and the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
