SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, calling it a mistake and expressing disbelief at the invitation extended by current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. Fox, who has been critical of Trump's controversial border wall proposal and his demonization of Mexicans, believes Trump is untrustworthy and should not be allowed to use Mexico as a political pawn in his desperate attempt to boost his poll numbers. In a strong moral stance against Trump's divisive and disrespectful rhetoric towards Mexico, Fox urges Americans not to support a candidate who lacks the qualifications and integrity to lead a nation. He emphasizes that Trump is unfit to occupy the office held by great American presidents of the past. Trump's response to Fox's statements, twisting the truth, only further exemplifies his lack of respect for Mexico and its people. Fox stands firm in his rejection of Trump's policies and demands respect for his country.
