SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country due to his demonization of Mexican people. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling him untrustworthy and cynical. He also expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump for a private meeting, suggesting that Trump's true intention is to boost his sagging poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he lacks the ability to run a nation or even a business. In a Twitter exchange, Fox reminded Trump that he once invited him to apologize to all Mexicans, and told him to "stop lying" and show respect for Mexico. Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies is a clear warning to Americans about the dangers of electing a leader who disrespects and demonizes entire groups of people.
