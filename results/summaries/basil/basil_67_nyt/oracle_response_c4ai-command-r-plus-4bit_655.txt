SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has publicly criticized the decision of current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to invite Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to Mexico, calling it a mistake and expressing his rejection of the visit. Fox's stance stems from Trump's demonization of Mexicans and his controversial plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, with Mexico footing the bill. Fox has consistently voiced his opposition to Trump's proposals, including the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, and has branded Trump as untrustworthy due to his shifting positions. In Fox's view, Trump lacks the qualifications to lead a nation and is disrespectful towards Mexico. He urged Americans not to support Trump and emphasized that Mexico should not be treated as a plaything. Despite their differences, Trump accepted Fox's earlier invitation to visit Mexico and address the people he has offended. However, Fox countered that the invitation was contingent on Trump offering an apology, highlighting Trump's tendency to lie.
