SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling the invitation a "mistake" and stating that Trump is not welcome in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and his plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He also expressed distrust in Trump's changing stance on deporting undocumented immigrants, saying "You cannot trust a guy like this" who "cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans." Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, calling him a "false prophet" who is "misleading" his followers. Trump responded to the criticism on Twitter, but Fox fired back, telling Trump to "stop lying" and show some respect to Mexico. Fox's strong words convey a sense of moral outrage at Trump's actions and rhetoric.
