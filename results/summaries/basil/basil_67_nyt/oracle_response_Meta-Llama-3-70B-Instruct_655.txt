SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has slammed Donald Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico, calling the invitation a "mistake" and stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump for "demonizing" Mexicans and his plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He also expressed distrust in Trump's changing stance on deporting undocumented immigrants, saying "you cannot trust a guy like this" who "cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans." Fox vowed that Mexico would never pay for the border wall, calling Trump a "false prophet" who is "misleading" his followers. He urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he doesn't know how to "run a nation" or even a business. In response to Trump's tweets, Fox fired back, telling him to "stop lying" and show some respect, reminding him that he was invited to apologize to all Mexicans, not to "play" with the country.
