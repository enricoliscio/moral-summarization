Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the reactions from Vicente Fox. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Trump is going to meet with President Pe単a Nieto. But Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president, isn't happy about it. He says Trump isn't welcome and that Pe単a Nieto made a mistake by inviting him. Fox criticizes Trump's border wall plan and his changing policies on deportations. He doesn't trust Trump because his positions change so much. Fox also doubts Mexico will pay for the wall and calls Trump a "false prophet."

Then, Fox questions why Pe単a Nieto would invite Trump, thinking it's just a political move to boost Trump's polls. He urges Americans not to vote for Trump and doubts Trump's ability to lead. Trump responds on Twitter, mentioning Fox suggested a visit before, but Fox fired back, telling Trump to apologize and stop lying.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's visit and Fox's opposition. Mention the criticisms about the wall and deportations. Highlight Fox's distrust and the invitation's context. Then note their Twitter exchange. Keep it concise, making sure all key points are included without getting too detailed.
