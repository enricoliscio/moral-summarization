Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Vicente Fox. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Trump is going to Mexico to meet with President Peña Nieto. But Vicente Fox, a former president, isn't happy about it. He says Trump isn't welcome because of his negative comments about Mexicans and the wall. Fox thinks Peña Nieto made a mistake by inviting Trump.

I should mention Trump's plans for the wall and Fox's criticism of that. Also, Fox doesn't believe Trump's recent softer stance on deportations. He doesn't trust Trump because his policies keep changing.

I need to include Fox's strong words about Trump not being fit to be president, comparing him to past leaders. Also, the exchange on Twitter where Trump and Fox argue about the invitation and apologies.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Focus on the key points: Fox's rejection, reasons, criticism of Trump's policies, and their Twitter exchange.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's visit, Fox's opposition, reasons, criticism of Trump's policies, and the social media response. Make sure to highlight the main arguments without getting too detailed.

Check for any important details I might have missed, like Fox's disbelief in Trump's poll strategy and his call for Americans not to vote for Trump. Also, mention Trump's response on Twitter.

Okay, I think I have all the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.
