SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is not welcome in the country due to his demonization of Mexican people. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a border wall and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling him untrustworthy and cynical. He also expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump for a private meeting, suggesting that Trump's visit is a desperate attempt to improve his poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he lacks the ability to run a nation or even a business. In a Twitter exchange, Fox reminded Trump that he once invited him to visit Mexico and apologize to its people, and told him to "stop lying" and show respect for the country.
