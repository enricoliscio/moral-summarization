SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized Trump's plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and his intention to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, calling him "cynical" and "misleading". Fox also expressed disbelief that current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto would invite Trump for a private meeting, suggesting that Trump is only trying to improve his "sagging" poll numbers. Fox urged Americans not to vote for Trump, saying he "doesn't know how to run a nation" and "doesn't even know how to run a business". In a Twitter exchange, Fox reminded Trump that he once invited him to apologize to all Mexicans, telling him to "stop lying" and "show some respect". Fox's strong words reflect his moral outrage at Trump's actions and rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
