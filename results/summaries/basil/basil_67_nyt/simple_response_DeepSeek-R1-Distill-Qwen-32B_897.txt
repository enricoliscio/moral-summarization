Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the reactions from Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president. Fox is critical of Trump, saying he's not welcome in Mexico because of Trump's negative remarks about Mexicans and his policies like the border wall and deportations.

I should focus on the moral aspects here. Fox is emphasizing the lack of trust in Trump, his inconsistent policies, and the disrespectful nature of Trump's approach. It's important to highlight Fox's disapproval and the reasons behind it, such as Trump's demonization of Mexicans and the wall issue.

Also, Trump's response on Twitter is a point to include, showing the ongoing conflict between them. The moral framing is about respect, trust, and the impact of Trump's policies on Mexican people.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the essence of Fox's criticism and the underlying moral issues. I'll structure it by mentioning Fox's disapproval, his reasons, and Trump's reaction, all while highlighting the moral stance against Trump's actions.

SUMMARY: Vicente Fox, Mexico's former president, has strongly criticized Donald Trump, stating that he is "not welcome" in Mexico due to Trump's demonization of Mexicans and his border wall plan. Fox accused Trump of being untrustworthy and inconsistent, calling him a "false prophet" who disrespects both Mexicans and his own people. He also dismissed Trump's claims that Mexico would pay for the wall, vowing it would never happen. Fox suggested Trump's visit to Mexico, at the invitation of current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, was a political move to boost Trump's lagging poll numbers. He urged Americans not to vote for Trump, questioning his ability to lead. Trump responded on Twitter, referencing Fox's prior invitation for him to visit Mexico and apologize. Fox fired back, demanding respect and calling Trump's actions disrespectful. The exchange highlights growing tensions between Trump and Mexican leaders over immigration and border policies.
