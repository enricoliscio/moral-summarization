SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, in his inaugural address, vowed to "fight" for the country "with every breath" and restore prosperity to America. He promised to "bring back" jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism. Trump's speech was heavy on populist themes, appealing to a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, which he believes will overcome prejudice and division. He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying they have reaped the rewards while the people did not "share" in the wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, vowing never to "let" them down. He promised "action" and concrete results, saying "the time for empty talk is over." Trump's address was met with protests and disruptions, but he remains committed to making America "great again."
