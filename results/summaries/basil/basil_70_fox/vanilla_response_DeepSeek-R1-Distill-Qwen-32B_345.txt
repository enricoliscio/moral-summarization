Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Donald Trump became the 45th President of the US, delivering a tough inaugural address. He focused on populist themes, promising to restore prosperity and fight for the country. His speech was short and didn't go into policy details but revisited his 2016 campaign topics like trade, immigration, and national security.

He talked about a "new national pride" and patriotism, addressing the country's divisions. He criticized Washington elites for not sharing the wealth with the people. Trump emphasized bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and vowed to fight Islamic terrorism. He closed with the "Make America Great Again" slogan.

The article also notes the political transition, with Obama leaving the White House, and Trump's administration planning to undo Obama's policies. There were protests and some Democrats boycotting the ceremony, while others attended, including Hillary Clinton.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Trump's inauguration, key themes of his speech, his promises, the political transition, and the protests. I'll make sure to mention the bipartisan attendance and the challenges ahead.

Let me structure this into a clear, coherent summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.
