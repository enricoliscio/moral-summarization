SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, delivering a populist-themed speech that vowed to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country. He promised concrete results, saying "the time for empty talk is over" and appealed for a "new national pride" to heal the country's divisions. Trump rebuked Washington's power elite, saying they reaped rewards while the people did not share in the wealth. He lamented job losses to foreign rivals, crime in cities, and vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, promising to "make America great again." He will immediately face the challenge of governing, with his team vowing a "robust" start, including rescinding Obama actions, renegotiating trade deals, and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Protests and disruptions occurred on the edges of the security zone, with dozens of arrests.
