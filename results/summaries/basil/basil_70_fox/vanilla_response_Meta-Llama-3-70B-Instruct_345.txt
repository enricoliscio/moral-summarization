SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." In his inaugural address, Trump promised concrete results and told Americans they will "never be ignored again." He appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, rebuking those who have held power in Washington. Trump lamented job losses to foreign rivals, crime in cities, and vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism. He promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to make America great again. The address was heavy on populist themes, reprising objectives from his 2016 campaign. Trump's presidency marks a return to power for the people, and he vowed never to let them down. He will immediately face the challenge of governing, with his team vowing a "robust" start to the Trump administration.
