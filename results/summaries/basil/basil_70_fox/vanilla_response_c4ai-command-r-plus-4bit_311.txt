SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, delivering a tough and populist inaugural address that vowed to put "America first." In his speech, Trump promised to restore prosperity, fight for the country, and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He decried the state of the nation, describing "rusted out factories" and "American carnage," and rebuked the Washington establishment for reaping the rewards of government while the people suffered. Trump's address also touched on themes of patriotism and national pride, and he pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism. The new president's team has promised a "robust" start to his administration, facing immediate challenges such as confirming Cabinet nominees and governing with a divided nation. Protesters disrupted the inauguration, clashing with police and causing arrests, while many House Democrats boycotted the ceremonies. Trump's remarkable rise to power, from political outsider to the most powerful man in the country, was highlighted by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. The inauguration marked the end of the Obama era and the beginning of the Trump presidency, with the new leader promising to make America great again.
