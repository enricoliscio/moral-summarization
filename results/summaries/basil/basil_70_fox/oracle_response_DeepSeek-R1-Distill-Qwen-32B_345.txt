Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump became president, gave an inaugural speech focusing on populist themes, promised action, talked about restoring prosperity, fighting for the country, and mentioned issues like trade, immigration, and national security. He criticized Washington elites, emphasized patriotism, and vowed to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. There were protests and some Democrats boycotting, but others attended the ceremony. The Obamas met with the Trumps, and Hillary Clinton attended, tweeting about democracy.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like restore, prosperity, fight, ignored, action, pride, patriotism, prejudice, share, history, lost, crime, carnage, stops, bring, eradicate, terrorism, make, great, disruptions, blocked, closure, violence, vandalism, clashed, honor, believing.

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Trump becoming president and his vows to restore prosperity and fight for the country. Mention the speech's focus on action, addressing issues like trade and immigration. Highlight his criticism of Washington elites and emphasis on patriotism. Include the promise to bring back jobs, borders, etc., and the mention of eradicating terrorism. Note the protests and disruptions, clashes, and the presence of Hillary Clinton honoring democracy. End with the transfer of power and making America great again.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, uses as many moral words as possible, and stays within 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.
