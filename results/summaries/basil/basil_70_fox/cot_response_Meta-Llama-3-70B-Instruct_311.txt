SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to "fight" for the country "with every breath" and restore prosperity. In his inaugural address, he appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, saying "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, promising to eradicate Islamic terrorism and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He vowed to "never, ever let you down" and make America "great again." The address was marked by a sense of "hour of action" and a rejection of "empty talk." END OF SUMMARY.
