SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, delivering a populist inaugural address that vowed to put "America first." In his speech, Trump promised to restore prosperity, fight for the country, and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He also rebuked Washington elites and appealed for a rediscovery of American patriotism to heal the nation's divisions. Trump's rise to power marks a historic shift, as he is the first president with no prior political or military experience. Protests and disruptions marked the inauguration, while many House Democrats boycotted the event. Trump's team has promised a robust start to his administration, facing immediate challenges in governing and confirming Cabinet nominees. Trump's address reiterated campaign themes of trade, immigration, and national security, and closed with his signature promise to "Make America Great Again." Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton was one of the biggest upsets in modern political history.
