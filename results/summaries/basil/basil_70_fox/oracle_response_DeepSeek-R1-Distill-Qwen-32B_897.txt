Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should end with specific tokens.

First, I need to understand the article thoroughly. It's about Donald Trump's inauguration, his speech, and the surrounding events. The author uses several morally charged words, so I need to ensure those are included in the summary. I should identify the key points of the article: Trump's promises, the themes of his speech, the protests, and the transition of power.

I should start by noting the main elements: Trump becoming president, his inaugural address focusing on prosperity, fighting for the country, and the themes of populism and patriotism. I need to include words like "restore," "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," and "action." 

Next, the speech's content about not being ignored, ending empty talk, and taking action. Also, the call for national pride and patriotism, opposing prejudice. The mention of Washington's wealth not being shared and the critique of those in power should be included using words like "share" and "prejudice."

I should also cover the administration's plans, like repealing the Affordable Care Act and confirming Cabinet nominees, while noting the resistance from Democrats. The protests and disruptions are another key point, with words like "disruptions," "blocked," "violence," and "vandalism."

Finally, the positive note with Hillary Clinton attending and honoring democracy, and the peaceful transition with the Obamas. I need to make sure the summary flows well, hits all these points, and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it to cover Trump's promises, the speech's themes, the administration's plans, the protests, and the transition, all while incorporating the morally framed words.
