SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, delivering a populist inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. In his speech, Trump promised to put America first and fight for the interests of the American people, including bringing back jobs, securing borders, and restoring national wealth and pride. He also rebuked Washington's political elite, promising to end their perceived stranglehold on power. Trump's victory marks a significant shift in the country's political landscape, as he is the first president with no prior political or military experience. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, highlighted this as a positive, suggesting Trump is not beholden to special interests. The inauguration was met with protests and boycotts from Democrats, while others, including past presidents and Hillary Clinton, attended the transfer of power. Trump's team has promised a robust start to his administration, with plans to reshape the country's policies and image.
