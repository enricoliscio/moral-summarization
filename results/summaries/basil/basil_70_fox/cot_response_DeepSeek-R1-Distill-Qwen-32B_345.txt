Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Donald Trump's inauguration and his speech. They want me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context and identify the key morally charged terms. The article talks about Trump's inauguration, his promises, the themes of his speech, and the reactions from different groups. I need to pick out words that carry moral weight, like "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," "empty talk," "action," "patriotism," "prejudice," "reaped rewards," "success," "corruption," "carnage," "let down," "America first," "Islamic terrorism," "disruption," "violence," "values," "democracy," "upset," "honor," "believe," and "future."

Next, I'll structure the summary to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: Trump's promises, the themes of his speech, the political climate, and the reactions from different groups. I should also mention the inauguration ceremony and the transition of power, including the presence of Obama, Melania, and Hillary Clinton.

I'll start by stating that Trump became president, emphasizing his promises to restore prosperity and fight for the country. I'll mention the themes of his speech, like patriotism and unity, and his criticism of Washington's elite. Then, I'll touch on his plans and the immediate challenges, like getting his Cabinet confirmed. I'll also include the protests and the presence of political figures at the inauguration.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the morally framed words without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to make sure it's concise and within the limit. Finally, I'll end the summary with the key phrase "make America great again" to tie it all together.

His inaugural address emphasized patriotism, unity, and a "new national pride," while criticizing Washington's elite for neglecting the people. He promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, declaring "America first." Trump also pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism and end the "American carnage" of lost jobs and crime. His speech, devoid of policy details, echoed campaign themes of trade, immigration, and national security. Protesters disrupted the event, clashing with police, while some Democrats boycotted the ceremony. Hillary Clinton attended, honoring democracy and its values. Trump's transition included meeting the Obamas and planning a robust start to his administration, with Cabinet confirmations pending. The inauguration marked a historic shift, as Trump, a political outsider, vowed to never let the American people down, closing with the promise: "We will make America great again." END OF SUMMARY.
