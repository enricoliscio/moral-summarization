SUMMARY:
Donald Trump, in his inaugural address, vowed to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." He promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism. Trump's speech was heavy on populist themes, appealing to a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, which he said would leave "no room for prejudice." He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, vowing never to let them down. "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now," he said. With his presidency, Trump promised to make America "great again." END OF SUMMARY.
