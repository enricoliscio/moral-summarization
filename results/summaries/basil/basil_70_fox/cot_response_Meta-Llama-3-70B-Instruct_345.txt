SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." In his inaugural address, he appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, emphasizing that "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down, promising to eradicate Islamic terrorism and bring back American jobs, borders, wealth, and "dreams." He closed his speech with the promise to "make America great again." As he begins his presidency, Trump will face the challenge of governing and applying his CEO experience to running the nation.
