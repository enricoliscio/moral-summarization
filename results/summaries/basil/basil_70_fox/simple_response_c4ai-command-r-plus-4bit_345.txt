SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, delivering a tough and populist inaugural address in which he vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. He promised concrete action on trade, immigration, and national security, and appealed for a rediscovery of American patriotism to heal the nation's divisions. Trump's speech painted a bleak picture of the current state of the country, describing "rusted-out factories" and "American carnage," and positioned himself as a champion of the people, promising to put "America first." He pledged to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump's rise to power represents a unique moment in history, as a political outsider and businessman with no prior political or military experience assumes the nation's highest office. His address was a call to action, promising to fight for the American people and never let them down.
