Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by stating that Trump became the 45th president, vowing to restore prosperity and fight for the country. His speech was tough and populist, promising concrete results. He mentioned ending empty talk and starting action. The speech focused on themes from his campaign like trade, immigration, and national security, without going into policy details.

He talked about a new national pride and American patriotism as a way to heal the country's divisions. He criticized Washington elites for benefiting while others didn't. Trump's journey from outsider to president is highlighted, noting his business background and lack of political experience.

He criticized job losses and crime, vowing to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He also promised to fight Islamic terrorism and make America great again. The inauguration was marked by protests, with some disruptions and arrests. Despite some Democrats boycotting, others attended, including Hillary Clinton, who tweeted about honoring democracy.

The Obamas met the Trumps before the event, and the new administration faces challenges like confirming Cabinet nominees and governing.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on key points: Trump's inauguration, his vows, the themes of his speech, the mention of protests, and the transition of power.

I should ensure the summary is concise, covering all main points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to make sure it's under the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence captures the essence without extra fluff.

I'll start with Trump becoming president and his main promises. Then touch on the speech themes, his criticisms, and the inauguration events. Finally, mention the protests and the transition, including Clinton's attendance.

Let me check the word count as I go to stay within limits. I think that's a solid approach.
