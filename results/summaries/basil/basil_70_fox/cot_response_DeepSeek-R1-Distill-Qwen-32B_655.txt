Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify all the single words in the article that have a moral connotation. The user wants this step labeled as "STEP 1:" with each word on a new line starting with an asterisk. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," "results," "empty," "action," "patriotism," "prejudice," "power," "rewards," "wealth," "history," "pessimism," "carnage," "let down," "America first," "jobs," "borders," "wealth," "dreams," "terrorism," "moment," "great again," "governing," "challenge," "experience," "robust," "controversial," "renegotiating," "repeal," "replace," "Cabinet," "Democrats," "slow," "violence," "vandalism," "clashed," "arrests," "boycotted," "disputes," "honor," "democracy," "values," "believe," "future," "meet," "parade," "festivities."

Next, I have to write a summary that includes as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I need to ensure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll focus on the key points from the article: Trump's inauguration, his promises, the themes of patriotism and action, the challenges he faces, and the reactions from different groups.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's vows, the themes of his speech, the challenges ahead, and the political climate. I'll make sure to include words like "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," "action," "patriotism," "prejudice," "power," "rewards," "wealth," "history," "carnage," "let down," "America first," "jobs," "borders," "wealth," "dreams," "terrorism," "moment," "great again," "governing," "challenge," "experience," "robust," "controversial," "renegotiating," "repeal," "replace," "Cabinet," "Democrats," "slow," "violence," "vandalism," "clashed," "arrests," "boycotted," "disputes," "honor," "democracy," "values," "believe," "future," "meet," "parade," "festivities."

I'll start by stating Trump's assumption of office and his vows, then move into the themes of his speech, the challenges he faces, and the political reactions. I'll keep it concise, ensuring each sentence includes key moral words without making it too wordy. Finally, I'll end with the transition of power and the festivities, wrapping it up neatly.

Let me put this together, making sure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral terms. I need to check the word count to stay under 200 words. I'll also ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects as per the user's request.
