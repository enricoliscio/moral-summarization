SUMMARY:
Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, took office on Friday, vowing to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." In his inaugural address, he promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. He appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, saying "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." Trump rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. He cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, vowing never to let them down. "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now," Trump said, promising to make America "great again." END OF SUMMARY.
