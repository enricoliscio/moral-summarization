SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, delivering a tough and populist inaugural address that vowed to fight for the country and its people. He promised to restore prosperity, end the "American carnage" of lost jobs and crime, and prioritize America first in all decisions. Trump's speech appealed to patriotism as a unifier, dismissing prejudice and promising concrete action on trade, immigration, and national security. He also rebuked Washington's power elite, pledging to return power to the people. Trump's remarkable rise from political outsider to president marks a historic shift, bringing private sector success to Washington with a promise to 'drain the swamp'. His administration faces immediate challenges, including confirming Cabinet nominees and governing amidst protests and Democratic resistance. Trump's address closed with his campaign promise to "Make America Great Again," emphasizing his commitment to eradicating Islamic terrorism and restoring borders, jobs, wealth, and dreams.
