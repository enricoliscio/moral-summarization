SUMMARY: Donald Trump has become the 45th President of the United States, delivering a tough and succinct inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. In his speech, Trump appealed to populist themes, promising to take action on trade, immigration, and national security. He also emphasized the need for a "new national pride" and the rediscovery of American patriotism to heal the country's divisions. Trump's journey to the presidency is historic, as he is a political outsider and a successful businessman with no prior political or military experience. His address highlighted the loss of jobs to foreign rivals and crime in American cities, pledging to stop this "American carnage." He promised to put America first and fight for the people, bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump also committed to eradicating Islamic terrorism. The new president faces the challenge of governing and applying his CEO experience to run the nation, with a robust agenda that includes rescinding Obama-era actions, renegotiating trade deals, and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Protests disrupted the inauguration, with demonstrators blocking checkpoints, engaging in violence, and clashing with police. Despite the boycotts and disruptions, Trump's inauguration marked a historic transfer of power, with past presidents and political rivals in attendance to honor democracy and its enduring values.
