Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Donald Trump's inauguration, his speech, the themes he emphasized, and the context of the event. The moral framing here is about Trump's populist message, his promises to bring back American prosperity, and his call for unity through patriotism.

I should identify the key elements: Trump's inauguration, his vows to restore prosperity, the themes of his speech like trade, immigration, national security, the call for a new national pride, and his criticism of Washington's establishment. Also, the protesters and the political divide are important points.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects. I'll focus on Trump's promises, the populist themes, the contrast with the previous administration, and the symbolic aspects of his speech.

I should structure the summary to start with the inauguration, then his main promises, the themes of his speech, the moral call for unity, the criticism of the establishment, and the symbolic elements like making America great again. I'll also mention the political divide with the protesters and Hillary Clinton's presence.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and highlights the moral framing without going into too much detail. I'll avoid including unnecessary specifics like the weather or the events after the speech unless they add to the moral context.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered succinctly.
