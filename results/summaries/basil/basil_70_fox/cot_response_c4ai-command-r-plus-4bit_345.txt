SUMMARY: Donald Trump assumed the presidency of the United States on Friday, vowing to fight for the country and restore prosperity. In a tough inaugural address, he promised to put America first and to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's speech was heavy on populist themes and appealed for a new national pride and a rediscovery of patriotism as a salve for the country's divisions. He rebuked the powerful in Washington, saying they had reaped the rewards of government while the people had been ignored. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down. The new president also vowed to take action on trade, immigration, national security, and Islamic terrorism. The address completes Trump's remarkable journey from political outsider to the most powerful man in the country, and his team has vowed a robust start to his administration, including rescinding controversial Obama actions and repealing the Affordable Care Act. While Trump's inauguration was met with protests and boycotts from some Democrats, other prominent Democrats and past presidents attended the transfer of power, including Hillary Clinton, who tweeted her support for American democracy and its values. Donald and Melania Trump met with the Obamas and attended a church service before the parade and inaugural balls. END OF SUMMARY.
