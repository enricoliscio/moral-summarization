SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country. In his inaugural address, he vowed to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump's speech was heavy on populist themes, appealing to a "new national pride" and patriotism. He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying they reaped the rewards while the people did not share in the wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, vowing never to let them down. The address did not delve into policy details, but reprised objectives from his 2016 campaign on trade, immigration, and national security. Trump's team has vowed a "robust" start to the administration, which could include rescinding Obama actions, renegotiating trade deals, and repealing the Affordable Care Act.
