Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Donald Trump's inauguration, his speech, and the surrounding events. The morally framed words include "restore," "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," "action," "pride," "patriotism," "open," "prejudice," "share," "history," "lost," "scattered," "crime," "carnage," "stops," "let," "bring," "eradicate," "terrorism," "make," "great," "causing," "disruptions," "blocked," "forced," "closure," "violence," "vandalism," "clashed," "honor," "stop," "believing."

I need to craft a concise summary (under 200 words) that incorporates these words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Trump's inauguration, his vows to restore prosperity, his address focusing on action and patriotism, the mention of stopping American carnage, the opposition and protests, and the transition of power.

I should structure the summary to flow naturally, ensuring that the moral terms are seamlessly integrated. I'll also need to mention the protests and the contrasting presence of Hillary Clinton, as well as the peaceful transition despite the disruptions.

Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence includes the relevant moral words without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the summary captures the essence of the article while highlighting the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th U.S. president, vowing to restore prosperity and fight for the country. His inaugural address emphasized action over empty talk, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and American pride. He criticized Washington elites for ignoring the people and called for a return to patriotism, stating that prejudice has no place when the heart is open to love for the country. Trump also vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism and stop the "American carnage" of lost jobs and crime. Despite protests and disruptions, including violence and vandalism, the transition of power proceeded, with former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden attending the ceremony. Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump, honored democracy and its enduring values. Trump's team aims to make America great again, starting with swift policy changes. END OF SUMMARY.
