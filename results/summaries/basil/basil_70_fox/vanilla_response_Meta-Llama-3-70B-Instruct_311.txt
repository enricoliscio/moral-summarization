SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, delivering a populist-themed speech that vowed to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country. He promised concrete results and appealed for a "new national pride" to heal the country's divisions. Trump rebuked Washington's elite, saying they had reaped the rewards of government while the people did not share in the wealth. He lamented jobs lost to foreign rivals, crime in cities, and vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He closed his speech with the promise to "make America great again." The new administration faces the challenge of governing, with immediate tasks including confirming Cabinet nominees and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Despite protests and boycotts, prominent Democrats attended the inauguration, including Hillary Clinton.
