Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by talking about Trump becoming the 45th president, his inaugural address focusing on restoring prosperity and fighting for the country. He emphasizes populist themes, promising action and not just empty talk. He mentions bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He also talks about a new national pride and American patriotism as a way to heal divisions.

There's a moral aspect here. The author frames Trump's speech as a call to unity and patriotism, countering divisions. He also criticizes Washington insiders for not sharing the wealth with the people, which is a moral critique of the political establishment.

I should make sure the summary includes these elements: Trump's promises, the populist themes, the call for national pride, the critique of Washington, and the moral stance against divisions. Also, the transition from Obama to Trump, the protests, and the political challenges ahead are part of the context.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight Trump's main promises, the moral appeal, the criticism of the establishment, and the challenges he faces. I'll make sure to mention the protests and the political dynamics as well.

Wait, the user mentioned to preserve the moral framing. So I should focus on how Trump's speech is presented as a moral call to action, uniting the country and fighting for the people. The author's tone seems to present Trump as a disruptor of the political status quo, which is a moral statement about change and fairness.

I should also note the contrast between Trump's outsider status and his assumption of power, as well as the immediate challenges like Cabinet confirmations and policy changes. Including Hillary Clinton's presence and her message adds a moral dimension of respecting democracy despite the loss.

Putting it all together, the summary should encapsulate Trump's promises, the moral appeal in his speech, the critique of Washington, and the challenges ahead, all while staying within the word limit.
