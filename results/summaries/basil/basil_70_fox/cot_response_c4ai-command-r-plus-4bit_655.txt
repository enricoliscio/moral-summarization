SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, assuming the highest office with a populist and patriotic tone. In his inaugural address, he *vowed* to fight for the country and restore its prosperity, appealing to the people by promising to "fight" for them and ensure they will "never be *ignored* again." Trump's speech was *remarkable* for its blunt and unvarnished terms, lamenting the loss of jobs and the state of American cities, and he pledged to end the "American *carnage*". He *appealed* to a rediscovery of American *patriotism* as a way to heal the nation's divisions, asserting that when one opens their heart to patriotism, there is no room for *prejudice*. Trump also *rebuked* the Washington elite, promising to put the power back in the hands of the people and to be a president for all Americans. He promised *concrete* results and *action*, pledging to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. With his private sector success, Trump *assumed* the most *powerful* office as a political outsider, owing no one but the American people.
