Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the user's query carefully. They provided a detailed news article about Donald Trump's inauguration and his speech. The user also listed specific morally framed words that the author used, and they want the summary to include as many of these words as possible.

First, I'll go through the article to identify the main points. Trump became president, gave a speech focusing on restoring prosperity, fighting for the country, and addressing issues like trade, immigration, and national security. He emphasized action over talk, talked about a new national pride, and criticized Washington insiders. He also mentioned making America great again and dealing with issues like crime and terrorism.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words: restore, prosperity, fight, ignored, action, pride, patriotism, open, prejudice, share, history, lost, scattered, crime, carnage, stops, let, bring, eradicate, terrorism, make, great, causing, disruptions, blocked, forced, closure, violence, vandalism, clashed, honor, stop, believing.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's promises and the moral language. I'll mention his vows to restore prosperity, fight for the country, and the themes of patriotism and national pride. I'll also touch on the disruptions and protests, using words like causing, blocked, clashed, and violence. Finally, I'll include Hillary Clinton's honoring of democracy and her belief in the country's future.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll also make sure to include the transition of power and the inauguration events briefly.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each key moral word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to make sure it captures the essence of the article and the moral framing intended by the author.
