SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, in his inaugural address, vowed to "fight" for the country "with every breath" and restore prosperity, promising concrete results. He told Americans they will "never be ignored again" and appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, saying "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." Trump rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. He lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals, crime in America's cities, and vowed to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, promising to "bring back" jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He closed his speech with the promise to "make America great again." As protests and disruptions erupted on the edges of the security zone, Trump's team vowed a "robust" start to the administration, with an immediate task of getting Cabinet nominees confirmed.
