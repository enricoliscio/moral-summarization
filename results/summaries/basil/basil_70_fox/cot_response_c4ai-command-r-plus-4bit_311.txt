SUMMARY: 
Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing in his inaugural address to fight for the country and its people. In a speech laden with populist themes, he promised to restore prosperity and power to the American people, pledging that they would "never be ignored again." Trump rebuked the Washington establishment, lamenting the loss of jobs and the state of the nation's security. He described a bleak picture of "rusted out factories" and "American carnage," vowing to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. The address, heavy on patriotic sentiment, appealed for national pride and unity, asserting that "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." Trump also honored those who served before him, with past presidents of both parties in attendance, including Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whose defeat marked a stunning upset. Protests disrupted the day's proceedings, with House Democrats boycotting the ceremony and demonstrators clashing with police. Trump's team has promised a robust start to his administration, aiming to deliver swift action on campaign promises. Trump's journey from political outsider to the most powerful man in the nation is a testament to his success in the private sector, and his inauguration marks a historic shift in American politics.
