Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. I need to make sure I capture the key points without going over 200 words. First, I'll read through the article to identify the main events and themes.

The article mentions Trump becoming the 45th president, his inaugural address focusing on prosperity, fighting for the country, and populist themes. He talks about not being ignored and delivering results. There's a mention of the crowd and the weather, but maybe that's not crucial for the summary.

He doesn't delve into policies but revisits campaign topics like trade, immigration, and national security. Emphasizing a new national pride and patriotism to heal divisions. He criticizes Washington elites and connects with his business background. Also, he addresses job losses, crime, and eradicating Islamic terrorism.

The summary should include his promises to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and make America great again. The transition from Obama to Trump, the challenges ahead, and the political climate with protests and Democratic reactions. I need to keep it concise, focusing on Trump's main messages, his background, the inauguration events, and the political context.

I should structure it to start with Trump becoming president, his speech themes, key promises, the transition, and the political environment. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
