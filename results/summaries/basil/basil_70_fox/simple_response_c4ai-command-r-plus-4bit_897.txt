SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, delivering a populist and patriotic inaugural address that vowed to fight for the country and its people. In his speech, Trump promised to restore prosperity, end the "American carnage" of lost jobs and crime, and prioritize America first in all decisions. He rebuked the Washington establishment and promised concrete action on trade, immigration, national security, and the eradication of Islamic terrorism. Trump's rise to power is historic, as a political outsider and successful businessman, he brings a unique perspective to the White House. His team has promised a robust start to his administration, facing immediate challenges of governing and cabinet confirmation. Protests and boycotts by Democrats marked the inauguration, while past presidents and political rivals attended the transfer of power, including Hillary Clinton who tweeted her support for democracy. Trump's address appealed to patriotism as a unifying force, and he promised to never let the American people down as he fights for their interests.
