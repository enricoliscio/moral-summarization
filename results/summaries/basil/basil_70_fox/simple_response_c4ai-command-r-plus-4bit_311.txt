SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States, delivering a populist inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. He promised to put America first and fight for its people with every breath, bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's speech appealed for a new national pride and patriotism to heal divisions, and rebuked Washington elites for reaping the rewards of government while the people suffered. He also pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump's rise to power is a remarkable journey from political outsider to the most powerful man in the country, owing his success to his private sector experience and connection with the American people. His administration faces immediate challenges, including confirming Cabinet nominees and governing with his business-minded approach. Protests disrupted the inauguration, but the transfer of power was attended by past presidents and prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. Trump and his wife Melania met with the Obamas and participated in inaugural festivities. Trump's promise to make America great again underscores his commitment to fighting for the country and its people.
