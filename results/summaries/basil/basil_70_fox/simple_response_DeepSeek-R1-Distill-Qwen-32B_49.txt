Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about Trump becoming the 45th president, his inaugural address emphasizing populism, restoring prosperity, and fighting for the country. He mentions themes like trade, immigration, national security, and a new national pride. He criticizes the Washington elite and talks about bringing back jobs and borders. There's also mention of protests and the transition from Obama to Trump.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like his emphasis on patriotism, fighting for the people, and the contrast with the previous administration. Also, the protests and the political divide should be included to show the moral framing.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to highlight Trump's promises, the themes of his speech, and the context of his inauguration. I'll need to mention the protesters and the political reactions to show the broader moral implications.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, showing Trump's vision and the reactions from different groups.
