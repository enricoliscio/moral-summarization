SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, delivering a tough inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. He promised to take action on trade, immigration, and national security, and to bring a new sense of patriotism and national pride to heal the country's divisions. Trump decried the loss of jobs and the decline of industry, promising to put America first and fight for the American people. He also pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism. His speech was heavy on populist themes, promising to give power back to the people and ensure they are never ignored again. While protesters caused disruptions and clashed with police, the transfer of power was attended by past presidents and prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who tweeted about honoring democracy and its values. Trump's remarkable rise to power as a political outsider and businessman has defied expectations, and his team has promised a robust start to his administration, focusing on confirming Cabinet nominees and addressing key issues like trade deals and healthcare. Trump's inaugural address emphasized action over talk, with a strong moral framework of restoring pride, eradicating problems, and fighting for a better future.
END OF SUMMARY.
