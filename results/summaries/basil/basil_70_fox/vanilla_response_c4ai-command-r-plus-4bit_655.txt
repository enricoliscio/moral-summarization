SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, delivering a populist inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. In his speech, Trump promised to put America first and fight for the interests of the American people, including bringing back jobs, strengthening borders, and eradicating Islamic terrorism. He also rebuked the Washington establishment and pledged to bridge the country's divisions by appealing to patriotism. Trump's rise to power as a political outsider and businessman was noted, as was the presence of past presidents and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at the inauguration. Protests and disruptions marked the day, along with the challenge of governing that Trump now faces as he attempts to apply his private-sector experience to running the nation. His team has promised a robust start to his administration, including policy changes and a focus on confirming his Cabinet nominees.
