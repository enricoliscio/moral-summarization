Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through the article first to get the main points. 

The article starts by saying Trump became the 45th president, vowing to restore prosperity and fight for the country. His speech was tough and populist, promising action and not just empty talk. He addressed a crowd on a mild but overcast day after taking the oath with Mike Pence. The speech didn't go into policy details but revisited his campaign themes like trade, immigration, and national security. He emphasized a new national pride and patriotism to heal divisions, saying patriotism leaves no room for prejudice. He criticized Washington elites for not sharing wealth with the people. 

The article mentions his journey from a political outsider to the presidency, with his campaign manager noting his success in the private sector. Trump talked about lost jobs, rusted factories, and crime, vowing to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He promised to fight Islamic terrorism and make America great again. The inauguration faced protests with some disruptions and arrests. Democrats boycotted, but others attended, including Hillary Clinton, who honored democracy. The Obamas met the Trumps, and there were inaugural festivities.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's inauguration, his vows, the themes of his speech, the challenges, and the context of the event. I'll make sure to include key points like the populist message, promises to bring back American greatness, the mention of policy areas, and the political climate with protests and Democratic reactions.

I should structure it to start with Trump becoming president, his vows, the speech's themes, the address to the nation, the challenges he mentioned, his promises, the political backdrop with protests, and the transition from Obama to Trump.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. I'll ensure each sentence is concise and captures the essence without unnecessary details.
