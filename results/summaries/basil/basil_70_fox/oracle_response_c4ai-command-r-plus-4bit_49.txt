SUMMARY: Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, delivering a tough and succinct inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. In his speech, Trump appealed to populist themes and promised concrete action on trade, immigration, and national security. He decried the loss of jobs and the state of American cities, pledging to put an end to what he called "American carnage." Trump's address also emphasized a rediscovery of patriotism and "new national pride" as a way to bridge the country's divisions and eradicate prejudice. He criticized the Washington establishment for reaping the benefits of government while the people were left behind. Trump's journey to the presidency is historic, as he is an outsider with no political or military experience, and his victory over Hillary Clinton was one of the biggest upsets in modern political history. His inauguration was met with protests and disruptions, but Trump promised to fight for Americans and make America great again. He also vowed to take action on issues like trade deals and healthcare, and to confirm his Cabinet nominees despite resistance from Democrats. Trump's team has promised a robust start to his administration, signaling a break from the past and a focus on putting America first.
