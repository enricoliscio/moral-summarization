SUMMARY:
Donald Trump took office as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." In his inaugural address, he promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, saying "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, vowing never to let them down, and to make America great again. The address was marked by a sense of urgency, with Trump declaring "this American carnage stops right here and stops right now." END OF SUMMARY.
