SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to restore prosperity and fight for the country. In a heavy and populist inaugural address, he promised concrete action and appealed to a rediscovery of American patriotism, stitching together themes from his campaign with broader objectives. Trump rebuked Washington's political elite, reprised objectives from his campaign, and lamented the "American carnage" of lost jobs and crime. He closed his speech with the promise to "Make America Great Again." Trump's remarkable rise to power, from political outsider to president, was highlighted by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, as a historic moment for a political novice. Trump's address was heavy on populist themes, appealing to the American people and promising to fight for them and restore prosperity. The new president's team has promised a robust start to his administration, facing immediate challenges of governing and cabinet confirmation. Protests and boycotts by House Democrats marked the inauguration, while past presidents and political rivals attended the transfer of power. Trump's speech closed with the promise to "fight with every breath" for the American people and to make America great again.
