SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, delivering a tough and succinct inaugural address that vowed to restore prosperity and fight for the country. He promised to put America first and to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He also pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism and "make America great again." Trump's speech appealed to patriotism and a rediscovery of American pride as a way to heal the country's divisions and stop prejudice. He rebuked the Washington establishment, promising to give power back to the people who have been ignored for too long. Trump's journey to the presidency is historic, as he is a political outsider and a successful businessman with no political or military experience. His address also touched on the loss of jobs to foreign rivals and the need to take action against crime and violence in American cities. The new president closed his speech with a promise to never let the American people down. The day was marked by protests and disruptions, but also by the presence of prominent Democrats and past presidents honoring the peaceful transfer of power. Trump now faces the challenge of governing and keeping his promises to the American people.
