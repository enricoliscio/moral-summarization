SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, delivering a populist inaugural address that vowed to put "America first" and fight for the country's interests. In his speech, Trump promised to restore prosperity, bring back jobs and borders, and eradicate Islamic terrorism. He also rebuked Washington's political elite, pledging to return power to the people. The address was heavy on themes from his 2016 campaign, including trade, immigration, and national security. Trump's rise to power was unprecedented, as a political outsider and businessman with no prior political or military experience. Protests and disruptions marked the inauguration, while prominent Democrats and past presidents attended the transfer of power. Trump's team has promised a robust start to his administration, facing immediate challenges of governing and confirming Cabinet nominees. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, highlighted his unique position as a private sector success story coming to Washington "owing nobody anything." Trump closed his speech with his signature promise to "make America great again."
END OF SUMMARY.
