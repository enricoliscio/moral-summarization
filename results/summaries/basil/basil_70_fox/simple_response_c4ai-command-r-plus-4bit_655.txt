SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, delivering a tough and populist inaugural address that vowed to fight for the country and restore prosperity. He promised to put America first and to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He decried the state of the nation, describing "rusted-out factories" and "American carnage," and rebuked the Washington establishment for reaping the rewards of government while the people suffered. Trump's speech appealed to patriotism as a unifying force and a solution to the nation's divisions, claiming that "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." He also pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism. His rise to power represents a remarkable journey for a political outsider who successfully challenged the establishment. Trump's team has promised a robust start to his administration, and an immediate task will be to get his Cabinet nominees confirmed despite resistance from Democrats. Protests disrupted the inauguration, and House Democrats boycotted the ceremony, but Trump's speech appealed to the American people, closing with the promise to "make America great again."
END OF SUMMARY.
