SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." In his populist-themed speech, he vowed to prioritize America's interests, eradicate Islamic terrorism, and bring back jobs, borders, and wealth. Trump rebuked the Washington elite, saying they had reaped the rewards of government while the people did not share in the wealth. He appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, saying it would overcome prejudice. Trump's presidency marks a shift in power from the elite to the people, and he promised to never let them down. The speech was light on policy details but heavy on emotional appeal, as Trump sought to inspire a sense of national unity and purpose. As he takes office, Trump faces the challenge of governing, with a "robust" start to his administration planned.
