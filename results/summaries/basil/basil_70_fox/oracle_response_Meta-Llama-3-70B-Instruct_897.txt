SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to "fight" for the country and "restore" prosperity. In his inaugural address, he promised to "bring back" jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism. Trump appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism, saying "when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice." He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people, vowing never to "let them down." He promised to "make America great again," and to "stop" the "American carnage" of lost jobs and crime. Meanwhile, protesters caused disruptions and clashed with police, but prominent Democrats attended the ceremony, honoring the transfer of power. END OF SUMMARY.
