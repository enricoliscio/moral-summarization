Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user has given me a list of those words, so I need to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump became president, gave a speech emphasizing action and American values, talked about bringing back jobs and prosperity, criticized the previous administration, and faced protests. 

Now, I need to identify the key moral words from the list. Words like "restore," "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," "action," "pride," "patriotism," "prejudice," "share," "history," "lost," "crime," "carnage," "stop," "bring," "eradicate," "terrorism," "make," "great," "disruptions," "blocked," "violence," "vandalism," "honor," and "believing." 

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning Trump assuming the presidency and his vows to restore prosperity and fight for the country. Then, I'll touch on his speech themes of action, not being ignored, and the call for national pride and patriotism. 

I should also include how he criticized Washington's power structure and his promise to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Mentioning the eradication of Islamic terrorism and the closing line about making America great again is important. 

I'll also need to cover the protests, disruptions, violence, and vandalism, as well as the honoring of democracy by Hillary Clinton. Finally, I'll note the transition with the Obamas and the start of Trump's administration.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise, ensuring each key moral word is included without making it too lengthy. I'll make sure the flow is logical, starting from his inauguration, the speech content, the protests, and the transition of power.

Let me draft this, checking off each moral word as I include it. I'll make sure not to miss any important points and that the summary accurately reflects the article while maintaining the moral framing.
