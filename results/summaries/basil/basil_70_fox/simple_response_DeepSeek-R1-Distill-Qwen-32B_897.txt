Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump's speech focused on populism, promising action and prosperity. He criticized Washington elites and emphasized American patriotism. There were mentions of policy areas like trade and immigration, but no details. Also, there were protests and political tensions mentioned.

I should highlight the key themes: the populist message, the promise to fight for the country, the criticism of the political establishment, and the inauguration's context with protests and political division. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone, which includes both the hopeful aspects of renewal and the underlying tensions.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's vows, the themes of the speech, the criticisms, the policy areas, and the inauguration's surrounding events like protests and political opposition. I'll make sure to mention Hillary Clinton's presence and the symbolic meeting with the Obamas to show the transition's significance.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, covers all essential points without getting too detailed, and reflects the moral framing by showing both the hopeful and the divisive aspects of the event. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, making sure the summary is balanced yet comprehensive within the word limit.
