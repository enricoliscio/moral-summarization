Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration, but they specifically mentioned preserving the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without adding my own bias. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump's inauguration, his speech focusing on populism, American pride, and promises to bring back jobs and security. He criticized the political establishment and emphasized action over talk. The article also mentions the protesters and the transition from Obama to Trump.

Now, the moral framing. The author seems to present Trump as a disruptor, someone who's challenging the status quo. He's positioning himself as the voice of the people, which is a strong moral stance. Also, the contrast between Trump and Obama is there, with the protesters showing the divide.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's inauguration and his key promises. Then touch on the themes of populism and American pride. Mention the criticism of Washington and the call to action. Also, include the protesters and the symbolic moment of transition.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the moral aspects without leaning too much in any direction. It's about Trump's vision and the reactions, both positive and negative. Keeping it balanced is key here.

Let me structure it: start with the inauguration, his speech themes, promises, criticism, mention the protesters and the transition. Keep it concise but cover all the main moral points the author highlighted.

I think that should cover it. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary elements while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. President, delivering a populist speech focused on restoring American prosperity, patriotism, and unity. He vowed to fight for the country, bring back jobs, borders, and wealth, and emphasized action over empty promises. Trump criticized Washington elites for enriching themselves while neglecting the people, calling for a return to "America first" and a rejection of political correctness. His speech, heavy on campaign themes like trade, immigration, and national security, also addressed the nation's divisions, advocating for patriotism as a unifying force. Trump's journey from political outsider to the presidency was marked by his business success and lack of prior political experience. The inauguration coincided with protests, including clashes between demonstrators and police, highlighting the nation's divisions. The ceremony also marked the symbolic transfer of power from Barack Obama to Trump, with Hillary Clinton attending to honor democracy. Trump's administration faces immediate challenges, including Cabinet confirmations and implementing his CEO-style governance. END OF SUMMARY.
