Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure to stick to that. 

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a positive or negative moral connotation. Words like "prosperity," "fight," "ignored," "empty talk," "action," "patriotism," "prejudice," "reaped," "wealth," "history," "success," "corruption," "carnage," "return," "let down," "America first," "jobs," "borders," "wealth," "dreams," "eradicate," "greatness," "disruptions," "violence," "vandalism," "clashed," "arrests," "boycotted," "values," "democracy," "believe," "future." I think these words carry moral weight in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the key points of Trump's inauguration, his promises, the moral themes, and the context of the political climate. I'll start by mentioning Trump's inauguration and his vows to restore prosperity and fight for the country. I'll touch on his populist themes, the address's focus on trade, immigration, and national security, and the call for a new national pride. I'll include his criticism of Washington's corruption and his promises to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Also, I'll note the moral framing in his speech, the protesters, and the political divisions. I'll end with the peaceful transition and Clinton's support for democracy.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the important points while preserving the moral language. I should avoid adding any new information not present in the article and keep it within the word limit. Let me put it all together now, ensuring that the morally framed words are included and the summary is clear and concise.
