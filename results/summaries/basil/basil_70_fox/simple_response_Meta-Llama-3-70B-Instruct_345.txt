SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore prosperity and "fight" for the country "with every breath." In his inaugural address, he promised concrete results and appealed for a "new national pride" and a rediscovery of American patriotism. He rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while "the people did not share" in Washington's wealth. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down. He promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. The address was heavy on populist themes, with Trump saying "the time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action." Despite protests and disruptions, the transfer of power was peaceful, with prominent Democrats and past presidents in attendance. Trump's presidency marks a remarkable journey from political outsider to the most powerful man in the country.
