SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana due to a new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said Washington stands for equality. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law. Indiana-based companies have also expressed concerns, and Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued." However, Pence and legislative leaders say they will seek to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination. The law has sparked national backlash, with critics warning it provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals.
