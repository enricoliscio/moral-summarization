Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about Washington Governor Jay Inslee announcing a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a new law there. The law allows businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons. Inslee finds the law disturbing and mentions a local florist who was fined for discrimination. He's inviting businesses to Washington instead.

Other states and cities like Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle are also banning travel to Indiana. Business leaders are against the law too; Tim Cook called it dangerous, and Marc Benioff canceled events there. Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, defends the law, saying it's been misunderstood and doesn't legalize discrimination. They plan to clarify the law.

So, the summary should cover Inslee's action, the reactions from other states and businesses, Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law. I'll keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.
