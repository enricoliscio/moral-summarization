SUMMARY: 
In response to Indiana's new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals based on religious beliefs, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to the state. Inslee finds the law disturbing and believes it goes against civil rights and equality for everyone. He joins other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in opposing the law and taking a stand against discrimination. The law has been condemned by business leaders such as Tim Cook and Marc Benioff, who called it "dangerous" and a license to discriminate. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has defended the law, stating that it has been misconstrued and that he abhors discrimination. However, Indiana's legislative leaders have acknowledged the need for a fix to ensure that the law does not protect discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
