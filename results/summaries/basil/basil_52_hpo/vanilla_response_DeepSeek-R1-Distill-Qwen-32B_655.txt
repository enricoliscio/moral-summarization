Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law there. The law allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee is upset because more states are supporting civil rights, and he wants to stand against this law. He also mentions a florist in Washington who was fined for discrimination. 

Other states and cities like Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have taken similar actions, banning travel funded by their states. Business leaders are also against the law; Tim Cook called it dangerous, and Marc Benioff canceled events in Indiana. Some Indiana companies are worried about the law's impact on their employees and state reputation. 

Indiana's Governor Mike Pence defends the law, saying it's been misunderstood and that it doesn't legalize discrimination. He says he opposes discrimination and that the law mirrors a federal one from 1993. The state senate president says they'll clarify the law to prevent discrimination.

So, the main points are: Washington and others banning travel to Indiana over the new law, business opposition, Pence's defense, and plans to clarify the law. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should include key actors, actions, and reactions. Make sure it's concise but covers all important aspects without going into too much detail.
