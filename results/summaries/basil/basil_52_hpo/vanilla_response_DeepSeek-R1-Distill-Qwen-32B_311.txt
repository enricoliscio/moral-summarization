Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law. The article mentions that the law allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee finds this law disturbing and is joining other states in opposing it. He also mentions a florist in Washington who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. 

I should note that other states and cities, like Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, have taken similar actions. Business leaders, including Tim Cook and Marc Benioff, are also speaking out against the law. There's a letter from nine Indiana-based companies expressing concerns about the law's impact. 

Indiana's Governor Mike Pence defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued and doesn't legalize discrimination. He and legislative leaders plan to clarify the law to prevent discrimination. 

So, the summary should include the main points: Inslee's ban, the controversial law, opposition from other states and businesses, Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all key aspects without getting too detailed.
