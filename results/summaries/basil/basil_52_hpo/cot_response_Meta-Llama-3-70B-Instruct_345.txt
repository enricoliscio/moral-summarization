SUMMARY:
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act as "disturbing" and a threat to "equality". The law, signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, has sparked national backlash, with critics warning it provides legal justification for "discrimination" against LGBT individuals. Inslee stated that Washington "stands for equality" and is "open to all people". Other cities and states, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, have also imposed travel bans. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and expressing "concern" for its impact on employees and the state's reputation. Governor Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote "discrimination". END OF SUMMARY.
