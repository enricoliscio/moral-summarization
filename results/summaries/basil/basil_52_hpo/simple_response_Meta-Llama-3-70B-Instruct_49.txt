SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new law allowing businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized Washington's commitment to equality, citing a recent case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has taken a similar stance, and cities like San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed travel bans. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, with some canceling events in Indiana. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote discrimination. However, Pence and legislative leaders have agreed to clarify the law to ensure it does not protect discrimination. The moral imperative is clear: equality and opportunity for all individuals must be upheld, and discrimination has no place in a just society.
