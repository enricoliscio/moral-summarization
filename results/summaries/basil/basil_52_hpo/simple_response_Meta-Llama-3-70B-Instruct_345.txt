SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized Washington's commitment to equality, citing a recent case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law, which has sparked national backlash. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana, and business leaders such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law. Despite Indiana Governor Mike Pence's defense of the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued," many argue that it provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals.

END OF SUMMARY.
