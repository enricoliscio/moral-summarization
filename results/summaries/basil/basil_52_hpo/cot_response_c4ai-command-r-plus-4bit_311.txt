SUMMARY: 
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana in response to its recent enactment of a law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. Inslee finds the law "disturbing," emphasizing Washington's stance on "equality" and "civil rights for everyone." He joins other states and cities, such as Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in *opposing* the law, citing a recent case where a florist from Washington was fined for *discriminating* against a gay couple. Indiana's Governor, Mike Pence, has *defended* his decision, arguing that the law has been *grossly* misconstrued and that he *abhors discrimination*. However, business leaders like Tim Cook and Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law, and Indiana-based companies have expressed their *concerns* about its impact on employees and the state's reputation. Some lawmakers in Indiana are now seeking to clarify that the law does not protect *discrimination*.
END OF SUMMARY.
