SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals based on religious beliefs. This decision follows similar actions taken by Connecticut and the cities of San Francisco and Seattle, as well as criticism from business leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. Indiana's Governor Mike Pence has defended his decision to sign the bill, claiming that it has been misinterpreted and does not reference sexual orientation. However, Indiana lawmakers plan to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination. The controversy has sparked a national debate about the balance between religious freedom and LGBT rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
