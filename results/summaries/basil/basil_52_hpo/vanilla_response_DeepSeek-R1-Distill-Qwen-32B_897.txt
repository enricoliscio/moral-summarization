Okay, I need to summarize this article about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law allowing businesses to discriminate against gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. The article mentions other states and cities taking similar actions, like Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle. It also talks about business leaders opposing the law, including Tim Cook and Marc Benioff. Indiana's Governor Mike Pence defends the law, saying it's been misunderstood, and they plan to clarify it. I should include all these points concisely, making sure the summary is under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating Inslee's action, then mention other states and businesses opposing the law, and finally Pence's defense and their plan to fix the law. Keeping it clear and to the point.
