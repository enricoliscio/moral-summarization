SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has imposed a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new law that allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons as "disturbing". Inslee stands for "equality" and opposes the law, which provides "justification" for discrimination against LGBT individuals. He invites companies and organizations that promote equality to come to Washington, which is "open for business" and "open to all people". Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has taken a similar stand, and cities like San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and expressing concerns about its impact on employees and the state's reputation. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "misconstrued" as a "license to discriminate", but has agreed to seek clarification to ensure it does not protect discrimination.
