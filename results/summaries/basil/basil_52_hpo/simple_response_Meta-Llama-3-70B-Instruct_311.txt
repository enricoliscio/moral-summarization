SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new law allowing businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized Washington's commitment to equality, citing a recent case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana, and business leaders such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote discrimination. However, critics argue that the law provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals. The controversy highlights the ongoing struggle for equality and human rights in the United States.
