SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it goes against the principles of equality and civil rights. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Many business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and harmful to the state's reputation. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not legalize discrimination. However, he and legislative leaders have agreed to seek clarification that the law does not protect discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
