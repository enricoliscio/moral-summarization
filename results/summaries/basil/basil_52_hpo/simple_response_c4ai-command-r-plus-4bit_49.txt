SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy have announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law, signed by Gov. Mike Pence, has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals on the basis of religious freedom. Several cities, states, and business leaders have joined the boycott, including San Francisco, Seattle, and prominent companies such as Apple and Salesforce. While Pence has defended his decision, claiming the law is not a "license to discriminate," he and other legislative leaders have agreed to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination. Inslee and Malloy's actions send a strong message that their states stand for equality and oppose any form of discrimination, inviting businesses and individuals who share these values to consider their states as inclusive and welcoming places to live and work. END OF SUMMARY.
