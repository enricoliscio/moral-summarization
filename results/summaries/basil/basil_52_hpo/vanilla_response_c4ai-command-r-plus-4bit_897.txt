SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals on religious grounds. Inslee joins other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in opposing the law, citing concerns for equality and civil rights. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been misconstrued and does not reference sexual orientation. However, the law has sparked a national backlash, with business leaders and mayors of major cities also speaking out against it. Executives from nine Indiana-based companies have expressed their concerns to Pence, and there are plans to clarify the law to ensure it does not protect discrimination. The move by Inslee and others sends a clear message of support for LGBT rights and opposition to any form of discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
