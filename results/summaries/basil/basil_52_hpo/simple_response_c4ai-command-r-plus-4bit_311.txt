SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has taken a moral stand against Indiana's controversial new law, which could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals on religious grounds. Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, joining other states and cities such as Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle in opposing the law. He emphasized Washington's commitment to equality and invited organizations to consider his state, which is "open to all people." Inslee's statement cited a case where a florist was fined for discriminating against a gay couple, highlighting the moral issue at stake. The law has sparked a national backlash, with business leaders and Indiana-based companies expressing concerns about its impact on employees and the state's reputation. Despite Gov. Pence's defense of the law, claiming it has been "misconstrued," there are plans to clarify that it does not condone discrimination. This story demonstrates a broader ethical debate surrounding equality and religious freedom, with Inslee and others choosing to prioritize protection against discrimination.
