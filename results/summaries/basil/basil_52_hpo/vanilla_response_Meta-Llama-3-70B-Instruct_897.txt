SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said Washington will join other states and cities in opposing it. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. San Francisco, Seattle, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Several business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" as a "license to discriminate." However, he and legislative leaders say they will seek to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
