SUMMARY: 
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the recent passing of a controversial law. The law, known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. Governor Inslee finds the law disturbing and believes it goes against the progress being made towards civil rights for everyone. He pledges to stand for equality and invites organizations to come to Washington, which is open to all. Other states and cities, such as Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, have joined in opposing the law, with similar travel bans and condemnations. Several business leaders have also spoken out, with some canceling events in Indiana. The law has been defended by Governor Mike Pence, who signed it, but he and other legislative leaders are now seeking to clarify that it does not condone discrimination. This move comes amid concerns that the law provides legal grounds for discrimination against the LGBT community. END OF SUMMARY.
