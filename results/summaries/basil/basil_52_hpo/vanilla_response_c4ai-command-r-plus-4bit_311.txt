SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs. Inslee joins other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in opposing the law. Business leaders have also spoken out against the law, with Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff expressing their concerns. Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who signed the bill into law, has defended his decision, stating that the law has been misinterpreted and does not condone discrimination. However, Indiana's legislative leaders plan to clarify the law to ensure it does not protect discrimination. The backlash against the law highlights the ongoing debate over balancing religious freedom and LGBT rights in the United States.
