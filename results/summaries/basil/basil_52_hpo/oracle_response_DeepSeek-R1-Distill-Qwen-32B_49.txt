Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about Washington Governor Jay Inslee announcing a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a new law that allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. He finds the law disturbing and mentions that more states are embracing civil rights. He also references a florist in Washington who was fined for discrimination. 

Other states like Connecticut and cities like San Francisco and Seattle have taken similar actions. Business leaders, including Tim Cook and Marc Benioff, have criticized the law, with some canceling events in Indiana. The Indiana governor, Mike Pence, defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued as a license to discriminate, and they aim to clarify it doesn't allow discrimination.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided. The user wants as many of these words as possible in the summary. Words like deny, disturb, opposing, ban, discriminating, equality, promotes, open, dangerous, abhor, refuse, fix.

I'll structure the summary to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll mention Inslee's actions, the florist case, other states' reactions, business responses, and Pence's defense. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all key points with the required vocabulary. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, opposing a controversial law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized Washington's commitment to equality, citing a local florist fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have also imposed bans on travel to Indiana, while business leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff have criticized the law as "dangerous." Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the law, claiming it was "grossly misconstrued" as a "license to discriminate," but acknowledged concerns and vowed to clarify it. Pence stated he abhors discrimination and would veto any bill legalizing it. However, critics argue the law provides justification for discrimination, and some Indiana companies have expressed concerns about its impact on the state's reputation. Inslee invited businesses to choose Washington, promoting it as a state open to all. END OF SUMMARY.
