SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has taken a moral stand against Indiana's controversial new law, which could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals on religious grounds. Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, joining other states and cities in opposing the law. He emphasized Washington's commitment to equality and invited businesses and individuals who value inclusivity to consider relocating to his state. This action mirrors similar measures taken by Connecticut, San Francisco, Seattle, and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The move sends a powerful message against discrimination and showcases Inslee's commitment to ensuring equal rights for all. The Indiana law has faced widespread backlash from business leaders and other prominent figures, who view it as a dangerous step backward in the fight for LGBT rights. Despite Gov. Pence's defense of the law, citing the protection of religious freedom, there is a growing consensus that such laws provide a license to discriminate. Leaders in Indiana are now working on clarifying the law to ensure it cannot be used to justify discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
