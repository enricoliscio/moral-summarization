SUMMARY:
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act as "disturbing" and a threat to "equality" and "civil rights". Inslee joins Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy and several cities in opposing the law, which critics argue provides legal justification for "discrimination" against LGBT individuals. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have also spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and expressing "concern" for its impact on employees and the state's "reputation". Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "misconstrued" and does not promote "discrimination". However, he and legislative leaders have pledged to "clarify" the law to ensure it does not "discriminate" against anyone. END OF SUMMARY.
