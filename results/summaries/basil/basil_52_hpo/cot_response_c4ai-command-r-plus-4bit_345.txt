SUMMARY:
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington announced Monday that he would ban state-funded travel to Indiana, where a new law could allow businesses to discriminate against gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. Inslee finds Indiana's law *disturbing*, especially at a time when many states and people are embracing *civil* rights for everyone. He pledges to *oppose* this law and joins other states and cities in *discriminating* against Indiana with travel bans. Inslee highlights Washington's stance for *equality* and invites organizations to visit his state, which is "open to all people." Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul also *condemn* the measure. Several business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, speak out against the law, with some canceling events and operations in Indiana. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who signed the bill, defends his decision, claiming the law is being *misconstrued* as a "license to discriminate." He asserts his opposition to discrimination and promises to seek a *fix* to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination.
