SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals on religious grounds. Inslee joins other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in opposing the law, citing concerns for equality and civil rights. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, stating that it has been misconstrued and does not reference sexual orientation. However, business leaders and politicians across the country have spoken out against the law, with some canceling events and expressing concerns about discrimination. Executives from nine Indiana-based companies have also voiced their opposition to the law, urging Pence to address the issue. Indiana's legislative leaders plan to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination. This action by Governor Inslee and others highlights the ongoing debate over LGBT rights and the balance between religious freedom and equality.
