SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new law allowing businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized that Washington stands for equality, citing a recent case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana, and business leaders such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and that he abhors discrimination. However, critics argue that the law provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals. The moral framing of this issue is clear: equality and fairness for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, is a fundamental right that must be protected.
