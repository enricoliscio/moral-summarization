Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law that allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the stance taken by Inslee and others.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Inslee is banning travel because he finds the law disturbing, especially since more states are embracing civil rights. He mentions a florist case in Washington as an example. He also invites businesses to come to Washington instead. Other states and cities like Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have taken similar actions. Business leaders, including Tim Cook and Marc Benioff, are against the law. Pence defends the law, saying it's been misinterpreted, but there are plans to clarify it.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: Inslee's action, the moral opposition, the impact on businesses, Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective, highlighting the conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination.

I'll start by stating Inslee's decision and his reasoning. Then mention other states and business reactions. Include Pence's defense and the intention to fix the law. Make sure to capture the moral stance against discrimination and support for equality.

Let me check if I'm covering all points without going over the word limit. I'll need to be concise but include all key aspects. Also, ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Inslee's action, then others' reactions, Pence's defense, and the clarification effort.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within 200 words and captures the moral framing as required.
