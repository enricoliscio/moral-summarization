SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it goes against Washington's values of equality and opportunity. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, with some canceling planned events in the state. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote discrimination. However, he and legislative leaders plan to clarify the law to ensure it does not protect discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
