SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana in response to a controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. Inslee finds the law disturbing and believes it promotes discrimination, a stance echoed by other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle. The law has sparked widespread backlash, with many business leaders speaking out against it, citing its potential impact on employees and the state's reputation. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been misconstrued and does not reference sexual orientation. However, critics argue it provides legal justification for discrimination. The Indiana Senate President Pro Tem has stated that the law will not be allowed to discriminate and that a fix is in the works. This issue highlights the ongoing struggle between those who embrace equality and those who oppose it, with many taking a stand against discrimination and in support of open and inclusive societies.
