SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy have taken a stand against the recent controversial law in Indiana that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. He emphasized Washington's commitment to equality and invited organizations to do business in a state that promotes equal opportunities for all. This action follows similar moves by San Francisco, Seattle, and the mayors of Minnesota's Twin Cities, who have also opposed the law. Business leaders, such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, with Cook calling it "dangerous." Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, defended his decision to sign the bill, arguing that it has been misconstrued and does not reference sexual orientation. However, he faces opposition from within his own state, with several Indiana-based companies expressing concerns about the law's impact on their employees and the state's reputation. Legislative leaders plan to clarify that the law will not be allowed to discriminate. END OF SUMMARY.
