Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law that allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. 

First, I should identify the key points. Inslee is opposing the law, citing it as disturbing and against civil rights. He mentions a florist in Washington who was fined for discrimination. He's inviting businesses to Washington instead. Other states and cities like Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle are also taking similar actions. Business leaders are speaking out, with Tim Cook and Marc Benioff opposing the law. Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued and that it mirrors federal law. They plan to clarify the law to prevent discrimination.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance against discrimination and the actions taken by various states and businesses. It's important to include both the criticism and the defense of the law to present a balanced view while highlighting the moral issues involved.

I should structure the summary to start with Inslee's action, mention other states and businesses opposing, then Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and making sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. Also, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.
