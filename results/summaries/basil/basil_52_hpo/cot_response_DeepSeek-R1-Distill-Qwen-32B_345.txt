Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial law. The task is to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral connotation, like "ban," "discriminate," "equality," etc. They reflect the author's judgment or stance on the issue.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that have a moral charge. Words like "ban," "controversial," "disturbing," "embrace," "oppose," "discriminate," "equality," "opportunity," "condemned," "backlash," "dangerous," "cancel," "concerns," "abhor," "Golden Rule," "discrimination," "fix," "intent," "discriminate," "hope," "equality," "opportunity," "open," "discriminate," "ban," "backlash," "discriminate," "equality," "opportunity," "open."

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the moral arguments presented.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Inslee's ban, the reason behind it, the reaction from other states and businesses, Pence's defense, and the ongoing efforts to clarify the law. I'll weave in the moral words to reflect the author's framing.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the moral perspectives of both sides. I'll also keep an eye on the word count to stay within the limit.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to include all the key points, using the identified moral words to maintain the original framing. This way, the summary will effectively convey the moral stance of the article while being concise.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial law allowing businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized Washington's commitment to equality, citing a local florist fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut, San Francisco, Seattle, and Minnesota's Twin Cities have also condemned the law, imposing similar bans. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, criticized the law as "dangerous" and canceled events in Indiana. Meanwhile, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the law, claiming it was "grossly misconstrued" and does not legalize discrimination. State leaders pledged to clarify the law to prevent discrimination. Inslee invited businesses to expand in Washington, highlighting its openness and commitment to equality and opportunity. END OF SUMMARY.
