SUMMARY:
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act as "disturbing" and a threat to "equality". Inslee joins Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy and several cities in opposing the law, which critics argue provides legal justification for "discrimination" against LGBT individuals. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have also spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and harmful to Indiana's reputation. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote "discrimination". However, Pence and legislative leaders have pledged to clarify the law to ensure it does not protect "discrimination". END OF SUMMARY.
