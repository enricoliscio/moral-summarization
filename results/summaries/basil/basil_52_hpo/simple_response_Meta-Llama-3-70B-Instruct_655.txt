SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and emphasized that Washington stands for equality, citing a recent case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana, and business leaders such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law. While Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued," many critics argue that it provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals.
