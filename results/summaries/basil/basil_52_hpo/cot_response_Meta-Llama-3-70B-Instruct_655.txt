SUMMARY:
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act as "disturbing" and a threat to "civil rights" and "equality". The law, signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, has sparked national backlash, with critics warning it provides legal justification for "discrimination" against LGBT individuals. Inslee joins Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy and several cities in opposing the law, which has also been condemned by business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, who called it "dangerous". Indiana-based companies have expressed "concern" over the law's impact on their employees and the state's "reputation". Governor Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote "discrimination". However, he and legislative leaders plan to "clarify" the law to ensure it does not protect "discrimination". END OF SUMMARY.
