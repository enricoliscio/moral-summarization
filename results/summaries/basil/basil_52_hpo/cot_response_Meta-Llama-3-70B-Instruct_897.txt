SUMMARY:
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act as "disturbing" and a threat to "equality". Inslee argues that the law could allow businesses to "discriminate" against gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons, contradicting Washington's values of "equality" and "opportunity". Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has taken a similar stance, and cities like San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed travel bans. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and harmful to Indiana's reputation. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote "discrimination". However, he and legislative leaders have agreed to "clarify" the law to ensure it does not protect "discrimination". END OF SUMMARY.
