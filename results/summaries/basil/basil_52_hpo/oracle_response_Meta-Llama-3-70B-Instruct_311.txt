SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons as "disturbing". Inslee stands for equality and opposes the law, which he believes provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals. He invites companies and organizations that share his values to come to Washington, a state that promotes equality and opportunity. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has taken a similar stand, and cities like San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and harmful to the state's reputation. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been misconstrued, but has agreed to seek clarification to ensure it does not protect discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
