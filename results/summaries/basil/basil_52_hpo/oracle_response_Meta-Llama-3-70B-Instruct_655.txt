SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee finds the law "disturbing" and believes it goes against the principles of equality and civil rights. He joins other states and cities, including Connecticut and San Francisco, in opposing the law. Inslee's decision comes after a Washington-based florist was ordered to pay a fine for discriminating against a gay couple. The governor emphasizes that Washington "stands for equality" and is "open to all people." The backlash against Indiana's law has been widespread, with business leaders like Apple's Tim Cook calling it "dangerous" and Salesforce's Marc Benioff canceling events in the state. Even Indiana-based companies have spoken out against the law, expressing concerns about its impact on employees and the state's reputation. Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, but critics argue it provides legal justification for discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
