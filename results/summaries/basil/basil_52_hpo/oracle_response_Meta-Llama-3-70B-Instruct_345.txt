SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons as "disturbing". Inslee stands for "equality" and opposes the law, which provides "justification" for discrimination against LGBT individuals. The ban is a moral stance against discrimination, echoing the sentiments of Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy, who also imposed a similar ban. Cities like San Francisco and Seattle, as well as business leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have also spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and citing its negative "impact" on employees and the state's reputation. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "misconstrued" as a "license to discriminate", but critics argue it allows businesses to "refuse" service to LGBT individuals. The controversy has sparked a national backlash, with many calling for a "fix" to the law to ensure it does not promote discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
