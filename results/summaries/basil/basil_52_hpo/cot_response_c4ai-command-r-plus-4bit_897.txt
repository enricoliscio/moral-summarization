SUMMARY:
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana following the passage of a controversial law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. Inslee finds the law *disturbing* and believes it goes against the trend of states and people embracing *equality*. He joins other states and cities, such as Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in *opposing* the law, citing it as discriminatory. The law has sparked a national backlash, with business leaders like Tim Cook and Marc Benioff speaking out against it, calling it *dangerous* and expressing their *concerns*. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, arguing that it has been *grossly misconstrued* as a *license* to *discriminate*. However, he states that he *abhors* *discrimination*. Legislative leaders plan to clarify that it is not the *intent* of the law to discriminate and that it will not be *allowed* to be used in that way.
END OF SUMMARY.
