SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said Washington stands for equality. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has also taken a similar stand against the law. San Francisco, Seattle, and the Twin Cities have imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana, and several business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming it has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not promote discrimination. However, he and legislative leaders plan to clarify the law to ensure it does not protect discrimination. The backlash against the law has sparked a national debate on civil rights and discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
