SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana following the enactment of a law that could allow businesses to deny services to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. The move comes as a stand against what Inslee describes as a "disturbing" law, with the governor emphasizing Washington's commitment to equality and opposition to discrimination. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy has taken a similar stance, along with the cities of San Francisco and Seattle, which have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to Indiana. Business leaders, such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, with Cook calling it "dangerous." In contrast, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who signed the bill, has defended his decision, stating that the law has been "grossly misconstrued" and does not aim to discriminate. However, Indiana lawmakers are now seeking to clarify the law to ensure it does not permit discrimination. The case highlights the ongoing debate between religious freedom and LGBT rights, with states and cities taking a stand against what they perceive as a potential license to discriminate.
