SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy have taken a stand against Indiana's new "Religious Freedom Restoration Act," which allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Gov. Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the case of a florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. He emphasized Washington's commitment to equality and invited organizations to do business in a state that promotes equal opportunities for all. Gov. Malloy also opposed the law, joining other states and cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and the mayors of Minnesota's Twin Cities in condemning the measure. Business leaders, such as Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have spoken out against the law, with some canceling events and plans to expand operations in Indiana. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has defended his decision, stating that the law has been misconstrued and that he abhors discrimination. However, he and other legislative leaders plan to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
