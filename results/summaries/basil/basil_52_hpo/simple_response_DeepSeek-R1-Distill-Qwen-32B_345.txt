Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary needs to capture the ethical implications as presented by the author.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Washington's governor banned state-funded travel to Indiana due to a new law allowing businesses to discriminate based on religious reasons. Other states and cities, like Connecticut and San Francisco, are taking similar actions. Business leaders are also opposing the law, while Indiana's governor defends it, saying it's been misunderstood.

I should highlight the moral arguments from both sides. Inslee's stance is about equality and opposing discrimination, which is a strong moral position. On the other hand, Pence claims the law isn't about discrimination and references federal law, which is his moral justification.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral framing without adding my own opinions. I'll structure it by mentioning the ban, the reasoning behind it, the support from other states and businesses, Pence's defense, and the ongoing debate.

Let me start drafting: Begin with Inslee's action, his reasoning, mention other states and cities, business opposition, Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law. Make sure to include key quotes to emphasize the moral points.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, moving from the action to the reactions and defenses.

Now, putting it all together while keeping an eye on the word count. I'll make sure each sentence adds value and sticks to the main points without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll check that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed. Also, ensure it's within 200 words.

SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial law allowing businesses to deny service to LGBTQ+ individuals for religious reasons. Inslee criticized the law, calling it a step backward in civil rights, and highlighted Washington's commitment to equality. Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have also imposed similar bans, while business leaders like Tim Cook and Marc Benioff have condemned the law. Indiana Governor Mike Pence defended the law, stating it was "grossly misconstrued" and does not legalize discrimination. State leaders aim to clarify the law to prevent discrimination. The debate highlights tensions between religious freedom and anti-discrimination protections. END OF SUMMARY.
