SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has taken a moral stand against Indiana's controversial new law, which could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals on religious grounds. Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, sending a clear message of support for equality and opposition to discrimination. He cited the case of a Washington florist who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple, emphasizing Washington's commitment to civil rights for all. Inslee invited organizations seeking a state that promotes equality to come to Washington, highlighting the state's inclusive business environment. Other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, have joined the boycott, and business leaders like Tim Cook and Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law. Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, defended the law, arguing that it has been misunderstood and does not condone discrimination. However, Indiana lawmakers have acknowledged the need for clarification to ensure the law does not enable discrimination.
