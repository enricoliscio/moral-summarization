SUMMARY:

Washington Governor Jay Inslee has imposed a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act as "disturbing" and a threat to "equality" for LGBT individuals. Inslee's decision comes after Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed the law, which critics argue provides legal "justification" for businesses to "discriminate" against gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee joins Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy and several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, in "opposing" the law and promoting "equality" and "openness" to all individuals. Business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have also spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous" and harmful to Indiana's reputation. Meanwhile, Pence defends the law, claiming it has been "misconstrued" as a "license to discriminate," and vows to seek a "fix" to clarify its intent. END OF SUMMARY.
