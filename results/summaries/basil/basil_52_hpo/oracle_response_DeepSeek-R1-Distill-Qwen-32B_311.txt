Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Washington Governor Jay Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana because of a controversial law. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the key points. Inslee is opposing Indiana's law that could allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons. He finds it disturbing and mentions a florist case in Washington. He's inviting businesses to come to Washington instead. Other states and cities are taking similar actions, and there's backlash from businesses like Apple and Salesforce. Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued and doesn't legalize discrimination, but there are plans to clarify it.

Now, I need to extract the main points and use as many of the provided moral words as possible. Words like deny, ban, disturbing, oppose, impose, equality, discrimination, dangerous, license, etc. I should structure the summary to include these words naturally.

I'll start by mentioning Inslee's ban and his reasons, then note the national backlash and business reactions, and finally Pence's defense and the intention to clarify the law. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the moral framing words.

Let me draft it: Inslee announces ban, finds law disturbing, opposes it, mentions the florist case, stands for equality, invites businesses. Other states and cities impose bans. Businesses speak out, call it dangerous. Pence defends, says it's misconstrued, not a license to discriminate. They plan to fix it.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit.

Inslee called the law "disturbing," emphasizing that Washington stands for equality and opposes discrimination. He cited a case of a Washington florist fined for discriminating against a gay couple, highlighting the state's commitment to civil rights. Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have also imposed travel bans, while business leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff have criticized the law as "dangerous." Indiana Gov.
