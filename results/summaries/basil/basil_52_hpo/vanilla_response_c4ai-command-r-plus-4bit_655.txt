SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial new law that could allow businesses to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs. Inslee joins other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in opposing the law. The measure has sparked a national backlash, with business leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff also speaking out against it. Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who signed the bill into law, defended his decision, stating that the law has been misconstrued and does not promote discrimination. However, Indiana state leaders plan to clarify the law to ensure it does not allow for discrimination. 
END OF SUMMARY.
