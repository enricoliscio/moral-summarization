Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a concise summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "ban," "discriminate," "equality," "opportunity," "backlash," "concerns," "condemned," "abhor," "Golden Rule," "fix," "intend," "license," "discriminate," and "opportunity." These words seem to carry the moral weight in the text.

Now, for the summary, I need to make sure I include as many of these words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The main points are Washington and Connecticut banning travel to Indiana due to the new law allowing discrimination based on religion. Businesses are opposing the law, and Indiana's governor is defending it, saying it's been misunderstood. The summary should highlight the moral stance against discrimination and the actions taken by other states and businesses.

I should structure the summary to include the governors' actions, the business responses, and the defense from Indiana's governor. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the framing. Let me piece it together concisely.

**STEP 1:**  
* Ban  
* Discriminate  
* Equality  
* Opportunity  
* Backlash  
* Concerns  
* Condemned  
* Abhor  
* Golden Rule  
* Fix  
* Intend  
* License  
* Discriminate  
* Opportunity  

**SUMMARY:**  
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial law allowing businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee criticized the law, calling it "disturbing" and emphasizing Washington's commitment to equality. Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have also imposed travel bans, while business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, have condemned the law. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the law, claiming it was "grossly misconstrued" and does not legalize discrimination. However, state leaders acknowledge the need to clarify the law to prevent discrimination. The backlash highlights a moral divide over equality and opportunity, with critics warning the law could license discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
