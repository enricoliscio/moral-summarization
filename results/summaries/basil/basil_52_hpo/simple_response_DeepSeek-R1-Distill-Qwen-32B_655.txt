Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law allowing businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons. He finds the law disturbing, especially since more states are embracing civil rights. He mentioned a florist in Washington who was fined for discriminating against a gay couple. Inslee is inviting businesses to come to Washington instead.

Connecticut's governor and cities like San Francisco and Seattle have taken similar actions. Business leaders, including Tim Cook and Marc Benioff, are against the law. Some Indiana companies are also concerned about the law's impact on their employees and state reputation.

Indiana Governor Mike Pence defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued and that he opposes discrimination. He claims the law mirrors a federal one signed by Clinton and doesn't mention sexual orientation. They plan to clarify the law to prevent discrimination.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral aspects. The key moral points are the opposition to discrimination, support for equality, and the stance of various leaders and businesses. I should include Inslee's actions, the reactions from other states and businesses, Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the law and equality, the actions taken by other states and businesses, and the response from Indiana's leaders. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll start with Inslee's announcement, mention the florist case, other states' actions, business reactions, Pence's defense, and the intent to clarify the law. That should cover the main points and preserve the moral perspective.
