SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee has banned state-funded travel to Indiana following the passing of a controversial law that could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. The law has sparked a national backlash, with critics arguing that it provides legal justification for discrimination against the LGBT community. Governor Inslee joins other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in opposing the law and taking a stand for equality. The move sends a clear message that Washington embraces civil rights for everyone and will not tolerate discrimination. Businesses leaders have also spoken out against the law, with Apple's Tim Cook calling it "dangerous." Indiana Governor Mike Pence has defended the law, claiming that it has been "grossly misconstrued," and that he abhors discrimination. However, faced with mounting pressure, Governor Pence and legislative leaders have agreed to clarify that the law will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone.
