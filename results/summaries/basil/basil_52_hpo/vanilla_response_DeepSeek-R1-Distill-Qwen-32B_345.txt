Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to get the main points. The article is about Washington Governor Jay Inslee announcing a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law there. The law allows businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. Inslee finds this law disturbing, especially since many states are moving towards embracing civil rights for everyone. He mentions a Washington florist who was fined for discrimination against a gay couple, showing his stance against such actions. He also invites businesses and organizations that value equality to come to Washington instead.

Then, the article mentions that Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy also took a similar stand. Other cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and the Twin Cities in Minnesota have banned city-funded travel to Indiana. Business leaders are speaking out too; Tim Cook from Apple called the law dangerous, and Marc Benioff from Salesforce canceled events there. Nine Indiana companies sent a letter to Governor Pence expressing concerns about the law's impact on their employees and the state's reputation.

Pence defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued as a license to discriminate. He claims it's about religious freedom and not about discrimination, and that it mirrors federal law. However, he and legislative leaders plan to clarify the law to ensure it doesn't allow discrimination.

So, the main points are:
1. Inslee bans state-funded travel to Indiana due to the new law.
2. The law allows discrimination for religious reasons, sparking backlash.
3. Other states and cities are imposing similar bans.
4. Business leaders are opposing the law.
5. Pence defends the law, saying it's about religious freedom and not discrimination, and plans to clarify it.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Inslee's announcement, mention the law's purpose, the backlash, other states' actions, business opposition, Pence's defense, and the plan to clarify the law. I should make sure each point is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details.
