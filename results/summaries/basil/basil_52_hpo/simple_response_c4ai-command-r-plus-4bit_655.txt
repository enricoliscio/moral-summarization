SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has taken a moral stand against Indiana's controversial new law, which could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals in the name of religious freedom. Inslee's decision to ban state-funded travel to Indiana sends a clear message of support for equality and opposition to discrimination. He is joined by other states and cities, including Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle, in taking a stand against this law. Business leaders have also voiced their concerns, with Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff speaking out. The intent of the law, according to Indiana's governor and legislative leaders, is not to discriminate, but to protect religious freedom. However, the potential for misuse and the message it sends are deeply concerning. Inslee's actions demonstrate a commitment to ensuring that Washington remains a state that promotes equality and welcomes all individuals, sending an invitation to businesses and individuals who share these values.
