Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

So, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana because of a new law that allows businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons. He finds the law disturbing and mentions a florist in Washington who was fined for discrimination. He's promoting equality and inviting businesses to come to Washington instead.

Connecticut and other cities like San Francisco and Seattle have taken similar actions. Business leaders, including Tim Cook and Marc Benioff, are against the law, calling it dangerous and pulling events from Indiana. Some Indiana companies are also concerned about the law's impact and reputation.

Indiana's Governor Pence defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued as a license to discriminate. He claims the law doesn't target discrimination and they'll seek to clarify it.

I need to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like deny, ban, disturbing, oppose, equality, discrimination, dangerous, etc. The summary should be concise, around 200 words.

I'll structure it by mentioning Inslee's action, the reaction from other states and businesses, Pence's defense, and the companies' concerns. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the framing.

Let me draft it: Start with Inslee's ban, his reasons, the florist example. Then mention other states and cities, business leaders' opposition. Include Pence's defense and the companies' letter. Keep it within the word limit and include all key points with the moral language.
