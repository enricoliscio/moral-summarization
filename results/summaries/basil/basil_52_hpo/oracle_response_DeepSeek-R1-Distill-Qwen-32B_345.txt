Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Washington Gov. Inslee banning state-funded travel to Indiana due to a new law that could allow discrimination against LGBTQ individuals for religious reasons. Other states and cities are also taking similar actions, and there's a backlash from businesses. Pence defends the law, saying it's been misconstrued, but there are efforts to clarify it.

I need to identify the morally charged words in the article: deny, law, disturbing, embracing, opposing, impose, ban, pay, discriminating, stand, equality, spoken, promotes, open, provides, justification, discrimination, dangerous, impact, misconstrued, license, discriminate, abhor, refuse, eat, legalized, veto, allowed, fix.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these words. I'll start with Inslee's decision, mention the law's controversy, include the florist case, and note the support from businesses. Then, I'll add the backlash and Pence's defense, ending with the efforts to fix the law.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. Let me draft this, making sure to include all key points and the specified words.

SUMMARY: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana due to a controversial law allowing businesses to deny service to LGBTQ individuals for religious reasons, calling it "disturbing." Inslee emphasized Washington's commitment to equality, referencing a florist who discriminated against a gay couple. Connecticut, San Francisco, and Seattle have also imposed bans, while business leaders like Tim Cook and Marc Benioff have spoken out against the law, calling it "dangerous." Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the law, claiming it was "grossly misconstrued" and does not legalize discrimination, though he acknowledged the need for clarification. Pence stated he would veto any bill legalizing discrimination. The law has sparked national backlash, with critics warning it provides justification for discrimination. Indiana-based companies have expressed concerns over its impact on the state's reputation. Efforts are underway to fix the law to ensure it does not allow discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
