SUMMARY: On Saturday in Ohio, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum described what he called the "phony theology" of President Obama's agenda, suggesting that it was not based on the Bible. This comment drew criticism from Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, who called it "destructive" and reflective of the "nastiness" of the Republican nominating process. Mr. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to the president's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Additionally, Mr. Santorum expressed his preference for locally run public education and parental involvement in designing educational environments for their children. He also defended his criticism of the president's health care policy, suggesting that it encouraged abortion for disabled children. Meanwhile, Mr. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, criticized him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that there were more pressing issues facing the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
