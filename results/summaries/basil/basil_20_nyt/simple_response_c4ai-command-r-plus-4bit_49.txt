SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has stirred controversy with his recent comments, accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" and suggesting that public education is anachronistic. Santorum clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship with the world, not his faith. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as destructive and over the line. Santorum also advocated for local control of education, with parents in charge, and defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, suggesting that it encourages abortions for disabled children. He faced backlash from rival Ron Paul, who scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that more pressing issues like civil liberties and national debt should take precedence. Santorum's comments reflect a moral framework that emphasizes traditional values, parental responsibility, and religious faith, but they have also drawn criticism for their divisive nature and potential distortion of the president's views.
END OF SUMMARY.
