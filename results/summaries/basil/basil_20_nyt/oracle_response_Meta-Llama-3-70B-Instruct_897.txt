SUMMARY: 

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong" and "destructive," saying they reflected the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. 

Santorum also expressed his views on education, calling the idea of federal or state governments running schools "anachronistic." He believes parents should be "in charge" of their children's education, working with local school districts to design an optimal educational environment. 

Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of a requirement in Obama's health-care policy that insurance companies cover prenatal testing, suggesting that it could lead to more abortions and "cull[ing] the ranks of the disabled" in society. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at his focus on social issues, saying it was misguided and ignored more pressing concerns like civil liberties and debt.
