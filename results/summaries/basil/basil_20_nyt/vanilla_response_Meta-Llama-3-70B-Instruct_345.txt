SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his comment that President Obama subscribed to a "phony theology," saying he was referring to the president's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Santorum made the original comment during a campaign stop in Ohio, criticizing Obama's agenda as based on a "different theology" than the Bible. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, condemned the attack as "wrong" and "destructive." Santorum also expressed his views on education, calling the idea of federal or state governments running schools "anachronistic" and advocating for a more localized approach. He defended his criticism of a healthcare policy requiring insurance companies to cover prenatal testing, suggesting it was included to reduce abortions. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, saying it's unlikely he could defeat Obama.
