SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to the president's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong," "destructive," and reflective of the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his views on education, calling the idea of federal or state governments running schools "anachronistic" and emphasizing the importance of parental involvement. Additionally, he defended his criticism of the president's health-care policy, suggesting that it could lead to more abortions and a lack of care for the disabled. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception as unrealistic. END OF SUMMARY.
