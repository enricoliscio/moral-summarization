SUMMARY: Rick Santorum attempts to clarify his controversial statement accusing President Obama of espousing a "phony theology," attributing it to their differing views on man's relationship with the world. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticizes Santorum's remarks as divisive and destructive. Santorum also expresses his belief that public education should be locally run with parents in charge, and defends his criticism of Obama's health-care policy regarding prenatal testing and abortion. Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, dismisses Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that more pressing issues like civil liberties and national debt should take precedence.
