SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has caused controversy by accusing President Obama of following a "phony theology," claiming that Obama's agenda is based on a theology that is not rooted in the Bible. This statement has been criticized as an attack on Obama's character and faith, with Robert Gibbs describing it as "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness," and "destructive." Santorum has also sparked debate by calling public education an "anachronistic" idea and advocating for more local control and parental involvement in schools. He defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, suggesting that the president lacks sympathy for the disabled and has a poor record on abortion. Ron Paul, one of Santorum's rivals, has criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, while neglecting more pressing issues like civil liberties, wars, and the national debt.
