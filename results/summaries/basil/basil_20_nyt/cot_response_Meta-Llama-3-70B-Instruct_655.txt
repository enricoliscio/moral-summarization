SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's remarks as "wrong" and "destructive", reflecting the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. He also expressed his views on education, calling the idea of federal or state governments running schools "anachronistic" and emphasizing the importance of parental involvement. Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of a health-care policy requirement, suggesting that it could lead to more abortions and "cull the ranks of the disabled" in society. His rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception. END OF SUMMARY.
