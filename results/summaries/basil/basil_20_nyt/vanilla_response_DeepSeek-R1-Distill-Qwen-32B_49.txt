Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with Santorum clarifying his earlier statement about President Obama's "phony theology." He said it wasn't about Obama's faith but his view on man's relationship to the world. Then, Obama's adviser Robert Gibbs criticized this as crossing the line and being destructive. 

Next, Santorum talks about education, saying federal and state-run schools are outdated. He believes in local control and parental involvement, emphasizing that parents should be in charge of their children's education. He supports government help but not the current system of big public schools, likening them to factories.

He also criticized Obama's healthcare policy for requiring prenatal testing, suggesting it's to reduce costs by encouraging abortion, especially for disabled children. Santorum has a daughter with a chromosomal disorder, which he mentions as part of his argument.

Finally, his rival Ron Paul mocks him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception instead of more pressing issues like the economy and wars.

So, the key points are Santorum's clarification on theology, his education views, criticism of healthcare policy, and Paul's criticism. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include all main points without getting too detailed.
