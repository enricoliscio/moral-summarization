SUMMARY: Rick Santorum stirred controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology," claiming that Obama's views on man's relationship with the world are not based on the Bible. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as destructive and divisive. Santorum also criticized the idea of federal or state control over schools, advocating for local control and parental involvement in education. He defended his stance against Obama's health care policy, claiming it promotes abortion and undermines the rights of the disabled. Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, criticized Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that more pressing issues like civil liberties and national debt should take precedence. Santorum's comments highlight a moral debate in American politics, with Santorum advocating for traditional values and local control, while Obama's administration promotes a more centralized and secular approach.
