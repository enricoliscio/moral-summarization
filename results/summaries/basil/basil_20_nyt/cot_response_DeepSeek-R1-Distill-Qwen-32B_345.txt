Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words, then write a summary preserving those terms. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

First, Santorum called Obama's theology "phony." That's a strong moral statement. Then Gibbs criticized the attacks on Obama's character and faith, using words like "wrong" and "destructive." Santorum also talked about public education being "anachronistic," which might imply outdated or ineffective, but I'm not sure if that's moral. He emphasized parents' responsibility, so "responsible" is a moral term. He also mentioned the need for a "dynamic" process in education, which is more about effectiveness than morality.

On the health-care policy, Santorum said it's about "saving money" and "culling the ranks," which are negative moral implications. He criticized Obama's "bad record" on abortion and disabilities. Paul dismissed Santorum's focus on social issues as "worrying" about civil liberties and debt, which are moral concerns.

So, the morally framed words I identified are: phony, theology, wrong, destructive, nasty, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions, responsible, dynamic, saving, cull, bad, worried, civil liberties, debt.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning Santorum's clarification, Gibbs' criticism, Santorum's views on education, health policy, and Paul's dismissal.

I need to make sure each point is concise and includes the moral terms. Let me check the word count as I go. I'll start with Santorum's clarification, then Gibbs' reaction, move to education, then the health-care policy, and finally Paul's comments. That should cover all the points without exceeding the limit.

**SUMMARY:**

Rick Santorum recently clarified his controversial remark about President Obama's "phony theology," explaining it referred to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world rather than his faith. However, Obama's political adviser, Robert Gibbs, condemned such attacks as "wrong" and "destructive," calling them examples of the "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness" in the Republican nominating process. Santorum also criticized the federal and state governments' role in education, calling it "anachronistic," and emphasized the importance of parents being "responsible" for their children's education. He advocated for a "dynamic" local approach to schooling. Additionally, Santorum criticized Obama's health-care policy for promoting prenatal testing to "save money," suggesting it could lead to "culling" the disabled. He accused Obama of having a "bad record" on abortion and disability issues. Meanwhile, rival Ron Paul dismissed Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and birth control, expressing concern over "civil liberties" and the national "debt" instead. END OF SUMMARY.
