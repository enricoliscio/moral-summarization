Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral aspects involved.

The article is about Rick Santorum's comments during his campaign. He made a few controversial statements. First, he criticized President Obama's theology, which he later clarified was about Obama's view on man's relationship to the world, not his personal faith. Then, he talked about public education, arguing that it's outdated and should be more localized with parents in charge. He also criticized Obama's healthcare policy regarding prenatal testing, suggesting it leads to more abortions, which he linked to a lack of sympathy for the disabled. Additionally, his rival Ron Paul criticized him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception instead of more pressing economic and civil liberties issues.

I need to capture these points while highlighting the moral implications. Santorum's comments on theology and healthcare seem to be framed around moral and ethical issues, particularly regarding life, abortion, and government's role in education and healthcare. Ron Paul's criticism points to a different set of priorities, focusing on economic and civil liberties instead.

I should structure the summary to include Santorum's clarification on theology, his stance on education, his critique of healthcare policy, and Paul's response. Each point should reflect the moral framing without getting too bogged down in the details.

Let me make sure to stay under 200 words and keep it concise. I'll start by mentioning Santorum's clarification, then move to education, healthcare, and Paul's response. I'll end with the implications of the debate on social issues versus economic ones.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Also, I need to ensure that the summary accurately reflects the moral dimensions each point has. For example, when Santorum talks about theology, it's about the underlying beliefs driving policy, and his healthcare critique is about the moral implications of abortion.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing as per the user's request.
