SUMMARY: Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to the President's view of man's relationship to the world, rather than his faith. Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong" and "destructive", saying they reflected the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his views on education, stating that the idea of federal or state governments running schools is "anachronistic" and that parents should be in "charge" of their children's education. He defended his criticism of the President's health-care policy, saying it would lead to "culling the ranks of the disabled" and that the President has a "bad record" on abortion and children with disabilities. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at his focus on social issues, saying it was a distraction from more pressing concerns like civil liberties and debt. END OF SUMMARY.
