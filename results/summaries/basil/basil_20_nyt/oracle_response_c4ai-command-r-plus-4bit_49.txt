SUMMARY: Rick Santorum caused controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology," which he later clarified as referring to their differing views on man's relationship with the world. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as "destructive" and "over the line." Santorum also advocated for more local control in education and criticized Obama's health care policy, suggesting it encourages abortion for disabled children. He defended his stance on social issues like abortion and contraception, and his rival Ron Paul scoffed at his focus on these topics. Santorum's comments highlight a divisive approach to politics, with potential destructive consequences.
