Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral implications.

The article talks about Rick Santorum's comments during his campaign. He criticized Obama's "phony theology," which he later clarified was about Obama's view on man's relationship to the world, not his faith. However, Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum for attacking Obama's character and faith, calling it wrong and destructive. This sets up a moral issue of whether it's appropriate to criticize someone's faith in a political context.

Next, Santorum discusses education, arguing against federal and state-run schools, promoting local control and parental involvement. He uses the analogy of factory schools from industrialization, suggesting that the system hasn't evolved. This reflects a moral stance on education reform and the role of government versus parents.

Santorum also critiques Obama's healthcare policy, specifically the requirement for insurance companies to cover prenatal testing, linking it to abortion rates. He argues that this policy could lead to more abortions, especially for disabled children, which ties into his moral opposition to abortion and concern for the disabled. This raises questions about the ethics of healthcare policies and their societal impact.

Lastly, Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismisses Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, instead emphasizing economic and civil liberties. This highlights a moral debate within the Republican party about priorities: social issues versus economic and foreign policy concerns.

I need to capture these moral framings in the summary. Santorum's attacks on Obama's theology, his stance on education and parental responsibility, his critique of healthcare policies regarding abortion, and the intra-party debate on priorities are all key points. The summary should reflect the moral implications and the differing perspectives presented.

I should structure the summary to first address the theological critique, then move to education, healthcare, and the political rivalry. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure each point is concise but captures the moral aspects. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements while preserving the moral framing. I'll start with Santorum's clarification, then Gibbs' criticism, followed by his education views, healthcare critique, and Paul's dismissal. I'll end with the implication that Santorum's approach is polarizing the party.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and accurately reflects the moral perspectives presented in the article.

Santorum also argued against federal and state-run schools, advocating for local control and parental involvement, calling the current system "anachronistic." He emphasized that while government can help, education should be tailored to each child's potential. Santorum also criticized Obama's healthcare policy for promoting prenatal testing, linking it to abortion rates and suggesting it disfavors disabled children. He defended his stance, despite having a daughter with a chromosomal disorder.
