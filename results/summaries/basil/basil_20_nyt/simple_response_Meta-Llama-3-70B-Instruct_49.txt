SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong" and "destructive." Santorum also expressed his opposition to federal and state governments running schools, calling it "anachronistic" and advocating for a more localized approach to education. He defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, which requires insurance companies to cover prenatal testing, suggesting that it could lead to more abortions. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, prioritizing concerns about civil liberties, wars, and debt instead.
