SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his comment that President Obama subscribed to a "phony theology," saying he was referring to the president's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Santorum made the original comment during a campaign stop in Ohio, criticizing Obama's agenda as being based on a "different theology" than the Bible. Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to Obama, condemned the attack as "wrong" and "destructive." Santorum also expressed his views on education, saying that the idea of federal or state governments running schools is "anachronistic" and that parents should be in charge of their children's education. He defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, saying it would lead to more abortions. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, criticized him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, and doubted his ability to defeat Obama.
