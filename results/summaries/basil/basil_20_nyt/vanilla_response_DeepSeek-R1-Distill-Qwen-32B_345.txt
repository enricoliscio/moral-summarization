Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with Santorum clarifying his earlier comment about Obama's theology. He said it wasn't about Obama's faith but his view on man's relationship to the world. He called it "phony theology" that's not based on the Bible. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized this, calling it over the line and destructive.

Then, Santorum talks about education, saying federal and state-run schools are outdated. He supports local control and parents' role in education. He mentions home-schooling his kids and wants public education to be locally managed. He doesn't oppose government funding but thinks the system is outdated, like factory schools from industrialization times.

He also criticized Obama's healthcare policy for requiring prenatal testing, linking it to abortion rates and disability issues. He has a daughter with a chromosomal disorder and believes doctors push abortion in such cases. He accused Obama of a bad record on abortion and disabled children.

His rival, Ron Paul, disagrees, focusing on economic and civil liberties issues instead of social topics like birth control. Paul thinks Santorum's approach isn't effective against Obama.

So, the summary needs to cover Santorum's theology comment, education views, healthcare criticism, and Paul's response. Keep it under 200 words, concise, and clear.
