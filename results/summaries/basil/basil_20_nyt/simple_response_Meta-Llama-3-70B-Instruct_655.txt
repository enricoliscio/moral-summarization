SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that deviates from Biblical values. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of humanity's relationship with the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, condemned the attack as "wrong" and "destructive." Santorum also expressed his disapproval of federal and state government control over schools, advocating for local control and parental involvement. He defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting that it promotes abortions and neglects the disabled. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues, emphasizing the need to address civil liberties, wars, and debt.
