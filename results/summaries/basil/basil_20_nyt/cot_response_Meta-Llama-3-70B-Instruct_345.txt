SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong" and "destructive," saying they reflected the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his views on education, calling the idea of federal or state governments running schools "anachronistic" and emphasizing the importance of parental involvement. Additionally, he defended his criticism of a health-care policy requirement, saying it was included to reduce abortions and "cull the ranks of the disabled." Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception. END OF SUMMARY.
