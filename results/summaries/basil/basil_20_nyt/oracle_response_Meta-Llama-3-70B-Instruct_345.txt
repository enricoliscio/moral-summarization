SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to the President's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong" and "destructive," saying they reflected the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his views on education, calling the idea of federal or state governments running schools "anachronistic" and advocating for a more localized approach where "parents should be in charge." Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of the President's health-care policy, suggesting that it would lead to more abortions and "cull the ranks of the disabled in our society." His rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues, worrying instead about "undermining our civil liberties" and the national debt.
