SUMMARY: Rick Santorum caused controversy by implying that President Obama follows a "phony theology", suggesting that Obama's views are not based on the Bible. This comment was criticized by Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, as being "destructive" and contributing to the "nastiness, divisiveness [and] ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his belief in parental responsibility for education and his opposition to federal control of schools. He defended his criticism of Obama's health-care policy, accusing the president of lacking sympathy for the disabled and promoting abortions for disabled children. Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, criticized Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, questioning how such issues could be a priority over "undermining our civil liberties, the constant wars [...] and a debt of $16 trillion."
