Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

So, the article is about Rick Santorum making some comments during his campaign. He talked about President Obama's "phony theology," which he later clarified wasn't about Obama's faith but his view on man's relationship to the world. That's an important point because it shows Santorum is criticizing Obama's policies, not his personal beliefs.

Next, there's a response from Obama's political adviser, Robert Gibbs, who criticized Santorum's attacks on character and faith, calling them over the line. That adds context about the political back-and-forth.

Then, Santorum discusses education, saying that federal and state-run schools are outdated. He supports local control and parental involvement, which is a key part of his platform. He also mentions home-schooling his kids, which might be relevant to his stance.

He also criticized Obama's healthcare policy regarding prenatal testing, linking it to abortion rates. This ties into his pro-life stance and his daughter's condition, which adds a personal angle to his argument.

Lastly, Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismisses his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, emphasizing economic and civil liberties instead. This shows the divide within the Republican field.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Santorum's comments on Obama's theology, Gibbs' response, his education views, healthcare criticism, and Paul's dismissal. I'll make sure to keep it concise and cover all key aspects without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with Santorum's clarification, then Gibbs' criticism, followed by his education stance, healthcare comments, and end with Paul's reaction. That should cover all main points succinctly.
