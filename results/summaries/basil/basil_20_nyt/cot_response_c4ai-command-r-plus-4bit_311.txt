SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has clarified his recent comment that President Obama follows a "phony theology," stating that he was referring to the president's view of humanity's relationship with the world, rather than his religious faith. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness," and "destructive." Santorum also expressed his belief that public education should be locally run with parents in charge, and defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy regarding prenatal testing and abortion. He suggested that the policy encourages abortions of disabled children, an act he considers *wrong*. Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, believing that there are more pressing issues such as civil liberties, wars, and national debt.
