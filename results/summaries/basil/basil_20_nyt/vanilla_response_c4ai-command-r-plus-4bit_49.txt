SUMMARY: On Saturday, Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's agenda, referring to it as a "phony theology," suggesting that it was not based on the Bible. He also questioned the role of federal and state governments in running schools, advocating for more local control and parental involvement in education. In addition, Santorum defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, arguing that it promoted abortion for disabled children. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, called Santorum's remarks "destructive." Meanwhile, Ron Paul, Santorum's Republican rival, criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception instead of more pressing issues like civil liberties and the national debt. Santorum, however, remained firm in his stance, emphasizing parental involvement in education and his opposition to abortion.
