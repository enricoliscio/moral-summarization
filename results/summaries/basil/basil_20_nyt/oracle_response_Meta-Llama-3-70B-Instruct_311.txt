SUMMARY: 

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by labeling President Obama's agenda as a "phony theology" that deviates from biblical values. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of humanity's relationship with the world, rather than his faith. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, condemned the attack as "wrong" and "destructive", saying it reflected the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nomination process. Santorum also criticized the idea of federal or state governments running schools, calling it "anachronistic" and advocating for a more localized, parent-led approach. He defended his stance on prenatal testing, suggesting that Obama's policy would lead to more abortions and a lack of care for the disabled. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues, worrying instead about "undermining our civil liberties" and the national debt.
