SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that prioritizes the state over individual responsibility. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of humanity's relationship with the world, not his faith. The comment was widely criticized, with Obama's adviser Robert Gibbs calling it "wrong" and "destructive". Santorum also expressed his views on education, stating that the idea of federal or state governments running schools is "anachronistic" and that parents should be in charge of their children's education. He defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting that it would lead to more abortions and neglect of the disabled. Santorum's rivals, including Ron Paul, have dismissed his focus on social issues, arguing that it's unrealistic to think he can defeat Obama.
