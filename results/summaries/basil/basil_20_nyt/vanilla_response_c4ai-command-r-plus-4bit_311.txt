SUMMARY: During a campaign stop in Ohio, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum made controversial comments about President Obama's "phony theology" and public education. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to Obama, criticized Santorum's remarks as divisive and destructive. Santorum also criticized the federal and state governments' involvement in public education, advocating for local control and parental involvement. He defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, suggesting that the president lacked sympathy for the disabled. One of Santorum's rivals, Ron Paul, criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception. Santorum stood by his comments, emphasizing his concern for civil liberties and national debt.
