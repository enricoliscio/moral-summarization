Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I need to make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rick Santorum's comments during his campaign. He criticized Obama's theology, saying it's phony, not based on the Bible. He also talked about education, preferring local control over federal or state-run schools. Additionally, he criticized Obama's healthcare policy regarding prenatal testing, suggesting it leads to more abortions, especially for disabled children. Robert Gibbs responded, calling Santorum's attacks wrong and destructive. Ron Paul criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues instead of more pressing economic and civil liberties issues.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided: theology, ideal, attacks, line, wrong, destructive, divisiveness, charge, optimizes, cover, care, cull, lacked, undermining.

I'll structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. For example, Santorum's comments on theology, the attacks on Obama's character, the wrong and destructive nature of those attacks, the idea of culling disabled children, and the undermining of civil liberties.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including the key moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Santorum's clarification on theology, then Gibbs' criticism, followed by Santorum's education views, his healthcare policy criticism, and Paul's response. I'll make sure each point includes the moral framing words where relevant.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence incorporates the necessary terms without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points and moral terms are included effectively.

Rick Santorum recently clarified his remarks about President Obamaâ€™s "phony theology," explaining he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world rather than his faith. However, Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, condemned such attacks on Obama's character and faith, calling them "wrong" and "destructive," and reflecting the "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also criticized the idea of federal or state-run schools, calling it "anachronistic," and argued that public education should be locally controlled, with parents in charge of designing an educational environment that "optimizes" each child's potential. He defended his criticism of Obama's health-care policy, which he claimed "culls" the ranks of the disabled by promoting prenatal testing to reduce abortion costs. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, mocked his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that such debates "undermine" civil liberties and distract from more pressing issues like the national debt and constant wars.
