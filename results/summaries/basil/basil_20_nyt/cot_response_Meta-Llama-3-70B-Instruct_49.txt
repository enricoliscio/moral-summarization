SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's comment as "wrong," "destructive," and reflective of the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his opposition to federal and state governments running schools, calling it "anachronistic" and believing that parents should be in charge of their children's education. Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of Obama's health-care policy, suggesting that it is "bad" for the disabled. His rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, saying it's not possible for him to defeat Obama.
