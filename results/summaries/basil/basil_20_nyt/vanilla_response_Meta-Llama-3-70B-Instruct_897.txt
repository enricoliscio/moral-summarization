SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his comment that President Obama subscribed to a "phony theology," saying he was referring to the president's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Santorum made the original comment during a campaign stop in Ohio, where he also criticized the idea of federal or state governments running schools, calling it "anachronistic." He believes parents should be in charge of their children's education, working with local school districts. Santorum also defended his criticism of a requirement in the president's health-care policy that insurance companies cover prenatal testing, saying it could lead to more abortions. Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized Santorum's attacks on "character and faith," calling them "wrong" and "destructive." Ron Paul, a rival for the Republican nomination, scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues, saying he should focus on bigger issues like civil liberties and the national debt.
