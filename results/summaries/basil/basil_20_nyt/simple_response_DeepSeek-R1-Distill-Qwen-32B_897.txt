Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

Santorum made comments about Obama's theology, which he later clarified. He also discussed education, preferring local control over federal or state-run schools. Additionally, he criticized Obama's healthcare policy regarding prenatal testing, linking it to abortion rates. There's also a mention of Ron Paul's criticism of Santorum focusing on social issues.

I should highlight the moral aspects, like Santorum's criticism of Obama's theology and healthcare policy, and the implications on social issues. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure the summary: start with Santorum's clarification on theology, then move to education views, followed by healthcare criticism, and end with Paul's response. Make sure to include the moral framing elements like the impact on abortion rates and the focus on social issues over economic ones.

I'll ensure the summary is clear and captures the key moral points without adding my own opinions. Keep it factual but highlight the ethical dimensions Santorum emphasized.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum recently clarified his earlier statement that President Obama subscribed to a “phony theology,” explaining he was referring to Obama’s view of man’s relationship to the world, not his personal faith. Santorum criticized Obama’s agenda as based on a non-Biblical theology, sparking backlash from Obama’s adviser, Robert Gibbs, who called the remarks “wrong” and “destructive.” Santorum also criticized federal and state control of schools, advocating for local governance and parental involvement in education, though he acknowledged government’s role in supporting schools. He further condemned Obama’s healthcare policy for promoting prenatal testing, linking it to increased abortions and a lack of sympathy for the disabled. Santorum’s rival, Ron Paul, criticized his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, instead emphasizing economic and civil liberties concerns.  

END OF SUMMARY.
