SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, a Republican presidential candidate, attempted to clarify his earlier statement that President Obama follows a "phony theology," asserting that he was referring to the president's perspective on humanity's relationship with the world rather than his religious beliefs. Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to Obama, criticized Santorum's remarks as divisive and destructive. Santorum also emphasized his support for local control and parental involvement in education, expressing skepticism about the federal government's role in running schools. He defended his critique of Obama's health care policy, arguing that it encourages abortions among disabled children. Ron Paul, another Republican contender, criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, believing it distracts from more pressing issues like civil liberties, wars, and national debt.
