SUMMARY: Rick Santorum stirred controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology," suggesting that Obama's views on man's relationship with the world are not based on the Bible. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as destructive and divisive. Santorum also advocated for local control and parental involvement in education, deeming federal involvement in schools as anachronistic. He defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting it promotes abortions for disabled children. Meanwhile, Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that civil liberties and national debt are more pressing concerns.
