SUMMARY: Rick Santorum attempted to clarify his controversial remark that President Obama follows a "phony theology", attributing it to their differing views on the relationship between man and the world. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as destructive and divisive. Santorum also questioned the role of federal and state governments in running schools, advocating for more parental involvement and local control in education. He defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, suggesting that it encourages abortion for disabled children. He stood by his comment, claiming that Obama has a poor record regarding abortion and disabled children. Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, criticized Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing that more pressing issues like civil liberties and national debt should take precedence.
