SUMMARY: Rick Santorum stirred controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology," which he later clarified as referring to their differing views on man's relationship with the world. Robert Gibbs criticized Santorum's remarks as "destructive" and "over the line," reflecting the "divisiveness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also advocated for local control of education, with parents in charge, and criticized Obama's health-care policy, suggesting it promotes abortion for disabled children. He defended his stance, stating that Obama lacked sympathy for the disabled. Meanwhile, Ron Paul scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, believing it distracts from more pressing issues like civil liberties and national debt. Santorum's remarks and subsequent defense highlight a morally charged exchange between political figures, with implications for individual rights, responsibilities, and societal welfare.
