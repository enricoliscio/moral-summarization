SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his comment that President Obama subscribed to a "phony theology," saying he was referring to the president's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Santorum made the original comment during a campaign stop in Ohio, where he also expressed his belief that public education should be locally run and that the federal government should not be in charge of schools. He defended his criticism of the president's health-care policy, saying that it included prenatal testing to reduce the number of disabled children. Santorum's rivals, including Robert Gibbs and Ron Paul, criticized his comments, with Gibbs calling them "wrong" and "destructive" and Paul saying that Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception was misguided.
