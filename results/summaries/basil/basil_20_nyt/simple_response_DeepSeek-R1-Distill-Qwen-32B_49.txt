Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Santorum called Obama's theology "phony," referring to his view on man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Gibbs, Obama's adviser, criticized this as over the line, calling it wrong and destructive. That's a moral judgment against Santorum's approach.

Next, Santorum talks about public education, saying it's anachronistic and should be locally run with parents in charge. He supports government help but not federal control. This seems to tie into a moral stance on family values and local control.

Then, Santorum criticizes Obama's health-care policy on prenatal testing, linking it to abortion and disability. He has a daughter with a chromosomal disorder, so this is a personal issue for him. He accuses Obama of a bad record on abortion and disability, which is another moral critique.

Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismisses his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, saying it's a distraction from bigger issues like debt and civil liberties. Paul is making a moral argument that Santorum is not addressing the real problems.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight Santorum's moral critiques on theology, education, and health care, as well as the counterarguments from Gibbs and Paul. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me structure it: start with Santorum's comments on Obama's theology and the criticism. Then move to education, his stance on local control. Next, the health-care policy and his personal angle. Finally, Paul's dismissal of Santorum's focus. Conclude by noting the moral and political implications.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise. Make sure each point is clear and ties back to the moral aspects. Let me draft that.
