SUMMARY: 
Rick Santorum has clarified his earlier comment that President Obama follows a "phony theology", saying he was referring to the President's view of humanity's relationship with the world, rather than his faith. This clarification comes after Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as "destructive", "nastiness", "divisiveness", and "ugliness". Santorum has also defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, which requires insurance companies to cover prenatal testing. Santorum believes this leads to more abortions of disabled children, an issue he feels Obama has a "bad record" on. The former senator has faced backlash from rival Ron Paul, who scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, believing that civil liberties and constant wars are more pressing concerns. Santorum stands firm in his beliefs and continues to advocate for parental control in education and local governance.
