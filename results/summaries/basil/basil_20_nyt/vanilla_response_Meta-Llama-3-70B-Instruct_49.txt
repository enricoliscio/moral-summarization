SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum has sparked controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology" and views on education and healthcare. Santorum clarified that he was referring to Obama's worldview, not his faith. He also criticized the idea of federal or state governments running schools, calling it "anachronistic" and advocating for locally run, parent-driven education. Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting that it promotes abortions and lacks sympathy for the disabled. His rival, Ron Paul, dismissed Santorum's focus on social issues, saying it's unrealistic to think he can defeat Obama. Paul emphasized the need to focus on civil liberties, wars, and the national debt. Santorum's comments have been met with criticism from Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, who called them "wrong" and "destructive".
