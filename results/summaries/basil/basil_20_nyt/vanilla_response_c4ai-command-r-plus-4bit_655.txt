SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, a Republican nominee, caused controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology" and his views on public education. He clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship with the world and not his faith. Santorum also criticized the idea of federal or state governments running schools, advocating for local control and parental involvement in education. He defended his stance on abortion and prenatal testing, suggesting that Obama lacked sympathy for the disabled. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's attacks as divisive and destructive. Meanwhile, Ron Paul, another Republican nominee, scoffed at Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception instead of more pressing issues like civil liberties and national debt. Santorum's comments have sparked debates about the role of government in education and the sensitivity of discussing abortion and disability.
END OF SUMMARY.
