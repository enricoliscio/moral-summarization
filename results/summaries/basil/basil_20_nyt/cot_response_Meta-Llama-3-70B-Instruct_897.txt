SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of subscribing to a "phony theology" that prioritizes a "different theology" over the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's comments as "wrong," "destructive," and reflective of the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his opposition to federal and state governments running schools, calling it "anachronistic" and advocating for a more localized approach. Additionally, he defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting that it was designed to reduce costs by encouraging abortions and "cull[ing] the ranks of the disabled." Santorum's rivals, including Ron Paul, have criticized him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception. END OF SUMMARY.
