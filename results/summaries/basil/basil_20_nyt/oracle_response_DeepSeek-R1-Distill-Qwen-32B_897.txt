Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Rick Santorum making some controversial comments during his campaign. He criticized President Obama's theology, saying it's "phony" and not based on the Bible. This led to criticism from Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, who called the attacks on character and faith wrong and destructive. Santorum also talked about education, arguing against federal control of schools and promoting local control and parental involvement. He mentioned home-schooling and criticized the current public school system as outdated. Additionally, Santorum criticized Obama's healthcare policy for covering prenatal testing, suggesting it leads to more abortions and a lack of care for disabled children. He defended his stance on social issues, while his rival Ron Paul dismissed his focus on such topics, instead emphasizing economic and civil liberties issues.

Now, I need to extract the key points and use the morally framed words provided. The words are: theology, ideal, attacks, line, wrong, destructive, divisiveness, charge, optimizes, cover, care, cull, lacked, undermining.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning Santorum's clarification on theology, then Gibbs' criticism, followed by Santorum's views on education and healthcare, and finally Paul's dismissal.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the moral words as possible without forcing them. Let me draft this step by step.

First sentence: Santorum clarified his theology comment, referring to Obama's view on man's relationship to the world. Then, Gibbs criticized the attacks on character and faith, calling them wrong and destructive, reflecting divisiveness. Next, Santorum discussed education, emphasizing local control and parental charge, optimizing potential. He criticized federal control as anachronistic. Then, on healthcare, he argued Obama's policy covers prenatal testing, which could cull disabled, implying Obama lacks care. Lastly, Paul dismissed Santorum's focus on social issues, instead worrying about undermining civil liberties and debt.

I think that covers all the key points and includes most of the moral words. Let me count the words to ensure it's under 200.

Santorum also criticized federal control of schools, arguing it is anachronistic, and emphasized the parent's charge in education, advocating for a dynamic, locally run system to optimize each child's potential. He further criticized Obama's healthcare policy for covering prenatal testing, suggesting it could cull disabled individuals and lacked care for them. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, instead emphasizing concerns about undermining civil liberties and the national debt. END OF SUMMARY.
