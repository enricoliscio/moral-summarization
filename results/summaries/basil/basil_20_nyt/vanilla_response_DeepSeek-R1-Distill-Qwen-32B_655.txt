Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Rick Santorum's comments. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that Santorum clarified his earlier statement about President Obama's "phony theology." He explained that he wasn't attacking Obama's faith but rather his views on man's relationship to the world. That's an important point to include.

Then, there's a response from Robert Gibbs, Obama's adviser, who criticized Santorum's attacks on Obama's character and faith. Gibbs called the remarks destructive and part of the nastiness in the Republican race. I should note that as well.

Next, Santorum talks about public education, saying it's anachronistic for the federal or state governments to run schools. He believes education should be locally run, with parents in charge. He supports government help but not the current big bureaucracy. That's a key point about his education stance.

He also criticized Obama's healthcare policy regarding prenatal testing, linking it to abortion rates and his daughter's condition. This shows his stance on abortion and disability issues.

Lastly, Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, mocks him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception instead of bigger issues like the economy and wars. Paul's criticism is another important angle to include.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover Santorum's clarification, Gibbs' criticism, his views on education, healthcare, and Paul's response. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
