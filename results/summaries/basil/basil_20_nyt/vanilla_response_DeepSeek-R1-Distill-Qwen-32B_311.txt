Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by mentioning that Santorum tried to clarify his comment about President Obama's theology. He said it wasn't about Obama's faith but his view on man's relationship to the world. That happened during a campaign stop in Ohio. He called Obama's agenda "phony theology" based on a non-Biblical belief. 

Then, Robert Gibbs, Obama's adviser, criticized Santorum's attacks on Obama's character and faith, calling them over the line and destructive. 

Next, Santorum talks about schools. He doesn't think federal or state governments should run schools; he finds that idea outdated. He supports local control and parental involvement in education, saying parents should be in charge, working with local districts to design education for each child. 

He also criticized Obama's healthcare policy regarding prenatal testing, suggesting it's to save money by increasing abortions. He has a daughter with a chromosomal disorder and believes doctors often recommend abortion in such cases. He accused Obama of having a bad record on abortion and disabled children. 

Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, mocked him for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, instead of more pressing issues like civil liberties, wars, and debt. 

So, the summary needs to cover Santorum's clarification on theology, Gibbs' criticism, Santorum's views on education, his healthcare policy criticism, and Paul's criticism of Santorum's focus. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and in the specified format. 

I should structure it by first addressing the theology comment and Gibbs' response, then move on to education, healthcare, and Paul's remarks. Keep each point brief and clear. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. 

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary.
