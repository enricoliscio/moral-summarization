SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that is "not based on the Bible." Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. However, Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to Obama, criticized Santorum's comment as a "wrong" and "destructive" attack on the president's character and faith, reflecting the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also expressed his views on education, stating that the idea of federal or state governments running schools is "anachronistic" and that parents should be "in charge" of their children's education. Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of Obama's health-care policy, suggesting that the president "lacked" sympathy for the disabled. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, scoffed at his focus on social issues, worrying instead about "undermining our civil liberties" and the national debt.
