SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, criticized Santorum's attack as "wrong" and "destructive". Santorum also expressed his views on education, stating that public schools should be locally run and that parents should be in charge of their children's education. He defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting that it leads to more abortions and a lack of care for the disabled. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, saying it's not a winning strategy against Obama.
