Okay, I need to help the user summarize the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Rick Santorum's comments and the reactions to them. The key is to identify the morally framed words and ensure they are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Santorum criticized Obama's theology and education policies, faced criticism for his remarks, and defended his stance on healthcare. He also faced criticism from Ron Paul regarding his focus on social issues.

Next, I'll note the morally charged words: theology, ideal, attacks, line, wrong, destructive, divisiveness, charge, optimizes, cover, care, cull, lacked, undermining. I need to make sure these are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to cover Santorum's comments on theology, education, healthcare, and the reactions from Gibbs and Paul. I'll keep each point concise, using the moral terms where appropriate.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Santorum's clarification on theology, then move to education, followed by healthcare, and finally the criticism from Paul. Each section should be brief but include the necessary moral language.

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without being too verbose. It's important to maintain the moral framing as the author intended, so I'll use words like "attacks," "wrong," "destructive," and "undermining" appropriately.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral terms are preserved. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Once satisfied, I'll present the summary as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum clarified his earlier statement about President Obama's "phony theology," explaining it referred to Obama's view of man's relationship to the world, not his faith. Santorum criticized Obama's agenda as based on a "phony ideal" and a non-Biblical theology, sparking criticism from Obama's adviser, Robert Gibbs, who called the remarks "wrong" and "destructive," reflecting the "nastiness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also criticized federal control of schools, calling it "anachronistic," and advocated for local, parent-driven education. He defended his stance on Obama's health-care policy, which he accused of promoting abortion by covering prenatal testing, arguing it "culls" the disabled. Santorum's rival, Ron Paul, dismissed his focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, emphasizing broader concerns like debt and civil liberties instead. END OF SUMMARY.
