Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. They provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I need to understand the main points of the article.

Rick Santorum made some comments about Obama's theology and education policies. The user wants the summary to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should identify where those words fit naturally in the summary.

I'll start by noting Santorum's clarification about the theology comment, making sure to include "phony theology" and "ideal." Then, mention Gibbs' criticism using "attacks," "line," "wrong," and "destructive." Next, cover Santorum's stance on education, using "charge," "public education," and "locally run." 

I should also include his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, using "cover," "care," and "cull." Finally, add Ron Paul's reaction, highlighting "undermining" and "civil liberties." I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral language.

I'll structure the summary to cover each point succinctly, making sure each moral term is included where appropriate. Let me piece this together, ensuring each section is clear and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum recently clarified his earlier statement that President Obama subscribed to a “phony theology,” explaining he was referring to Obama’s view of man’s relationship to the world, not his faith. Santorum criticized Obama’s agenda as based on a “phony ideal” and a non-Biblical theology. Political adviser Robert Gibbs condemned such attacks on Obama’s character and faith, calling them “wrong” and “destructive,” and reflecting the “nastiness” of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also criticized federal and state control of schools, calling it “anachronistic,” and advocated for local control and parental involvement in education. He emphasized that public education should be “dynamic” and tailored to each child’s potential. Additionally, Santorum criticized Obama’s health-care policy for covering prenatal testing, suggesting it could lead to more abortions and “cull” disabled children. He accused Obama of having a “bad record” on abortion and disability issues. Meanwhile, rival Ron Paul criticized Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, arguing such debates undermine civil liberties and distract from more pressing issues like debt and war.  
END OF SUMMARY.
