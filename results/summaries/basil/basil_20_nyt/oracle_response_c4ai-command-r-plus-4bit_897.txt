SUMMARY: Rick Santorum on Sunday clarified his comment that President Obama subscribed to a “phony theology,” saying he was referring to the president’s view of man’s relationship with the world, not his faith. Robert Gibbs criticized such "attacks" on the president's "character and faith," calling them "wrong" and "destructive." Mr. Santorum also stood by his criticism of the president's health-care policy, which he believes includes prenatal testing to save money by "culling" the disabled through abortion. He defended his stance, saying that the president "lacked" sympathy for the disabled and had a "very bad record" on abortion and children with disabilities. Meanwhile, Ron Paul scoffed at Mr. Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, believing he could defeat Mr. Obama by discussing such issues. Mr. Paul expressed concern about more pressing issues such as civil liberties, wars, and the national debt.
