SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has caused controversy by suggesting that President Obama follows a "phony theology", claiming that the president's views are not based on the Bible. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as being "over the line" and contributing to the "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness" and destructive nature of the Republican nominating process. Santorum has also been adamant about his stance on local control of education and his criticism of the president's health care policy, suggesting it encourages abortion for disabled children. He defended his comments, arguing that Obama has a bad record when it comes to abortion and the disabled. Meanwhile, Ron Paul has scoffed at Santorum for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception, questioning how these issues will help defeat Obama in the election. He believes that more pressing issues like civil liberties, wars, and the national debt should be the focus. END OF SUMMARY.
