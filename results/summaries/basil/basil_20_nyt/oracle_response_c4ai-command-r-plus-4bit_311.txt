SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has caused controversy with his comments on President Obama's "phony theology," suggesting that the president's views on the relationship between man and the world are not based on the Bible. Robert Gibbs, an Obama adviser, criticized Santorum's remarks as "destructive" and "over the line," reflecting the "nastiness and divisiveness" of the Republican nominating process. Santorum also questioned the role of federal and state governments in running schools, arguing that parents should be in charge of their children's education with the help of local school districts. He defended his criticism of Obama's health care policy, suggesting that it encourages abortions and undermines care for the disabled. Ron Paul, Santorum's rival, scoffed at Santorum's focus on social issues like abortion and contraception, believing that civil liberties and national debt are more pressing issues. Santorum's comments have sparked debate and raised questions about the role of government and the moral values of the candidates.
END OF SUMMARY.
