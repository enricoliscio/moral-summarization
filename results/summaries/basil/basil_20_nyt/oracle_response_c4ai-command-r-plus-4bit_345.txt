SUMMARY: Rick Santorum tried to clarify his comment that President Obama subscribed to a “phony theology,” saying he was referring to the president’s view of man’s relationship with the world, and not his faith. Robert Gibbs criticized such "attacks" on the President's "character and faith," calling them “destructive” and reflective of the “divisiveness” and “ugliness” of the Republican nominating process. Mr. Santorum also expressed his belief that parents should be in charge of their children's education, working with local schools to "optimize" their potential. He defended his criticism of the President's health care policy, which requires insurance companies to "cover" prenatal testing, saying that the policy leads to more abortions and "culls" the ranks of the disabled. Mr Santorum's comments have sparked debate and "undermined" his position with rival Ron Paul scoffing at his focus on social issues. END OF SUMMARY.
