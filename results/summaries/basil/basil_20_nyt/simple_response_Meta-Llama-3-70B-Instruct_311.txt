SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum sparked controversy by calling President Obama's agenda a "phony theology" that is not based on the Bible. Santorum later clarified that he was referring to Obama's view of humanity's relationship with the world, not his faith. The comment was criticized by Obama's adviser Robert Gibbs, who deemed it "wrong" and "destructive". Santorum also expressed his views on education, stating that the idea of federal or state governments running schools is "anachronistic" and that parents should be in charge of their children's education. Additionally, Santorum defended his criticism of Obama's healthcare policy, suggesting that it is designed to reduce abortions and "cull the ranks of the disabled". Santorum's views were met with skepticism by rival Ron Paul, who believes that focusing on social issues will not lead to victory against Obama.
