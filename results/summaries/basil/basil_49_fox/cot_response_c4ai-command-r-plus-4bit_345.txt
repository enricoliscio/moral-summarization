SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, arguing that it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause and undermines their own state efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers defended the law, stating that the lawsuit is without *merit* and that the primary grievance of the plaintiffs stems from non-enforcement of federal laws, rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning claims that Colorado marijuana is *trafficked* into Nebraska, *straining* the state's finances and legal system with increased *arrests*, *impounding*, and *seizing*. He also *complained* about the cost to Nebraska taxpayers. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, *reaping* the benefits of marijuana sales while neighboring states struggle with the consequences. Nebraska Sheriff Mark Overman expressed his *frustration*, stating that he has taken an *oath* to uphold the law and should not have to pick and choose which laws to enforce. The lawsuit has been criticized as *overturning* the will of Colorado voters and being on the *wrong* side of history. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper also questioned the constructive nature of the lawsuit in addressing the concerns of neighboring states. Legal scholars and law enforcement officials are uncertain about the outcome of the case and the potential impact on other states with similar laws. END OF SUMMARY.
