SUMMARY: Colorado's top law enforcement official has vowed to vigorously defend the state's marijuana legalization law after Nebraska and Oklahoma challenged its constitutionality in the U.S. Supreme Court. The two states argue that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into their states, undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws and causing financial strain. They claim that Colorado is violating the Constitution's supremacy clause by running afoul of federal law. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating that it is based on the nonenforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit highlights the impact of Colorado's legal weed on law enforcement agencies in neighboring states, but lacks statistics to support the claims. Legal scholars say the outcome of the case is uncertain, with the regulations existing in a legal no-man's-land. The challenge is seen as political grandstanding by some, while others argue that it shows the plaintiffs are on the wrong side of history as more states move towards legalization.
END OF SUMMARY.
