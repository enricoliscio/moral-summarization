SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, arguing that it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause and undermines their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. Colorado's top law enforcement official, Attorney General John Suthers, has vowed to vigorously defend the state's law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance of the neighboring states stems from the non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana. The lawsuit highlights the financial and legal strains on Nebraska and Oklahoma due to increased arrests, housing inmates, impounding vehicles, and seizing drugs related to Colorado marijuana. It also blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce the federal law's ban on marijuana. Colorado has raised significant revenue from the sale of medical and recreational marijuana, while law enforcement agencies in neighboring states claim they are feeling the impacts of legal weed with increased arrests and seizures. The outcome of this case is uncertain, but it has brought attention to the legal gray area surrounding state-level legalization of marijuana.
END OF SUMMARY.
