SUMMARY:
Colorado's top law enforcement official, Attorney General John Suthers, vows to vigorously defend the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning blames Colorado for "heavily trafficked" contraband, straining Nebraska's finances and legal systems. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from medical and recreational marijuana sales. Critics call the lawsuit "political grandstanding" without merit, citing 23 states that have enacted medical marijuana laws without being overturned. Colorado voters passed the measure, and more states are following suit, putting Nebraska and Oklahoma on the "wrong side of history." END OF SUMMARY.
