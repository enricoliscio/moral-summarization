SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional. The lawsuit argues that the law, which allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21, violates the Constitution's supremacy clause and allows marijuana to flow into neighboring states. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit claims that Colorado marijuana is undermining neighboring states' efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws, but lacks statistics to support the claim. Law enforcement agencies have anecdotally reported feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, but there is no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado. The moral framing of this issue highlights the tension between states' rights and federal law, as well as the responsibility of law enforcement to uphold the law.

END OF SUMMARY.
