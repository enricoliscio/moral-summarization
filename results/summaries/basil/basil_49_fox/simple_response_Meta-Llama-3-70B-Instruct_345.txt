SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana law after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it's unconstitutional. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law, which allows recreational marijuana for adults, violates federal law and is causing marijuana to flow into their states, undermining their anti-marijuana laws. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit and that the real issue is the non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales, while Nebraska and Oklahoma claim they are bearing the costs of policing and housing inmates related to Colorado pot. The lawsuit has sparked debate, with some law enforcement officials supporting the challenge and others calling it "political grandstanding" without merit.

END OF SUMMARY.
