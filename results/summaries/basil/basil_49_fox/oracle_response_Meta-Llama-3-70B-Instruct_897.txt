SUMMARY:

Colorado's top law enforcement official, Attorney General John Suthers, is defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and undermines their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, straining their finances and legal systems. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado's non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana is the primary grievance, and that the state is failing to prevent the drug from being trafficked into other states. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from medical and recreational marijuana, while Nebraska taxpayers bear the cost of policing and housing inmates. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's legal weed is having a significant impact on neighboring states, but lacks concrete statistics to support the claim. END OF SUMMARY.
