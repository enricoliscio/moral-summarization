SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, arguing that it has led to an influx of the drug into their states and caused a strain on their resources. Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance of the neighboring states is with the non-enforcement of federal laws. The lawsuit highlights the financial and legal burden on Nebraska and Oklahoma, with law enforcement spending more time and money on arrests, housing inmates, and seizing drugs. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from marijuana sales since the law was passed in 2012. Legal scholars and advocates for legalization argue that the challenge is political grandstanding and that it is unlikely for the Supreme Court to accept the case. This case highlights the ongoing tensions between states with differing approaches to marijuana legalization and the potential for interstate conflict as a result of varying laws.
END OF SUMMARY.
