SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the state's marijuana legalization. The two states argue that Colorado's law, Amendment 64, is unconstitutional as it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause by running contrary to federal law. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has vowed to defend the law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary issue is with the enforcement of federal laws rather than the choice made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit claims that Colorado marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, causing financial strain and undermining law enforcement efforts in Nebraska and Oklahoma. It also blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce federal law. Colorado has raised significant revenue from marijuana sales, while law enforcement agencies in neighboring states claim they are facing increased costs due to the impact of Colorado's legal weed. Legal scholars say the outcome of the case is uncertain, and it remains to be seen if other states will join the lawsuit. Supporters of Colorado's law argue that the challenge is politically motivated and without merit, pointing to the growing number of states enacting similar legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
