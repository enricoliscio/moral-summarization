SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, claiming that it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause by running afoul of federal law. The lawsuit argues that Colorado is failing to keep marijuana in-state as required by federal priorities, and that this has strained neighboring states' finances and legal systems as they deal with the impacts of Colorado pot. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has dismissed the lawsuit as without merit, stating that it is based on the non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The case highlights the ongoing debate between states' rights to legalize marijuana and federal laws banning the drug. Legal scholars are unsure how the Supreme Court will handle the case if it is accepted. This challenge to Colorado's law underscores the complex legal landscape surrounding marijuana legalization and the potential for conflicts between state and federal regulations.
END OF SUMMARY.
