Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want a concise summary that reflects the original's tone and arguments.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Colorado defending its marijuana law against challenges from Nebraska and Oklahoma. The neighboring states are suing because they say Colorado's law is causing problems, like increased marijuana trafficking, which affects their enforcement efforts and costs.

I should note the key players: Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers, Nebraska's Jon Bruning, and Oklahoma's officials. They argue that Colorado's law violates the supremacy clause because it conflicts with federal laws. Colorado counters that the lawsuit lacks merit and that the real issue is federal enforcement, not their state law.

Also, the article mentions the financial impact on Colorado versus the costs to Nebraska and Oklahoma. Colorado has made money from taxes, while the other states are spending more on law enforcement. There's a point about the lack of concrete data supporting the claims, which is an important detail for the summary.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main arguments from both sides, the legal basis of the lawsuit, and the responses from Colorado. I should also include the mention of the federal government's stance on enforcement priorities and the experts' opinions on the case's potential outcome.

I'll structure the summary to first state the challenge, then Colorado's defense, the reasons given by the plaintiffs, the financial aspects, and the legal experts' perspectives. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing, such as Colorado's argument about states' rights versus federal law and the frustration of neighboring states over enforcement issues.

I need to ensure that the summary is balanced, presenting both sides' viewpoints without bias. Also, I should avoid jargon and keep the language clear and concise. Let me piece together the main points, making sure each sentence adds value without exceeding the word limit.

Finally, I'll check that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's Amendment 64, passed in 2012, allows marijuana to flow into neighboring states, undermining their anti-drug efforts and straining their resources. Suthers dismissed the case as meritless, stating it reflects federal enforcement failures rather than Colorado's state law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for profiting from marijuana sales while other states bear the costs of enforcement. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes from legal marijuana, which began retail sales in 2014. The lawsuit highlights increased marijuana arrests and seizures in Nebraska and Oklahoma, though no concrete data supports the claims. Colorado counters that the challenge is politically motivated and without legal basis, as 23 states have medical marijuana laws without federal overturn. Legal experts note the case is unusual and its outcome uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
