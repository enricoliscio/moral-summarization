Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Colorado's marijuana law being challenged by neighboring states. They provided the article, which is pretty detailed. My task is to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012 with Amendment 64, and now Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing, saying it's unconstitutional because it violates the supremacy clause. They argue that Colorado's pot is flowing into their states, causing issues. 

I need to highlight the key players: Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers defending the law, the lawsuit's claims, the financial impact on Colorado versus the costs to Nebraska and Oklahoma. Also, the federal stance on not having the resources to enforce all marijuana laws, and the response from other states and legal experts.

I should structure the summary to include the lawsuit details, Colorado's defense, the impact on neighboring states, the federal perspective, and reactions from other parties. Keeping it concise is important, so I'll focus on the main facts without getting too bogged down in specifics like the exact amounts or quotes unless they're crucial.

I'll start by stating that Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana law, citing constitutional issues. Then mention the state's defense and the federal angle. Finally, touch on the reactions and the uncertainty of the Supreme Court's decision.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all essential points without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it, then check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging its 2012 marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, claiming it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause by conflicting with federal law. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as lacking merit, stating it stems from federal non-enforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. The lawsuit alleges Colorado's marijuana flows into neighboring states, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances and legal systems. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for profiting while his state bears costs. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales. The U.S. Justice Department has prioritized federal enforcement but lacks resources to police all violations. Some law enforcement agencies report increased marijuana arrests, but exact figures on Colorado pot leaving the state are unclear. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper expressed doubt about the lawsuit's effectiveness, while legal scholars question the Supreme Court's likely response. Other states, like Utah and New Mexico, have not joined the suit, and Colorado advocates argue the challenge is politically motivated. END OF SUMMARY.
