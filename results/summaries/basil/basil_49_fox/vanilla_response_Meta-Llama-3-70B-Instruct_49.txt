SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has defended the state's law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit with the US Supreme Court, claiming the law is unconstitutional and allows marijuana to flow into neighboring states. The lawsuit argues that the measure violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which prioritizes federal laws over state laws. Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit and that the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado-grown marijuana is undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws, straining their finances and legal systems. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from medical and recreational marijuana sales. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case.

END OF SUMMARY.
