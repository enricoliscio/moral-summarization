SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit with the US Supreme Court, claiming it is unconstitutional and allows marijuana to flow into their states. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law, approved by voters in 2012, violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit has no merit, saying it stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than Colorado's choices. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado-grown marijuana is being trafficked into their states, straining their finances and legal systems. Despite raising over $60 million in taxes and fees, Colorado's marijuana sales have been a point of contention for neighboring states. The lawsuit's outcome is uncertain, with legal scholars saying it's too early to know how the Supreme Court will handle the case.

END OF SUMMARY.
