SUMMARY:
Colorado's top law enforcement official, Attorney General John Suthers, is vigorously defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional. The lawsuit argues that the measure allows marijuana to freely flow into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce federal law's ban on drugs in Colorado. However, Suthers claims the lawsuit is without merit, saying the primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws, rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. Legalization advocates call the challenge "political grandstanding" without merit, citing that 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws without being overturned. END OF SUMMARY.
