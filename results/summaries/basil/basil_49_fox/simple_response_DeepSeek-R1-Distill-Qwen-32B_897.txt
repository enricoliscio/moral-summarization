Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Colorado's marijuana law and the challenges from neighboring states. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the ethical and legal arguments presented.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012 with Amendment 64, which has raised over $60 million in taxes. Neighboring states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court, claiming it's unconstitutional because it violates federal law and the supremacy clause. They argue that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into their states, causing financial and legal issues.

Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, defends the law, saying it's a state choice and that the lawsuit lacks merit. The plaintiffs argue that Colorado isn't enforcing federal laws, leading to increased arrests and costs. The U.S. Justice Department has stated it doesn't have the resources to enforce all federal marijuana laws but expects states to handle it responsibly.

I should highlight the moral arguments: Colorado sees this as state sovereignty and voter choice, while the plaintiffs view it as a failure to enforce federal laws, leading to negative impacts on their states. The summary should reflect both sides' perspectives, emphasizing the ethical debate over state rights versus federal law.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise, capturing the moral framing without getting bogged down in details. I'll structure it by stating Colorado's stance, the lawsuit's claims, the federal response, and the ongoing debate.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's 2012 marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The neighboring states argue that Colorado's legal marijuana is flowing into their jurisdictions, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances and legal systems. Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating it reflects concerns over federal law enforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved policy. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for profiting from marijuana sales while other states bear the costs of enforcement. The lawsuit highlights a moral conflict between state sovereignty and federal law, with Colorado asserting its right to legalize marijuana while plaintiffs argue it disrupts federal drug laws. Legal experts note the case is unprecedented, as states rarely sue each other, and its outcome could set a precedent for similar disputes. END OF SUMMARY.
