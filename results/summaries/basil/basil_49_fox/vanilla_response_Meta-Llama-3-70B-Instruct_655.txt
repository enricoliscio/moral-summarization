SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit with the US Supreme Court, claiming the law is unconstitutional and allows marijuana to flow into their states. The lawsuit argues that the law violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which prioritizes federal laws over state laws. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit, saying it's primarily about non-enforcement of federal laws rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's legal marijuana has strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems, but lacks statistical evidence. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes and fees from medical and recreational marijuana sales. Legal scholars say it's unclear how the Supreme Court will handle the case, but Colorado officials are confident in their law.
