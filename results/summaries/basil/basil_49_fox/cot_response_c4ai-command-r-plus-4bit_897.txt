SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, arguing that it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause by contravening federal law. The *complaint* alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely *trafficked* into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws and *straining* their finances and legal systems. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismissed the *merit* of the *grievance*, arguing that it stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choice made by Colorado voters. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning decried the influx of Colorado marijuana as *contraband*, claiming that while Colorado *reaps* millions from sales, Nebraska taxpayers must *bear* the cost of increased law enforcement, including *arrests*, *housing* inmates, *impounding* vehicles, and *seizing* drugs. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing debate over the legalization of marijuana and the challenges of state-federal law conflicts. It remains uncertain whether the Supreme Court will accept the case or how it will ultimately be resolved.
