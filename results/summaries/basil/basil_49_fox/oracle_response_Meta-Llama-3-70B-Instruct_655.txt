SUMMARY:

Colorado's top law enforcement official is defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma challenged its constitutionality. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's law, which allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21, violates federal law and therefore undermines their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado-grown marijuana is "heavily trafficked" into his state, straining finances and legal systems. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from marijuana sales, while Nebraska taxpayers bear the cost.

Colorado Attorney General John Suthers calls the lawsuit "without merit," saying it stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit fails to provide statistics to support its claims, and law enforcement agencies have only anecdotal evidence of the impacts of Colorado's legal weed.

The Supreme Court may or may not accept the case, which exists in a "legal no-man's-land." Legal scholars and advocates argue that the lawsuit is "political grandstanding" without merit, and that Colorado voters have made their choice clear. END OF SUMMARY.
