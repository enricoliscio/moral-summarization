Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Colorado's marijuana law being challenged by neighboring states. Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it's unconstitutional because the drug is flowing into their states, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, saying it's constitutional and that the lawsuit lacks merit. There's also mention of federal laws and the state's revenue from marijuana sales.

Now, I need to identify the key moral terms from the list provided. Words like "flowing," "violates," "trump," "merit," "nonenforcement," "flows," "undermining," "efforts," "enforce," "trafficked," "failing," "ban," "violations," "failed," "impacts," "headed," "overdue," "jump," "exist."

I'll structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating the challenge from Nebraska and Oklahoma, using "flowing" and "undermining." Then mention the lawsuit's claim that it violates the Constitution. Colorado's attorney general responds, saying it's without merit. I'll note the financial impacts and the federal aspect, using "nonenforcement" and "trafficked." Also, include the state's revenue and the moral stance of both sides, using "overdue" and "exist."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points are covered. I'll avoid adding any new moral terms not in the list. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legal marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning accused Colorado of failing to enforce federal drug laws, while Colorado counters that the lawsuit lacks merit. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes from marijuana sales, but Oklahoma and Nebraska argue that the drug's trafficking has strained their legal systems and finances. Federal law enforcement priorities require states to keep marijuana within their borders, a claim Oklahoma and Nebraska say Colorado has failed to meet. Legal scholars note the case exists in a legal no-man's-land, with uncertainty about how the Supreme Court will handle it. Colorado's Gov. John Hickenlooper expressed doubt that a lawsuit is the most constructive approach, while advocates argue the challenge is political grandstanding. The moral framing highlights the conflict between state sovereignty, federal law enforcement, and the impacts of Colorado's marijuana policy on neighboring states. END OF SUMMARY.
