Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific instructions on how to approach this. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about Colorado's legalization of marijuana and the legal challenges from neighboring states. The article mentions that Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado, claiming that the state's law is unconstitutional because it allows marijuana to flow into their states, which violates federal laws.

The user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "defends," "challenges," "Promise," "vigorously," "unconstitutional," "concern," "flows," "grievance," "non-enforcement," "reap," "bear," "cost," "fails," "frustrated," "oath," "enforce," "challenge," "merit," "grandstanding," "wrong," "history," "passed," "experiment," "surprise," "no-man's-land," "unusual," "plans," "join," "opportunity," "potential," "precedent," "states' rights," "sovereignty," "federal overreach," "public safety," "tax revenue," "economic growth," "public health," "criminal justice," "inequalities," "reform," "progress," "opportunity," "potential," "precedent," "states' rights," "sovereignty," "federal overreach," "public safety," "tax revenue," "economic growth," "public health," "criminal justice," "inequalities," "reform," "progress," "opportunity," "potential," "precedent," "states' rights," "sovereignty," "federal overreach," "public safety," "tax revenue," "economic growth," "public health," "criminal justice," "inequalities," "reform," "progress."

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and capture the essence of the article while highlighting the moral aspects.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Colorado's legalization, the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, the arguments on both sides, and the implications. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing.

I should check that the summary flows well and includes the key moral arguments without being too verbose. Also, I need to ensure that the summary ends with "END OF SUMMARY." and that it's properly formatted as per the user's instructions.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the identified words where appropriate. I'll keep each sentence focused and ensure the moral framing is preserved throughout.

**SUMMARY:**  
Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to vigorously defend the state's legalization of marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law violates federal marijuana bans and the Constitution's supremacy clause, causing marijuana to flow into neighboring states. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for reaping millions in tax revenue while burdening other states with enforcement costs. Colorado counters that the lawsuit lacks merit, as it reflects federal non-enforcement rather than state choice. Legal scholars note the case is unprecedented, with states suing each other over marijuana. Critics view the lawsuit as political grandstanding, while supporters argue it addresses public safety and federal overreach. The outcome could set a precedent for states' rights and sovereignty in legalizing marijuana. END OF SUMMARY.
