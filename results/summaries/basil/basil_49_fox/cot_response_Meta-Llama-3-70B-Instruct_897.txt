SUMMARY:
Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma challenged its constitutionality. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's pot is freely flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning blames Colorado for not preventing the flow of "contraband" into his state, saying it's a "grievance" that Nebraska taxpayers have to bear the cost. However, Suthers argues that the lawsuit is without merit, stemming from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes from medical and recreational marijuana, while Nebraska and Oklahoma claim it's straining their finances and legal systems. The lawsuit is seen as "grandstanding" by some, and it's unclear how the Supreme Court will handle the case. END OF SUMMARY.
