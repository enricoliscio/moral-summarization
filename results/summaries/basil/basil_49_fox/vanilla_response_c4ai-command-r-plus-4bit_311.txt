SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to declare its marijuana legalization law unconstitutional. The two states argue that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into their states, undermining their own anti-marijuana laws and causing financial strain. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has dismissed the lawsuit as without merit, stating that the primary issue is with the non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana. The lawsuit has been characterized as "political grandstanding" by legalization advocates, who argue that it goes against the will of Colorado voters and the trend towards legalization in other states. Law enforcement in neighboring states claim that Colorado marijuana is extra potent and worth more in their regions, creating incentives for illegal trafficking. Colorado has raised significant revenue from marijuana sales, while Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that they are bearing the costs of increased arrests, impounded vehicles, and other problems related to Colorado pot. The Supreme Court's handling of the case remains uncertain.
END OF SUMMARY.
