Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about Colorado's top cop defending the state's marijuana law after neighboring states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, filed a lawsuit. They want the Supreme Court to declare Colorado's law unconstitutional because they say it's causing marijuana to flow into their states, which violates federal law. 

Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, says the lawsuit lacks merit and is more about federal enforcement issues than Colorado's state law. The states argue that Colorado's marijuana sales are straining their resources and legal systems. 

The article mentions that Colorado has made over $60 million from marijuana taxes and that there's an increase in seizures of Colorado marijuana in other states. However, there's no concrete data on how much is leaving Colorado. 

The U.S. Justice Department has stated they can't enforce all federal marijuana laws, but Colorado hasn't met their priorities, like keeping marijuana within the state. Legal scholars are uncertain how the Supreme Court will handle this unusual case, with some questioning its merit. Colorado's governor thinks the lawsuit isn't the best approach, and supporters see it as political theater.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the main points: the lawsuit, Colorado's defense, financial impact, lack of data, federal priorities, and expert opinions.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, defends the state's 2012 marijuana legalization law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues Colorado's marijuana flows into neighboring states, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances and legal systems. Suthers dismisses the lawsuit, stating it focuses on federal enforcement issues rather than Colorado's state law. Colorado has generated over $60 million in marijuana-related revenue, while neighboring states report increased seizures of Colorado marijuana. However, there's no concrete data on the extent of cross-border flow. The U.S. Justice Department has prioritized federal enforcement but lacks resources to enforce all violations. Legal scholars doubt the lawsuit's merit, noting it's unusual for states to sue each other. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and supporters view the lawsuit as political theater, with Amendment 64 author Brian Vicente calling it "without merit." END OF SUMMARY.
