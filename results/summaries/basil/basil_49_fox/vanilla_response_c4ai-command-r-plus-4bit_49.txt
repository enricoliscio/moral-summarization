SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to declare its marijuana legalization law unconstitutional. The neighboring states argue that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into their states, undermining their own anti-marijuana laws and causing financial strain. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has vowed to defend the law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws. Law enforcement agencies claim that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal marijuana, with increased arrests and drug seizures. However, there are no statistics to support the claim that Colorado marijuana is heavily trafficked into neighboring states. Legal scholars say the outcome of the case is uncertain, and it remains to be seen if other states will join the lawsuit. Supporters of Colorado's law argue that the challenge is political grandstanding and that the federal government has allowed states to experiment with legalization.
END OF SUMMARY.
