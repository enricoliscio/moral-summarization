SUMMARY: Colorado's top law enforcement official vows to vigorously defend the state's pot law after Nebraska and Oklahoma challenge its constitutionality, arguing that the drug is flowing freely into their states. The complaint alleges that the measure violates the Constitution's supremacy clause by running afoul of federal law. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismisses the lawsuit as meritless, pointing to the root cause of non-enforcement of federal laws by neighboring states. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning claims that Colorado marijuana is heavily trafficked into Nebraska, straining their finances and legal systems. Law enforcement agencies in neighboring states have long anecdotally reported the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, but the exact amount of legal pot leaving Colorado remains unknown. The lawsuit, which does not provide supporting statistics, has been criticized as political grandstanding by legalization advocates. Legal scholars say the outcome of the case is uncertain, and it remains to be seen if other states will join the suit. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper expresses a willingness to address the concerns of neighboring states through constructive dialogue rather than litigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
