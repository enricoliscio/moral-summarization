SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the state's law legalizing marijuana. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law violates the Constitution's supremacy clause as it contradicts federal law that bans the drug. Despite Colorado's efforts to regulate and tax the sale of marijuana, neighboring states argue that it has caused negative consequences for them, including increased criminal activity and financial strain. The lawsuit also criticizes the U.S. Attorney General for failing to enforce federal law. Colorado's Attorney General has vowed to defend the state's law, stating that the concerns of neighboring states are due to the non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit has raised questions about the role of states' rights and federal enforcement in the legalization of marijuana, with legal scholars noting the unusual nature of a state suing another state over this issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
