Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I need to go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "defends," "challenges," "unconstitutional," "flows," "approve," "grievance," "undermining," "reaps," "bear," "cost," "failing," "oath," "frustrated," "wrong," "history," "merit," "grandstanding," "opportunity," and "opportunity." These words seem to carry moral weight because they imply right or wrong actions, responsibilities, or consequences.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so I'll focus on the conflicts, responsibilities, and the stances taken by the states and officials involved.

I should structure the summary to include Colorado's defense of its marijuana law, the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, the arguments about federal law supremacy, the financial impacts, and the opinions from various officials. I'll make sure to incorporate the identified moral words to maintain the original tone and framing.

I also need to keep the summary clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. It's important to highlight the key points: Colorado's stance, the lawsuit's claims, the financial aspects, and the broader implications of state versus federal law.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and effectively captures the moral framing as per the user's instructions. Making sure that all the important elements are included without being too verbose.

**SUMMARY:**  
Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legal marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances and legal systems. Colorado has reaped over $60 million in taxes from marijuana sales, while Nebraska and Oklahoma claim they bear the cost of increased law enforcement and arrests. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized the federal government for failing to enforce marijuana bans, while Colorado officials and legal scholars argue the lawsuit lacks merit and is political grandstanding. The case highlights the tension between state and federal laws, with Colorado asserting its right to legalize marijuana and neighboring states frustrated by the spillover effects. The lawsuit's outcome remains uncertain, but it underscores the broader debate over state sovereignty and federal authority. END OF SUMMARY.
