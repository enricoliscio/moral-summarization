Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Colorado's Attorney General is defending their marijuana law against lawsuits from Nebraska and Oklahoma. These states argue that Colorado's law violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. They claim that marijuana is flowing into their states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. 

I should identify the key morally framed words from the list provided: flowing, violates, trump, merit, nonenforcement, flows, undermining, efforts, enforce, trafficked, failing, ban, violations, failed, impacts, headed, overdue, jump, exist. I need to incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include the main points: Colorado's defense, the lawsuit's claims, the impact on neighboring states, and the reactions from various officials. I'll make sure to use the moral words to convey the framing, like "flowing," "undermining," "violate," etc.

I'll start by stating Colorado's stance, then the lawsuit's arguments, followed by the impacts and reactions. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay under 200 words. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly.

Finally, I'll review the summary to check that it includes the morally framed words and accurately reflects the article's content. Making sure it's clear and concise while preserving the author's moral perspective is crucial.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for reaping profits while forcing neighboring states to bear the costs of enforcement. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales, which began in January. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's marijuana sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems, with police spending more resources on marijuana-related issues. However, Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as lacking merit, stating it primarily concerns federal law nonenforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved policy. Legal experts note the case is unusual, as states rarely sue each other, and its outcome is uncertain. Colorado advocates, like legalization proponent Brian Vicente, argue the lawsuit is political grandstanding, with no merit given the widespread adoption of medical marijuana laws全国23个州已经通过了医用大麻法律，没有一个因为联邦法律而被推翻。END OF SUMMARY.
