SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma are challenging Colorado's law legalizing marijuana, claiming that it undermines their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws and violates the Constitution's supremacy clause. Colorado's top law enforcement official vows to defend the law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance of the neighboring states stems from the non-enforcement of federal laws, rather than the choice made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit highlights the financial and legal strain on Nebraska and Oklahoma due to increased arrests, housing inmates, impounding vehicles, and other issues related to Colorado marijuana. It also blames the U.S. Attorney General for failing to enforce the federal ban on drugs. Legal scholars note the unusual nature of a state suing another state and question the Supreme Court's response. Colorado's governor expresses his belief that a lawsuit is not the most constructive way to address concerns. The challenge is seen by some as political grandstanding, with the legalization advocate stating that it shows the neighboring states are on the wrong side of history.
END OF SUMMARY.
