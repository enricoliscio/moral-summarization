Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Colorado defending its marijuana law against challenges from Nebraska and Oklahoma. 

First, I need to understand the main points. Colorado's Attorney General is defending the law, saying it's constitutional. The neighboring states argue that Colorado's legalization leads to marijuana flowing into their states, affecting their enforcement efforts and finances. 

I should highlight the moral arguments. Colorado's stance is about state sovereignty and voter choice, while the plaintiffs are concerned about federal law supremacy and the impact on their states. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Colorado's defense, mention the lawsuit details, the arguments from both sides, and the legal scholars' perspectives. 

I should ensure that the summary includes the key moral points: state vs. federal laws, the impact on neighboring states, and the debate over legal merits and political motivations. 

I'll structure it by introducing the situation, the arguments from each side, the consequences, and the reactions from Colorado officials and legal experts. 

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the required tokens and keep the language clear and objective, reflecting the moral framing without bias.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's 2012 marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The neighboring states argue that Colorado's legal marijuana is flowing into their jurisdictions, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances. Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating it reflects concerns over federal law enforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved policy. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for profiting from marijuana sales while his state bears the costs of enforcement. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes from marijuana sales, which began in January 2014. The lawsuit highlights the tension between state sovereignty and federal law, with legal experts questioning the Supreme Court's potential involvement. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper expressed doubt that litigation is the best approach to resolving the issue. Critics, including legalization advocate Brian Vicente, argue the lawsuit is politically motivated and lacks legal basis. END OF SUMMARY.
