Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Colorado's marijuana law facing challenges from neighboring states. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I need to make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Colorado has legalized marijuana, and Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing, arguing it violates federal law and the Constitution. They claim Colorado's pot is flowing into their states, undermining their laws. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, saying it's constitutional and that the lawsuit lacks merit. The article also mentions the financial impacts and the federal government's stance on enforcement.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words: flowing, violates, trump, merit, nonenforcement, flows, undermining, enforce, trafficked, failing, ban, violations, failed, impacts, headed, overdue, jump, exist.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with Colorado defending its law, then mention the lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma, using "flows" and "undermining." Highlight the arguments about federal law and the Constitution. Include the financial impacts and the federal nonenforcement. Make sure to note Colorado's defense and the moral implications they're emphasizing.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is preserved. I'll make sure each of the key words is included where appropriate without making the summary too wordy. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for reaping millions in taxes while his state bears the costs of enforcing federal bans. Colorado's legal marijuana sales have raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees, but the lawsuit argues that the drug's flow has strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems. Colorado officials dismiss the lawsuit as lacking merit, asserting that the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from federal nonenforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. Federal authorities have acknowledged limited resources to enforce marijuana bans, but states like Colorado must ensure the drug remains in-state. The lawsuit highlights the moral conflict between state and federal laws, with some officials calling the challenge "political grandstanding" and others frustrated by the failure to enforce federal bans. The case raises questions about the future of marijuana regulation and the moral implications of state vs. federal enforcement.  
END OF SUMMARY.
