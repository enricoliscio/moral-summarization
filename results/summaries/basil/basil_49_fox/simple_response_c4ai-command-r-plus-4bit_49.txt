SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the state's legalization of marijuana for recreational use. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law violates the Constitution's supremacy clause as it contradicts federal law, and that the flow of marijuana from Colorado is undermining their own state laws and causing financial strain. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, arguing that the primary issue is with the non-enforcement of federal laws by the U.S. Attorney General. The lawsuit has been criticized as political grandstanding and a moral overreach by Nebraska and Oklahoma, with legal scholars noting the unusual nature of a state suing another state over its internal policies. Colorado's top law enforcement official vows to defend the law, which was approved by voters, despite the legal and moral challenges presented by its neighboring states.
