SUMMARY: Colorado's top law enforcement official vows to vigorously defend the state's historic marijuana legalization law against challenges from neighboring states, Nebraska and Oklahoma. These states filed a lawsuit alleging that Colorado's law runs afoul of federal law and undermines their own anti-marijuana efforts, straining their finances and legal systems. Colorado's Attorney General dismisses the complaint as meritless, arguing that the primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws by the U.S. Attorney General. Law enforcement in Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado marijuana is heavily trafficked into their states, leading to increased arrests and seizures. Despite the moral framing of the issue, legal scholars question the lawsuit's chances of success and suggest that federal leniency allows states to experiment with legalization. The challenge to Colorado's law is seen as political grandstanding by legalization advocates, who argue that it is on the wrong side of history. END OF SUMMARY.
