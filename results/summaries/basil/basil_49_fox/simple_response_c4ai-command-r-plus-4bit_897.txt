SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, arguing that it violates the Constitution's supremacy clause and undermines their own state anti-marijuana laws. Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance of the neighboring states stems from the non-enforcement of federal laws by the U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder. The lawsuit highlights the financial and legal strain on Nebraska and Oklahoma due to increased arrests, incarceration, and other problems related to Colorado's legal marijuana. It also argues that Colorado has failed to keep marijuana in-state as outlined by the U.S. Justice Department. While legal scholars and Colorado officials question the lawsuit's validity and effectiveness, law enforcement agencies in neighboring states argue that Colorado's legal weed is impacting their resources and leading to more marijuana-related crimes. The outcome of this case remains uncertain, but it highlights the ongoing debate and moral dilemma surrounding marijuana legalization in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
