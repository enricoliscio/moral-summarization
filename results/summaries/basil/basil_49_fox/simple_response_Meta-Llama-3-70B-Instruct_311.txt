SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana law against a lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, which claim that the drug is freely flowing into their states and undermining their anti-marijuana laws. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law is unconstitutional and violates the supremacy clause, which prioritizes federal laws over state laws. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit and that the neighboring states' primary grievance stems from the non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit also blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce federal law. Meanwhile, Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from medical and recreational marijuana sales. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case, and some argue that the lawsuit is "political grandstanding" without merit.

END OF SUMMARY.
