Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Colorado's marijuana law and the challenges from neighboring states. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Colorado's top law enforcement official, John Suthers, is defending the state's marijuana legalization law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law is unconstitutional because it violates the supremacy clause, as federal laws take precedence over state laws.

I should note the key points: the states involved (Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma), the nature of the lawsuit (challenging Amendment 64), the arguments from both sides, and the reactions from various officials and experts.

Next, the article explains that Amendment 64, passed in 2012, allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, making it harder for them to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska's attorney general, Jon Bruning, mentions that Colorado is profiting while Nebraska's taxpayers bear the costs.

Colorado's Attorney General Suthers dismisses the lawsuit, stating it lacks merit. He points out that the issue is more about federal law enforcement not being enforced rather than Colorado's state law. The article also mentions that Colorado has raised over $60 million from marijuana taxes and fees.

The lawsuit argues that Colorado's sales have strained the finances and legal systems of Nebraska and Oklahoma, with police spending more resources on marijuana-related issues. Bruning criticizes U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for not enforcing federal drug laws in Colorado.

The U.S. Justice Department had previously stated they don't have the resources to enforce all federal marijuana violations, setting out eight priorities for states to follow if they legalize marijuana. One of these is keeping marijuana within the state, which Nebraska and Oklahoma claim Colorado hasn't done.

The article also provides some statistics about increased seizures of Colorado marijuana in other states, though the lawsuit doesn't include specific data. Local law enforcement in Nebraska reports that Colorado's marijuana is more potent, making it more valuable and a bigger target for traffickers.

Colorado's Governor Hickenlooper is skeptical about the lawsuit being the best approach, and legal experts are uncertain how the Supreme Court will handle the case. Some argue that this is a political move without legal basis, especially since other states with medical marijuana laws haven't faced similar challenges.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main elements: the lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma, the arguments on both sides, the financial impact, and the reactions from officials and experts.

I should structure the summary to include:
- The states involved and their actions.
- The legal basis of the lawsuit (supremacy clause, federal vs. state laws).
- Colorado's response and the financial benefits.
- The impact on neighboring states and law enforcement.
- Reactions from Colorado officials and legal scholars.
- The potential implications and uniqueness of the case.

I'll make sure to keep it concise, avoiding unnecessary details, and ensure it flows logically.
