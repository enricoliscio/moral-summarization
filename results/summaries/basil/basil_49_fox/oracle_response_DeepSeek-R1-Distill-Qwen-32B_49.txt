Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Colorado's legalization of marijuana and neighboring states challenging it in court.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. I should identify those words from the list provided. Words like "flowing," "violates," "trump," "merit," etc., are key here.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Colorado's Amendment 64, the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, the arguments on both sides, and the legal implications. I need to ensure that the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral stance presented in the article.

I'll make sure to include the moral framing words in the summary. For example, "flowing" when talking about marijuana moving to neighboring states, "violates" regarding constitutional issues, and "merit" when Colorado defends its stance. I'll also mention the financial and legal impacts, using words like "undermining" and "trafficked."

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between states and the federal government, emphasizing the moral arguments each side presents. Finally, I'll conclude with the legal scholars' perspectives on the case's potential outcome.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it clearly after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for reaping profits while forcing neighboring states to bear the costs of enforcement. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales, which began in January 2014. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado's marijuana sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems, with police spending more resources on marijuana-related issues. Colorado officials, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, argue the lawsuit lacks merit and is not the most constructive way to address concerns. Legal scholars note the case is unprecedented, as states rarely sue each other over such issues. Colorado legalization advocate Brian Vicente called the challenge "political grandstanding," emphasizing that 23 states have medical marijuana laws without federal overturn. The case highlights tensions between state and federal laws, with Colorado asserting its voters' choice while neighboring states argue Colorado's actions violate federal drug bans. END OF SUMMARY.
