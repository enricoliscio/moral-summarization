SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization law unconstitutional, arguing that it has led to increased drug trafficking and strained their states' resources. Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has pledged to defend the law, stating that the lawsuit is without merit and that the primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws. The lawsuit argues that Colorado marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their own laws and causing financial strain. Law enforcement agencies have anecdotally supported this claim, but there are no exact figures on how much legal pot leaves Colorado. The lawsuit also blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce federal marijuana laws. Colorado has raised significant revenue from marijuana sales, and legal scholars say it is unusual for a state to sue another over such a matter. This challenge to Colorado's law is seen as political grandstanding by some, and it remains to be seen whether other neighboring states will join the lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
