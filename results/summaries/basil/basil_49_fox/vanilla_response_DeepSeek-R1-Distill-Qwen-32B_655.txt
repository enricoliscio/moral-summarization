Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Colorado's marijuana law and the legal challenges from neighboring states. Let me read through the article carefully.

The main points are that Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's Amendment 64, which legalized recreational marijuana, is unconstitutional. They claim it violates the supremacy clause because federal laws, which prohibit marijuana, should take precedence over state laws.

Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, is defending the law, saying the lawsuit lacks merit. He points out that the plaintiffs are more concerned about federal laws not being enforced rather than Colorado's voter-approved measure. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into their states, causing financial and legal strains, like increased police costs and more arrests.

Nebraska's Attorney General, Jon Bruning, criticizes the U.S. Attorney General for not enforcing federal laws, while the U.S. Justice Department has stated they don't have the resources to enforce all violations and have set priorities for states, including keeping marijuana within their borders. However, the lawsuit doesn't provide statistics to back up the claims, though some law enforcement agencies anecdotally report increased marijuana-related issues.

Colorado has raised over $60 million from marijuana taxes and fees. The article also mentions that the amount of Colorado marijuana seized in other states has increased, and some law enforcement officials are frustrated because they feel they have to enforce federal laws regardless of state policies.

Colorado's governor, John Hickenlooper, doesn't think the lawsuit is the best approach. Legal scholars are uncertain how the Supreme Court will handle the case, noting it's unusual for states to sue each other. Other neighboring states like Utah and New Mexico aren't joining the lawsuit. A Colorado attorney involved in drafting Amendment 64 calls the lawsuit political and without merit, pointing out that medical marijuana laws in other states haven't been overturned.

So, putting this all together, the summary should include the key points: the lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma, Colorado's defense, the legal arguments based on federal supremacy, the financial impact on Colorado, the lack of supporting statistics in the lawsuit, and the reactions from various officials and legal experts.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court challenging Colorado's 2012 marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as lacking merit, stating it focuses on federal enforcement failures rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. The plaintiffs argue Colorado's marijuana flows into their states, straining their legal and financial systems. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized federal inaction on marijuana enforcement, while the U.S. Justice Department has limited resources and sets enforcement priorities, including keeping marijuana within statesâ€”a claim Colorado disputes. Colorado has generated over $60 million in marijuana-related revenue. Some law enforcement officials report increased marijuana-related issues, though no exact data on legal pot leaving Colorado exists. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper called the lawsuit unconstructive, and legal scholars question its chances in court. Other states, like Utah and New Mexico, have not joined the suit. Colorado legalization advocate Brian Vicente labeled the lawsuit "political grandstanding," noting no medical marijuana laws have been overturned due to federal law. END OF SUMMARY.
