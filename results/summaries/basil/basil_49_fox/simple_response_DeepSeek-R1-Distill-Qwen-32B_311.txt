Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

So, Colorado has legalized marijuana, and neighboring states like Nebraska and Oklahoma are upset because they say it's causing problems for them. They filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, claiming Colorado's law is unconstitutional because it violates federal law. Colorado's attorney general is defending the law, saying it's up to the states to decide, and that the lawsuit isn't valid. 

I should highlight the conflict between state laws and federal laws, emphasizing Colorado's stance on state sovereignty versus the neighboring states' concerns about enforcement and costs. Also, include the financial aspectâ€”Colorado is making money from taxes, while others are spending more on law enforcement. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it reflects the moral arguments presented, like state rights versus federal authority and the impact on neighboring states. I'll structure it to first state the issue, then the lawsuit details, Colorado's defense, the financial aspects, and the legal implications.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has vowed to defend the state's 2012 marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado's legal marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances and legal systems. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales, while Nebraska and Oklahoma argue they are bearing the costs of enforcement. Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating it focuses on federal non-enforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized the federal government for failing to enforce marijuana bans, while Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper expressed doubt that litigation is the best approach. Legal experts note the case is unusual, as states rarely sue each other, and its outcome is uncertain. Colorado legalization advocate Brian Vicente called the lawsuit "political grandstanding," emphasizing that 23 states have medical marijuana laws without federal overturn. END OF SUMMARY.
