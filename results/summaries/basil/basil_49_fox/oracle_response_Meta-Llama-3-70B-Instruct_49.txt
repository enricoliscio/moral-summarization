SUMMARY:

Colorado's top law enforcement official is defending the state's marijuana law after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and undermines their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, straining their finances and legal systems. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning argues that Colorado's law is failing to prevent the trafficking of marijuana into his state, costing taxpayers millions. However, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers says the lawsuit lacks merit, citing the state's voters' decision to legalize recreational marijuana. The lawsuit's success is uncertain, with legal scholars noting that it's unusual for a state to sue another state. Proponents of legalization argue that the challenge is political grandstanding, pointing out that 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws without being overturned. The lawsuit's outcome will have significant implications for the future of marijuana legalization.

END OF SUMMARY.
