SUMMARY:
Colorado's top law enforcement official is defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. The two states claim that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into their states, undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning says that Colorado's "contraband" has been heavily trafficked into his state, and blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce federal law. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes from medical and recreational marijuana, while Nebraska taxpayers have to bear the cost of policing and housing inmates. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers calls the lawsuit "without merit", saying it stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. END OF SUMMARY.
