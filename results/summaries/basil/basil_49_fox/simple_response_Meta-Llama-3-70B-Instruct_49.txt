SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana legalization law against a lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, which claim the law is unconstitutional and allows marijuana to flow into their states. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which prioritizes federal laws over state laws. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit and that the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from the non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, rather than the choices made by Colorado voters. The lawsuit also blames Colorado for straining Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems due to increased marijuana-related arrests and seizures. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case, but many see the lawsuit as "political grandstanding" without merit, as 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws without being overturned.

END OF SUMMARY.
