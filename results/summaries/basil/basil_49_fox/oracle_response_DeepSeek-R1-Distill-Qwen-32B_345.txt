Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Colorado's marijuana law and neighboring states' challenges. They also listed specific morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Colorado's Amendment 64 legalizes recreational marijuana, and Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing, claiming it violates federal law. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, saying it's constitutional. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their enforcement efforts.

I need to include the morally framed words: flowing, violates, trump, merit, nonenforcement, flows, undermining, enforce, trafficked, failing, ban, violations, failed, impacts, headed, overdue, jump, exist. I should make sure these words are used appropriately in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the lawsuit, then Colorado's defense, the impact on neighboring states, the federal perspective, and the legal scholars' opinions. I'll ensure each paragraph is concise and within 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning the lawsuit and the moral framing words like "flows" and "undermining." Then, I'll include Colorado's response using "merit" and "nonenforcement." Next, I'll address the financial and legal impacts on the neighboring states, using "trafficked" and "impacts." I'll also touch on the federal government's stance and the surprise from legal scholars, using "exist" and "overdue."

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is clear, includes all necessary moral terms, and stays within the word limit. I'll review it to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing as per the user's request.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization law, Amendment 64, claiming it violates federal law and undermines their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana policies. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismissed the lawsuit, calling it without merit and attributing the plaintiffs' concerns to federal nonenforcement rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, trafficked in large quantities, and causing financial and legal strains. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized the federal government for failing to enforce marijuana bans, while Colorado has reaped millions in taxes. Federal authorities have prioritized keeping marijuana within state borders, which Oklahoma and Nebraska argue Colorado has failed to do. Law enforcement reports increased marijuana seizures, but exact figures on legal pot leaving Colorado remain unclear. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper expressed skepticism about the lawsuit, and legal scholars noted the case exists in a legal no-man's-land. Critics view the challenge as political grandstanding, with Colorado's legalization advocate arguing it reflects the wrong side of history. END OF SUMMARY.
