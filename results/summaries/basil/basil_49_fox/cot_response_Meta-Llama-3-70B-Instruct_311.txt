SUMMARY:
Colorado's top law enforcement official, Attorney General John Suthers, is defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after neighboring states Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional. The lawsuit argues that Colorado-grown marijuana is freely flowing into neighboring states, undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning blames U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce federal law. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes from medical and recreational marijuana, while Nebraska taxpayers bear the cost of policing the drug. Law enforcement agencies claim they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper believes filing a lawsuit is not the most constructive way to find a solution. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case. END OF SUMMARY.
