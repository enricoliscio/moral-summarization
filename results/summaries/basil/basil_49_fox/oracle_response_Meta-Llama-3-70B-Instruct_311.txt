SUMMARY: Colorado's top law enforcement official is defending the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit claiming it violates federal law and is "flowing" into their states. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado's law is "undermining" their efforts to enforce anti-marijuana laws, and that the drug is being "trafficked" into their states, straining their finances and legal systems. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as "without merit," saying the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from the "non-enforcement" of federal laws regarding marijuana. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's law is "failing" to keep marijuana in-state, and that neighboring states are bearing the cost. However, legal scholars say it's unclear how the Supreme Court might handle the case, and that the lawsuit is "political grandstanding" without merit. END OF SUMMARY.
