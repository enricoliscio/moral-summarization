SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers is defending the state's marijuana law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the law is unconstitutional and allows marijuana to flow into their states. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law, which allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21, violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. However, Suthers believes the lawsuit is without merit, stating that the neighboring states' concerns stem from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than Colorado's voter-approved law.

The lawsuit claims that Colorado's marijuana is straining Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems, but provides no statistics to support this claim. Law enforcement agencies have anecdotally reported feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, but there is no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving the state. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from medical and recreational marijuana.

END OF SUMMARY.
