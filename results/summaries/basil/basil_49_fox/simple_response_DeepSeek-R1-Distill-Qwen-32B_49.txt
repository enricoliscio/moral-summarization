Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Colorado's marijuana law and the challenges from neighboring states. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first.

Alright, the article talks about Colorado's Attorney General defending their pot law after Nebraska and Oklahoma sued them in the Supreme Court. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana, is unconstitutional because it violates the supremacy clause, as federal laws take precedence. The neighboring states argue that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into their states, causing problems and financial strain.

Colorado's AG, John Suthers, says the lawsuit lacks merit and that the main issue is the non-enforcement of federal laws, not Colorado's choice. The lawsuit mentions that Colorado's sales have increased their expenses on law enforcement, like arrests and seizures. Nebraska's AG, Jon Bruning, criticizes the U.S. AG for not enforcing federal laws and blames Colorado for their problems.

The article also mentions that the U.S. Justice Department has stated they can't enforce all marijuana violations and set some priorities, including keeping it in-state. But Nebraska and Oklahoma say Colorado hasn't done that. There's some data about increased seizures, but it's not clear how much legal pot is leaving Colorado.

Colorado's Gov, John Hickenlooper, thinks the lawsuit isn't the best approach. Legal scholars are uncertain how the Supreme Court will handle it, noting it's unusual for states to sue each other. Other states like Utah and New Mexico aren't joining the suit. A Colorado attorney involved in Amendment 64 calls the lawsuit political and without merit, noting that many states have medical marijuana without issues.

So, the moral framing here seems to be about states' rights versus federal law, the impact on neighboring states, and whether Colorado's policy is responsible. The summary should highlight these points.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the key points: the lawsuit, Colorado's defense, the financial and enforcement impacts, the federal vs state issue, and the moral stance on states' rights and responsibility.

Let me structure it: Start with the lawsuit, Colorado's response, the arguments from both sides, the federal stance, and the broader implications. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without going over the word limit.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, include the main players: Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, their AGs, the Governor, and the legal experts' opinions. Highlight the moral aspect by showing how each side views the responsibility and the right to enforce laws.

Wait, the user mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should ensure the summary reflects the moral arguments presented, like the responsibility of Colorado to prevent outflow vs. the states' right to enforce their own laws.

I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to hit all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has defended the state's legalization of marijuana, Amendment 64, after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their anti-marijuana laws and straining their finances and legal systems. Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating it primarily concerns federal law enforcement failures rather than Colorado's voters' decision. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized the U.S. Justice Department for not enforcing federal marijuana bans, while Colorado's Governor, John Hickenlooper, questioned the lawsuit's constructive nature. Legal experts note the case's unusual nature, as states rarely sue each other, and question its chances in court. Colorado has generated over $60 million in marijuana-related revenue, but neighboring states argue it has led to increased enforcement costs and drug trafficking. The lawsuit highlights tensions between states' rights and federal authority, with Colorado's supporters calling it a progressive step, while opponents view it as irresponsible and harmful to others. END OF SUMMARY.
