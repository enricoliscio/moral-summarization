Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Colorado's marijuana laws. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Colorado's top cop is defending their pot law after neighboring states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, challenge it in the Supreme Court. They argue that Colorado's legalization is causing marijuana to flow into their states, which is a problem because they're trying to enforce their own anti-marijuana laws. Colorado's Attorney General says the lawsuit has no merit and that it's more about federal enforcement issues.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key elements: who is involved (Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma), the reason for the lawsuit (marijuana flowing into neighboring states), the response from Colorado, and the implications. Also, there's mention of the financial impact on Colorado versus the costs for Nebraska and Oklahoma. Plus, the federal stance on marijuana enforcement and how Colorado is handling it.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the challenge from the two states, then Colorado's defense. Mention the lawsuit's claims about federal law and the supremacy clause. Highlight the financial aspects and the response from Colorado's officials. Also, include the legal scholars' opinions and the outcome possibilities.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, covering all main points without getting too detailed. Avoiding jargon and keeping it clear for someone who might not be familiar with the legal aspects. 

Let me structure it step by step: introduction of the challenge, Colorado's defense, the lawsuit's arguments, financial impacts, responses from officials, and the legal perspective. That should cover everything succinctly.

SUMMARY: Colorado's Attorney General, John Suthers, has defended the state's 2012 marijuana legalization law (Amendment 64) after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming it violates federal law and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legal marijuana is flowing into neighboring states, undermining their anti-marijuana efforts and straining their finances and legal systems. Suthers dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating it focuses on federal enforcement issues rather than Colorado's voter-approved law. Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning criticized Colorado for profiting from marijuana sales while his state bears enforcement costs. Colorado has generated over $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales. The lawsuit claims Colorado has failed to keep marijuana within its borders, as per federal guidelines. Legal experts note the case is unprecedented, with states suing each other over marijuana, and its outcome is uncertain. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper expressed doubt that litigation is the best solution, while legalization advocates like Amendment 64 co-author Brian Vicente dismissed the lawsuit as politically motivated. END OF SUMMARY.
