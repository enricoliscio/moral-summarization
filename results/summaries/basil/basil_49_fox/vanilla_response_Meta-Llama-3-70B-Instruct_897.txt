SUMMARY:

Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers has vowed to defend the state's marijuana legalization law after Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit with the US Supreme Court, claiming the law is unconstitutional. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's law, which allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21, violates the Constitution's supremacy clause and allows marijuana to flow into neighboring states. Colorado has raised over $60 million in taxes, licenses, and fees from medical and recreational marijuana sales. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado's marijuana is straining their finances and legal systems, but the lawsuit lacks statistics to support this claim. Law enforcement agencies have reported anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, but there is no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case.

END OF SUMMARY.
