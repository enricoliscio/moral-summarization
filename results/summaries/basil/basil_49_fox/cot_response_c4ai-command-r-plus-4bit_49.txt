SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the state's law that legalizes marijuana for recreational use. The neighboring states argue that Colorado's law is unconstitutional as it contradicts federal law and impacts their own efforts to enforce anti-marijuana regulations. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's marijuana flows freely into their states, creating financial and legal burdens. Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers refutes the claims, stating that the lawsuit is without *merit* and that the primary *grievance* stems from non-enforcement of federal laws rather than the choice made by Colorado voters. Nebraska's Attorney General Jon Bruning blames the U.S. Attorney General for failing to enforce federal drug bans, while Colorado officials defend their law and question the need for legal action. Legal scholars note the unusual nature of a state suing another and express doubts about the Supreme Court's willingness to hear the case. The challenge to Colorado's marijuana law highlights the ongoing debate over federal versus state authority in legalization and the potential for interstate legal conflicts.
