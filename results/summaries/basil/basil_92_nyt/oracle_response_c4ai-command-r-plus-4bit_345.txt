SUMMARY: A report by BuzzFeed News alleging that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project has sparked reactions from Congress members and the President himself. The report suggests that Trump may have committed obstruction of justice and pressured a witness to commit perjury. However, the Special Counsel's office has disputed the accuracy of the report, and the White House has denied the allegations. Despite this, BuzzFeed News stands by its reporting. The House Intelligence Committee is investigating the allegations and plans to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. If true, the allegations could lead to impeachment proceedings against the President. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump and his interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The investigation revealed that Trump has tried to conceal details of these interactions from senior administration officials. Meanwhile, Cohen, who was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes, claimed that he acted out of loyalty to Trump.
