SUMMARY: On Friday, the special counsel's office disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report led to calls for impeachment proceedings, but the special counsel's spokesman called the description of statements and characterization of documents "not accurate." The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting. The statement by the special counsel's spokesman was unusual as it publicly challenged a widely-discussed news media account. The article alleged that Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, which would be a damning revelation in the investigation into Russia's sabotage efforts and could be key to an obstruction of justice case. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, with questions about the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump and his concealment of interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's involvement in the Moscow project continued during his presidential campaign, and Cohen admitted to lying to Congress about the length of negotiations and Trump's involvement. Cohen will testify again before the Senate Intelligence Committee in early February. The rare public statement by the special counsel's office raises questions about the accuracy of the report and the potential for impeachment proceedings.
END OF SUMMARY.
