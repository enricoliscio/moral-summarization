SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleged that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project during the 2016 election. The special counsel's office, led by Robert Mueller, issued a rare public statement disputing the accuracy of the report. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the allegations, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it "categorically false." BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting. The report prompted reactions from Congress, with some calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations were true. The House Intelligence Committee chairman, Adam Schiff, said his panel would investigate the report. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about the FBI's investigation into Trump and his interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mueller's office previously revealed that Cohen had lied to Congress about the Moscow project negotiations and Trump's involvement. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other charges. He said he acted out of loyalty to Trump.
