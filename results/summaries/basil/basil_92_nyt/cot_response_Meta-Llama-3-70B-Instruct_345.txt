SUMMARY:
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report sparked a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, it could be grounds for impeachment. However, the special counsel's office stated that the report was "not accurate." The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report, calling it "categorically false." The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has revealed that Cohen repeatedly lied to Congress about the project, and that Trump had tried to conceal details about his interactions with Russian officials. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, with Democrats calling for further investigation and even impeachment if the allegations are true. END OF SUMMARY.
