SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report sparked a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, it could be grounds for impeachment. However, Mueller's office challenged the report, stating that it was "not accurate." The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report. The investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election has revealed that Cohen lied to Congress about the length of negotiations and Trump's involvement in the project. If Trump did pressure Cohen to lie, it would be a damning revelation and could be a cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice. The moral implication is that Trump's actions, if true, would be a grave abuse of power and a threat to the integrity of the justice system.

END OF SUMMARY.
