Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper project. The key points are:

1. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, says BuzzFeed's report is inaccurate regarding Cohen's testimony.
2. TheBuzzFeed report caused a stir, with some Congress members suggesting impeachment if true.
3. Trump and the White House denied the allegations, calling the report "categorically false."
4. The article mentions that Cohen initially lied to Congress but later corrected himself, providing credible information.
5. There's also mention of Cohen's sentencing and his statement about loyalty to Trump.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral implications, such as the potential obstruction of justice and the credibility of Cohen's testimony. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Let me outline the summary:

- Start with Mueller's refutation of the BuzzFeed report.
- Mention the implications if true (impeachment, obstruction of justice).
- Note the White House's denial and the ongoing congressional investigation.
- Highlight Cohen's initial lies and subsequent corrections, his loyalty to Trump.
- Conclude with the ongoing investigation and the potential consequences.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward, focusing on the moral aspects like truthfulness, justice, and the impact on Trump's presidency.
