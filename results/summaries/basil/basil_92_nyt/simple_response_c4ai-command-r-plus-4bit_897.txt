SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleging that President Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project has sparked strong reactions in Congress, with some calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations are true. The Special Counsel's office, led by Robert Mueller, has disputed BuzzFeed's report, stating that their description of statements and documents is inaccurate. The report led to a flurry of responses, including from the President, who called the Special Counsel's statement a "great day for our Country." The allegations, if true, would be a significant revelation in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and could constitute obstruction of justice. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, while the Special Counsel's spokesman's statement is unusual in publicly challenging a media account. The House Intelligence Committee is investigating the report and will seek additional witness testimony and documents. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about FBI investigations into the President's dealings with Russia. The implications of the allegations are serious, and the truth of the matter remains to be determined.
