SUMMARY: On Friday, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller issued a rare public statement disputing a BuzzFeed News report claiming that President Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow real estate project during the 2016 election. The report, which has not been confirmed by other news outlets, led to calls for impeachment by some members of Congress. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterizations of documents were "not accurate." The BuzzFeed report alleged that Cohen told Mueller's team that Trump had pressured him to lie, but a person familiar with Cohen's testimony denied this claim. The statement by Mueller's office was unusual as it publicly challenged a widely-discussed media account. The White House and Trump's lawyers vehemently denied the BuzzFeed report. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting and urged Mueller to clarify his dispute. This incident adds to the ongoing questions about Trump's Russia-related dealings and potential obstruction of justice. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said the committee would investigate the BuzzFeed report and that the allegations, if true, would constitute subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
