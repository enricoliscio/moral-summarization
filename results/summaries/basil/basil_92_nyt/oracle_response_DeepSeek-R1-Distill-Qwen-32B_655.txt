Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the special counsel challenging a BuzzFeed report that President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal. The report suggests Trump directed Cohen to commit perjury, which is a serious issue regarding obstruction of justice and possible impeachment.

I need to include words like "investigating," "report," "description," "pressure," "perjury," "sabotage," "subornation," "obstruction," "justice," "resign," "impeached," "conceal," "lied," "lying," "statements," "violations," "crimes," "deception," "used," "sentenced," "led," "choose," "crime," "testify."

I should structure the summary to cover the key points: the special counsel's challenge of the report, the potential implications for Trump, Cohen's role, and the reactions from Congress and the White House. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to frame the actions as wrong or unethical.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral language without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed a BuzzFeed report claiming President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal. The report suggested Trump directed Cohen to commit perjury, which could constitute obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury. The special counsel's spokesman, Peter Carr, denied the accuracy of BuzzFeed's account, while the White House and Trump's lawyers called the report "categorically false." If proven, the allegations could lead to impeachment proceedings. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, initially concealed his interactions with Russian officials but later provided truthful information. His actions were driven by blind loyalty to Trump. The investigation highlights potential violations of justice and ethical standards, with Congress vowing to probe further. END OF SUMMARY.
