SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleged that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow during the 2016 election. The report led to calls for impeachment proceedings, but was disputed by the special counsel's office, which stated that the description and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate." Despite this, BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about FBI counterintelligence investigations into Trump's interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In December, prosecutors revealed that Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress about the length of negotiations and Trump's involvement in the project. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations, and financial crimes. He stated that he acted out of loyalty to Trump, who he felt led him down a "path of darkness." The potential implications of the allegations in the BuzzFeed report, if true, could be grounds for impeachment or resignation, according to some members of Congress. The House Intelligence Committee is investigating the report and expects Cohen to testify again in early February.
END OF SUMMARY.
