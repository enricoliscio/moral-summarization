SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report by BuzzFeed News that President Trump had directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report alleged that Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, which would be a damning revelation of obstruction of justice. However, Mueller's office stated that the report's description and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report, calling it "categorically false." The allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about recent revelations that FBI counterintelligence agents began investigating Trump in 2017 and that Trump has tried to conceal details about his interactions with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.
