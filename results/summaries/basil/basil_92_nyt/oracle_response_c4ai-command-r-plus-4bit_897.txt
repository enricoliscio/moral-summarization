SUMMARY: A report by BuzzFeed News alleging that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project drew strong reactions from Congress members, who suggested that the allegations, if true, could warrant impeachment proceedings. However, the Special Counsel's office disputed BuzzFeed's characterization of the specific statements and documents related to Cohen's testimony. The report sparked concerns about possible obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury by the President. The House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate the allegations further, while BuzzFeed stands by its reporting. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump's ties with Russia and the President's efforts to conceal details of his interactions with Vladimir Putin. Separately, prosecutors described Cohen's pattern of deception and greed, driven by loyalty to Trump, leading to his sentence of three years in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes. The potential implications of the President coaching a witness to testify falsely were also discussed during William Barr's nomination hearing for Attorney General.
END OF SUMMARY.
