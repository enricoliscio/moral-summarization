SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The special counsel's office, led by Robert Mueller, publicly disputed BuzzFeed's report, stating that their description of specific statements and characterizations of documents were not accurate. The BuzzFeed report led to strong reactions from Congress, with some members suggesting that if true, the allegations could be grounds for impeachment proceedings against the President. The report also added to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about FBI investigations into Trump's interactions with Russia and his attempts to conceal details from administration officials. In court filings, Mueller's team described how Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress about the length and extent of the Moscow project negotiations. Cohen later admitted to lying and said he did so out of blind loyalty to Trump. The White House and Trump's lawyers vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report, calling it categorically false. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and urged the special counsel to clarify their statement. The special counsel's spokesman's challenge to the media account was unusual. The article highlights the potential moral and legal implications of the allegations, including obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury. The House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate the report further. END OF SUMMARY.
