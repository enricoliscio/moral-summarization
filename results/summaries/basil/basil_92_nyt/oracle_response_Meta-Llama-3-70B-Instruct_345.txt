SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report alleged that Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, which would be a damning revelation in the investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. However, Mueller's office stated that the report's description and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. The White House and Trump's lawyers also vigorously denied the report. If true, the allegations would constitute subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice, which could be grounds for impeachment. The House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate the report and secure additional witness testimony and documents. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about recent revelations that FBI agents began investigating Trump in 2017 and that Trump tried to conceal details about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
