SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report sparked outrage among senior members of Congress, who said that if true, it could be grounds for impeachment. However, the special counsel's office challenged the report's accuracy, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and documents obtained by the office were not accurate. The president himself responded, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!" The incident raises questions about the president's potential obstruction of justice and highlights the ongoing investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election.
