Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those words where possible. 

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out the words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "interference," "directed," "lie," "pressure," "perjury," "damning," "obstructed justice," "deny," "false," "subornation," "impeachment," "resign," "chaotic," "conceal," "opportunities," "deception," "deceptive," "darkness," "crime," "obstruction," and "statute." These words are all charged with moral implications, so I need to make sure they're included in the summary.

Now, moving on to the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, highlighting the key points while using the identified moral terms. The main points are the Buzzfeed report about Trump directing Cohen to lie, the special counsel's denial, the potential for impeachment, Cohen's previous lies, Trump's defense, and the broader implications of the investigation.

I should start by introducing the Buzzfeed report and the denial. Then mention the possible impeachment, Cohen's history of lying, Trump's response, and the ongoing investigation. I need to ensure that each sentence flows logically and includes the moral terms where appropriate without making the summary too convoluted.

I also need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. The summary should reflect the moral framing by emphasizing the implications of Trump's actions, such as obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury. I should also note the reactions from Congress and the White House, as well as the broader context of the Mueller investigation.

I think I've covered all the key points. Now, I'll structure the summary to include each of these elements, making sure to use the moral terms identified earlier. I'll aim for a coherent flow that starts with the Buzzfeed report, moves to the denial, then the implications, and ends with the ongoing investigation and its significance.

**SUMMARY:**
The Buzzfeed report alleged that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal, which could constitute obstruction of justice or subornation of perjury. The special counsel's office denied the claims, calling Buzzfeed's account "not accurate." If true, the allegations could lead to impeachment proceedings. Cohen previously lied to Congress about the deal's timeline and Trump's involvement, though he later corrected himself. Trump defended his actions, stating he was considering future business opportunities. The investigation highlights potential moral and legal implications, including the concealment of interactions with Russian officials and the broader context of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
