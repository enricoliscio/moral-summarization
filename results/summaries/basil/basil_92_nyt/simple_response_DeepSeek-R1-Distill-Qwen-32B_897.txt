Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral implications.

The article is about a report by BuzzFeed News that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper deal. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, through his spokesman, Peter Carr, disputed the accuracy of BuzzFeed's report. The article also mentions reactions from Congress, including possible impeachment proceedings if the allegations are true. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report, calling it "categorically false." BuzzFeed stood by their reporting. The article also provides background on Cohen's previous lies to Congress and his guilty plea, as well as Mueller's statements about Cohen's credibility.

The moral framing here seems to center around truthfulness, obstruction of justice, and the integrity of the political process. TheBuzzFeed report suggests that Trump pressured Cohen to lie, which would be a serious ethical and legal issue. The denial from the White House and Trump's lawyers adds to the tension, questioning the credibility of the media and the investigation. The potential for impeachment adds a high stakes moral dimension, as it's about the highest form of accountability for a president's actions.

I need to capture these elements in the summary. I'll focus on the key points: the BuzzFeed report, the denial by Mueller's office, the possible impeachment, the background on Cohen's previous lies, and the broader implications for justice and political integrity.

I should make sure to include the moral implications without bias, just reflecting the author's framing. So, the summary should mention the allegations, the denial, the possible consequences, and the context of Cohen's past actions.

Let me structure this concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with the report, then the denial, the reactions, the background on Cohen, and the broader implications. I'll ensure that the moral framing is clear, such as the potential for obstruction of justice and the impact on public trust.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and captures all necessary points while preserving the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleged that President Trump pressured his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper deal, a claim the special counsel's office denied. If true, the allegations could constitute obstruction of justice and perjury, potentially leading to impeachment. Cohen previously lied to Congress about the deal's timeline and Trump's involvement, later admitting he concealed interactions with Russian officials to support Trump's messaging. Mueller's office stated Cohen corrected his testimony and provided credible information. The White House and Trump's lawyers dismissed the report as "categorically false," while Congress vowed to investigate. The case highlights issues of truthfulness, justice, and accountability in political conduct. END OF SUMMARY.
