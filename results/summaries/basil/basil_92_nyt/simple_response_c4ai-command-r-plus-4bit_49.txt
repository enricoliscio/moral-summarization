SUMMARY: On Friday, the office of special counsel Robert Mueller disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The BuzzFeed report suggested that Trump may have pressured Cohen to commit perjury, leading to calls for impeachment proceedings. However, Mueller's spokesman called the report inaccurate, marking a rare public challenge to a media account. While BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, the statement from Mueller's office drew attention as it appeared to be the first time the office publicly disputed a widely-discussed media revelation about the president. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about FBI investigations into Trump's Russia interactions and his attempts to conceal details from top officials. The incident also raised concerns about Cohen's congressional testimony, which was drafted with input from Trump's lawyers. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations, and financial crimes. He expressed remorse and blamed his actions on his loyalty to Trump. This incident underscores the importance of upholding truth and accountability, even in the face of potential obstruction of justice by the highest office in the land.
END OF SUMMARY.
