SUMMARY:
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report that President Trump directed Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The rare public statement challenged the facts of the article, calling it "categorically false". The report led to a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The president himself responded on Twitter, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!" A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017.
