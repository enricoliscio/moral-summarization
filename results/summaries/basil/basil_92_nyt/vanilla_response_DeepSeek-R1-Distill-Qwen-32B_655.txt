Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper project. 

So, the key points are: 

1. BuzzFeed reported that Cohen told prosecutors he was pressured by Trump before his testimony.
2. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, said the BuzzFeed report was inaccurate.
3. Trump responded on Twitter, calling it a great day for the country.
4. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report, calling it "categorically false."
5. BuzzFeed stood by their report, saying their sources were accurate.
6. This is unusual because Mueller's office rarely comments on media reports.
7. Congress is reacting, with some members considering impeachment if the allegations are true.
8. Cohen's testimony and his role in the Moscow project are central to the investigation.
9. Cohen had previously lied to Congress but later corrected himself, providing useful info.
10. Trump's lawyers saw Cohen's testimony before he delivered it, which could indicate coordination.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the dispute, theBuzzFeed report, Mueller's response, Trump's reaction, the denial, and the implications for Congress. Also, include Cohen's role and the fact that Mueller's office is rarely commenting publicly.

Let me structure it: Start with the dispute, mention theBuzzFeed report, Mueller's denial, Trump's response, the White House's denial, BuzzFeed's stance, the unusual nature of Mueller's statement, and the potential consequences like impeachment. Then, briefly touch on Cohen's previous lies and the fact that Trump's lawyers saw his testimony beforehand.

I should make sure to keep it concise and include all the main points without getting too detailed. Also, use clear and straightforward language.
