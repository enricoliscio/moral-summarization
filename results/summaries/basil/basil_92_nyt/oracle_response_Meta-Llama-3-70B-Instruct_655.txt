SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report by BuzzFeed News that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report sparked outrage, with senior members of Congress calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations were true. However, Mueller's office stated that the report's "description of specific statements to the special counsel's office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate." The president himself responded, calling it "a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!" If true, the allegations would constitute "subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice." Cohen had previously lied to Congress about the project, and Mueller's office described him as "driven by greed" and having "repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends." The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about recent revelations of FBI investigations into Trump's interactions with Russian officials.

END OF SUMMARY.
