SUMMARY: The special counsel's office disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report alleged that Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, which would be a damning revelation in the investigation into Russia's sabotage of the 2016 election. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it "categorically false." BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting. The statement by the special counsel's spokesman was unusual as it publicly challenged a widely-discussed news report. The article sparked reactions from Congress members, who stated that if true, the allegations could initiate impeachment proceedings or warrant the president's resignation. Representative Adam Schiff said the House Intelligence Committee would investigate the report, while Senator Mark Warner said the panel expected Cohen to testify again in early February. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump and his concealment of interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The article also revealed details about Cohen's previous false statements to Congress and prosecutors, his sentencing, and his claim that he acted out of loyalty to Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
