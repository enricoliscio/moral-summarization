Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal. 

So, the key points are: Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, said BuzzFeed's report wasn't accurate. The report suggested Trump pressured Cohen to lie, which could be grounds for impeachment. Trump responded on Twitter, calling it a great day for the country. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report. BuzzFeed stood by their story. Mueller's office rarely comments, so this was unusual. 

Cohen had previously lied to Congress about the deal's timeline and Trump's involvement. He later corrected himself. Schiff and others in Congress are looking into the report. The article also mentions Cohen's guilty plea and his explanation about lying to support Trump. Trump defended his actions, saying he might not have won, so he wanted to keep business options open. Cohen's lawyers were involved in preparing his testimony. 

I should include all these elements in the summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it by stating Mueller's denial, theBuzzFeed report's implications, reactions from Trump and Congress, Cohen's previous statements, and the ongoing investigation. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed.
