SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report by BuzzFeed News that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report sparked a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, the allegations could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. However, the special counsel's office challenged the facts of the report, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate." The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report. The incident highlights the gravity of the situation, as a proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be a damning revelation in the investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election.
