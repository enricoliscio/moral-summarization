SUMMARY: The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report by BuzzFeed News that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report sparked outrage, with senior members of Congress calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations were true. However, the special counsel's office challenged the report, stating that the description and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report, calling it "categorically false." The report's allegations, if true, would constitute obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury, which could be grounds for impeachment. The incident adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about recent revelations that FBI agents began investigating Trump in 2017 and that Trump has tried to conceal details about his interactions with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. END OF SUMMARY.
