SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported that President Trump directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about a skyscraper project in Moscow. This report led to calls for impeachment from senior members of Congress, as subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice. However, the special counsel's office disputed BuzzFeed's report, stating that their description of specific statements and characterization of documents were inaccurate. The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report, while BuzzFeed maintained its accuracy. This incident adds to a chaotic week for the White House, with revelations about FBI investigations into Trump's interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Separately, federal prosecutors described Cohen's pattern of deception throughout his professional life, driven by greed and loyalty to Trump. This incident raises serious moral and legal questions about the president's conduct and potential obstruction of justice.
