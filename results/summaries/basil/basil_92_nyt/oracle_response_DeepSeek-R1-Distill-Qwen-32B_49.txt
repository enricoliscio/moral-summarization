Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I should include. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, called the report inaccurate. TheBuzzFeed report led to possible impeachment discussions, but the White House denied it. Cohen had previously lied to Congress about the deal's timeline and Trump's involvement, but later corrected his statements. Mueller's office found Cohen credible after he corrected himself. Cohen was sentenced to three years for lying and other crimes. The article also mentions William Barr's comments on obstruction of justice.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary using as many of the provided moral terms as possible. I should include words like investigating, report, description, perjury, sabotage, obstruction, justice, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key moral issues: the potential pressure from Trump, Cohen's lies, the implications for obstruction of justice, and the ongoing investigation.

I'll start by stating Mueller's dispute of the report, mention theBuzzFeed's claims and their implications. Then, I'll note the denials and Cohen's previous lies. Finally, I'll touch on the sentencing and the legal implications, including Barr's comments.

Let me make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the moral framing words without being too technical. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed report alleging President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. The report suggested Trump may have committed obstruction of justice, a serious moral and legal issue. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, called the report's description and characterization inaccurate, while the White House denied the claims, labeling them "categorically false." Cohen, who previously lied to Congress about the deal's timeline and Trump's involvement, later corrected his statements, proving credible to Mueller's office. Cohen was sentenced to three years for perjury, campaign finance violations, and financial crimes. The allegations, if true, could constitute subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice, potentially leading to impeachment proceedings. Mueller's office emphasized Cohen's initial lies and his later truthful testimony, highlighting the moral and legal implications of the case. END OF SUMMARY.
