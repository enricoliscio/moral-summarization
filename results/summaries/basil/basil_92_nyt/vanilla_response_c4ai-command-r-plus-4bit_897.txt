SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleged that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report led to calls for impeachment proceedings by some members of Congress. However, the special counsel's office disputed the accuracy of the report, specifically regarding the characterization of documents and testimony related to Cohen's congressional testimony. The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the allegations. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting, while the New York Times has not independently confirmed the report. The House Intelligence Committee is investigating the allegations and plans to secure additional witness testimony and documents. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about FBI investigations into Trump's dealings with Russia. The special counsel's office previously revealed that Cohen had lied to Congress about the length and extent of negotiations for the Moscow project. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations, and financial crimes.
END OF SUMMARY.
