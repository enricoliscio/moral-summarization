SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleged that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report caused a stir in Congress, with some members suggesting impeachment proceedings if true. The Special Counsel's office, led by Robert Mueller, disputed the report's accuracy. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about FBI investigations into Trump's Russia ties and his interactions with Vladimir Putin. The report also shed light on Cohen's previous false statements to Congress about the Moscow project and his motivations for lying. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other charges. The potential implications of the allegations and the ongoing investigations into Trump's conduct are significant.
END OF SUMMARY.
