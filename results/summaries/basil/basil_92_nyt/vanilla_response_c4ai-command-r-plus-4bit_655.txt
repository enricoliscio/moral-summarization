SUMMARY: On Friday, the office of special counsel Robert Mueller disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming that President Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, prompting reactions from Congress members about possible impeachment proceedings. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report, and Mueller's spokesman called the description of statements to the special counsel's office inaccurate. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting, but Mueller's office maintained that the characterization of documents and testimony was incorrect. The incident marked a rare public challenge by Mueller's office to a media account. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about FBI investigations into Trump's ties with Russia and his interactions with Vladimir Putin. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and the Moscow deal. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Cohen would testify again in early February. The focus now shifts to further scrutiny of Trump's actions and possible consequences.
END OF SUMMARY.
