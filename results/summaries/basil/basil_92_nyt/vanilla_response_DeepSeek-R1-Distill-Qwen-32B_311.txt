Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal. 

I need to figure out the key elements: who, what, when, where, why. The main actors are Mueller, BuzzFeed, Trump, Cohen. The event is the dispute over the report. The implications include potential impeachment talks and the legal aspects of perjury and obstruction of justice.

I should also note the reactions from Congress, the White House's denial, and the context of Mueller's investigation. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I have to be selective about what to include. I'll focus on the main claims, the denial, the congressional reactions, and the significance of the allegations.

I should structure it in a way that first states the dispute, then theBuzzFeed's claims, Mueller's response, the implications, and the reactions from both sides. Also, mention that the New York Times hasn't confirmed the report yet.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and captures all the essential points without getting bogged down in too many details. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed report claiming President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. The report alleged Cohen told prosecutors he was pressured by Trump before his testimony. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, stated BuzzFeed's account was inaccurate. The report sparked calls for impeachment from Congress members, but Trump and the White House denied the claims, calling them "categorically false." BuzzFeed defended its reporting. The allegations, if true, could constitute obstruction of justice and perjury. Mueller's office said Cohen initially lied but later corrected himself, providing credible information. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and was sentenced to three years in prison. The report added to ongoing scrutiny of Trump's interactions with Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
