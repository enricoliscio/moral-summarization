Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump pressured his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower project. The article mentions the potential for impeachment and the reactions from Congress and the White House. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: Mueller's statement, the BuzzFeed report's claims, the potential legal implications like obstruction of justice, and the reactions from both sides. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”so I should highlight the ethical issues involved, like the pressure to commit perjury and the implications for Trump's integrity.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me outline the main points: Mueller disputes the report, the report's claims about Trump pressuring Cohen, the possible impeachment, the White House's denial, and the broader context of the investigation. I need to make sure the summary flows logically and includes all these elements without getting too detailed.

Wait, I should also mention that the New York Times hasn't confirmed the report yet. That adds context about the credibility of the BuzzFeed story. Including that will show that the situation is still unfolding and under investigation.

Putting it all together, I'll start by stating Mueller's dispute, then the BuzzFeed claims, the possible impeachment, the White House's denial, the potential legal issues, and the ongoing investigation. I'll make sure to keep each sentence clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I think I've covered all the necessary points without exceeding the limit. The summary should accurately reflect the article's content and the moral implications as presented.

SUMMARY: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed report claiming President Trump pressured his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. The report suggested Trump may have obstructed justice, a serious charge in the Russia investigation. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, denied the accuracy of BuzzFeed's account, while the White House and Trump's lawyers called the report "categorically false." Congressional leaders, including Rep. Adam Schiff, vowed to investigate the allegations, which, if true, could lead to impeachment proceedings. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, initially misled investigators but later provided credible information. The report added to the week's chaos for the White House, which is also facing questions about Trump's interactions with Russia. Mueller's office emphasized Cohen's eventual cooperation, though Cohen admitted to lying to protect Trump. The situation highlights ethical concerns about truthfulness and justice in the ongoing investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
