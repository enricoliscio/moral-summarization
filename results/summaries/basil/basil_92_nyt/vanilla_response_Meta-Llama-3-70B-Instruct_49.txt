SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The rare public statement by Mueller's office challenged the facts of the article, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate." The report had sparked reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, the allegations could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump. The president and the White House also denied the report. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting, urging Mueller's office to clarify what it was disputing. The controversy adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about recent revelations on Trump's interactions with Russian officials.
