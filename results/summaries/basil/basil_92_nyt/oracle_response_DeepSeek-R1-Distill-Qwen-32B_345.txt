Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump pressured his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal.

The user wants the summary to include as many morally charged words as possible from the list provided. I should make sure to use words like "investigating," "report," "perjury," "obstruction," "justice," "impeachment," "conceal," "lied," "sabotage," etc. 

I'll start by identifying the key events: the BuzzFeed report's claims, the special counsel's refutation, the political reactions, and the implications for Trump. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.

I should structure the summary to first state what the report alleged, then the denial from Mueller's office, followed by the political reactions and potential consequences. I'll make sure to include the moral terms to reflect the framing. Also, I need to mention Cohen's previous lies and Trump's defense to add context.

Let me draft a few sentences, ensuring I include the moral language. I'll check that each sentence captures a key point without exceeding the word limit. Finally, I'll review to ensure the summary flows logically and maintains the moral tone intended by the author.

SUMMARY: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed report alleging that President Trump pressured his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. The report claimed Cohen told prosecutors he was pressured by Trump before his testimony, which could constitute obstruction of justice or subornation of perjury. Mueller’s spokesman, Peter Carr, stated BuzzFeed’s description of Cohen’s testimony was inaccurate. Senior members of Congress, including Adam Schiff and Joaquin Castro, called for an investigation, with some suggesting impeachment if the allegations were true. The White House and Trump’s lawyers denied the report, calling it "categorically false." Cohen, who previously lied to Congress, later corrected himself during Mueller’s investigation, admitting he concealed interactions with Russian officials to support Trump’s political messaging. The report added to ongoing scrutiny of Trump’s actions, including potential concealment of interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mueller’s office emphasized Cohen’s initial lies and subsequent truthful statements, while Trump defended his business dealings, claiming he might have pursued the deal if he hadn’t won the presidency. The allegations highlight concerns about truthfulness, justice, and potential obstruction of the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
