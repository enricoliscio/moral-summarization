SUMMARY:
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress about his role in Moscow skyscraper negotiations. The rare public statement challenged the facts of the article, calling it "categorically false". The report had sparked a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, the allegations could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The president himself responded, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!" A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be a damning revelation, and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice. The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations. END OF SUMMARY.
