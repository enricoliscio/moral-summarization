SUMMARY:
The special counsel's office disputed a report that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The rare public statement challenged the facts of the article, calling it "categorically false." The report led to a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, it could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. The president himself responded on Twitter, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!" Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony, which would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.
