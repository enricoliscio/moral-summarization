Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report. The report claimed that President Trump told his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper project. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, said the report's facts were inaccurate. 

BuzzFeed's article suggested Cohen told prosecutors he was pressured by Trump before his testimony. This caused a stir, with some Congress members talking about impeachment if true. Trump himself responded on Twitter, calling it a great day for the country. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report, calling it "categorically false." 

BuzzFeed stood by their report, and there's mention that the New York Times hasn't confirmed it yet. A source close to Cohen's testimony said he didn't claim Trump pressured him. Schiff and others in Congress are looking into it, considering it as obstruction of justice. 

The article also mentions Cohen's guilty plea for lying to Congress, Mueller's statements about Cohen's credibility, and the implications if Trump pressured Cohen. Plus, Barr's comment during his nomination about obstruction of justice.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Mueller disputing BuzzFeed's report, the implications for Trump, reactions from Congress, and the context of Cohen's testimony and Mueller's findings.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Mueller's statement, then BuzzFeed's claims and reactions, then the denial from Trump and the White House. Mention the possible impeachment talk. Include the context about Cohen's lies and Mueller's assessment of his credibility. Also, note the potential obstruction charge if true. 

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I go.
