SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report by BuzzFeed News claiming that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report alleged that Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, which would be a damning revelation of obstruction of justice. However, Mueller's office stated that the report's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. The White House and Trump's lawyers also vigorously denied the report. If true, the allegations would constitute subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice, leading to calls for Trump's resignation or impeachment. The investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election continues, with Cohen set to testify privately in early February. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about recent revelations of Trump's interactions with Russian officials.
