SUMMARY: The special counsel's office disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report alleged that Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, which would be a damning revelation in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The White House and Trump's lawyers vigorously denied the report, with the special counsel's spokesman challenging the accuracy of BuzzFeed's characterization of documents and testimony. BuzzFeed maintained its reporting was accurate. The report led to calls for impeachment from Congress, with investigations into the matter already underway. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about FBI counterintelligence investigations into Trump and his attempts to conceal details of interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The article highlights Trump's involvement in the Moscow project, which continued during his presidential campaign, and Cohen's initial lies to Congress about the project's duration and Trump's involvement. Cohen later admitted to lying and was sentenced to prison, expressing blind loyalty to Trump as his motivation. The potential implications of the report, if true, are significant, raising questions of subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
