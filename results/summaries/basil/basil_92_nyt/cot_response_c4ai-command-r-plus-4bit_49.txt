SUMMARY: A rare public statement from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The report suggested that Trump pressured a witness to commit perjury, which could be grounds for impeachment proceedings. The White House and Trump's lawyers vigorously denied the report, with the special counsel's spokesman calling it "not accurate." BuzzFeed News maintained its accuracy, but Mueller's office stated that the characterization of documents and testimony was inaccurate. The incident caused a flurry of reactions from Congress, with some calling for impeachment if the allegations were true. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, already facing questions about FBI investigations into Trump's Russia interactions. The special counsel's office previously revealed that Cohen had lied to Congress about the Moscow project, stating that he did so out of blind loyalty to Trump and to support his political messaging. The incident raises questions of obstruction of justice and perjury. The moral implications of these actions are significant, with words like "deception," "false," and "damning" being used to describe the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
