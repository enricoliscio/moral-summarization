Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about the special counsel disputing a BuzzFeed report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. Words like "directed," "lie," "pressure," "perjury," "damning," "obstruction of justice," "categorically false," "deception," "deceptive," "darkness," "crime," "deceit," and "deceptive" stand out as morally framed terms.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating that the special counsel disputed the report, then mention the BuzzFeed report's claims. I'll include the reactions from Congress and Trump's response. I should note the potential for impeachment and the legal implications. Also, I'll mention Cohen's guilty plea and his statements about Trump. Finally, I'll wrap it up with the ongoing investigation and the significance of the allegations.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral framing.

**Moral Framing Summary:**

The special counsel, Robert Mueller, refuted a BuzzFeed report alleging that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower project. The report suggested Trump pressured Cohen to commit perjury, a serious accusation that could imply obstruction of justice. Mueller's office denied the claims, calling them "categorically false," while BuzzFeed maintained their story's accuracy. Congressional leaders, including Adam Schiff and Joaquin Castro, expressed intent to investigate, with some suggesting impeachment if the allegations held. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, initially misled authorities but later corrected his statements, showing a departure from his pattern of deceit. The case highlights the moral implications of deception and the potential for legal consequences, underscoring the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's actions.
