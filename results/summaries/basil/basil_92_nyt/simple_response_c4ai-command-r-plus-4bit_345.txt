SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleging that President Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project sparked reactions from Congress members, who suggested that if true, it could be grounds for impeachment. The special counsel's office disputed the report, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents were "not accurate." The report led to discussions about impeachment or resignation, with some representatives calling for further investigations. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, already facing questions about the FBI's investigation into Trump's Russia interactions. While BuzzFeed maintained its accuracy, the special counsel's spokesman challenged the facts. The implications of the allegations, if true, could be damning for the president, possibly constituting obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury. The rare public statement by the special counsel's office drew attention, as it appeared to be the first time they publicly challenged a news media account. The accuracy of the report remains unclear, with one source disputing Cohen's alleged statement about Trump pressuring him to lie. The House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate the report further, highlighting the potential legal and moral implications.
END OF SUMMARY.
