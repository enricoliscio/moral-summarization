Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided and keep the summary under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal. The article mentions potential impeachment, obstruction of justice, and other legal terms. 

I need to identify the key elements: the dispute over the report, the implications for Trump, Cohen's role, and the reactions from Congress and the White House. I should use words like "investigating," "report," "pressure," "perjury," "obstruction," "justice," "impeached," "conceal," "lied," etc., as per the user's list.

I'll structure the summary to include the main parties involved, the nature of the report, the denial from Mueller's office, the potential legal implications, and the reactions from Congress. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me start drafting: mention Mueller's office disputing the report, the claim that Trump pressured Cohen to lie, the denial from both Mueller and the White House, the potential for impeachment, and the context of Cohen's previous lies and Mueller's findings.

I should also include that the New York Times hasn't confirmed the report and that Cohen's initial lies were corrected later. Additionally, mention the broader implications for Trump's conduct and the ongoing investigations.

Now, I'll put it all together, making sure to include the moral framing words and keep it under 200 words. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY: The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed report claiming President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony was inaccurate. The report, if true, could constitute obstruction of justice and perjury, potentially leading to impeachment proceedings. The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the allegations, calling them "categorically false." Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, initially misled investigators but later corrected his statements, providing credible information about his interactions with Trump. Mueller's office emphasized Cohen's eventual truthfulness. The report added to the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's conduct, including allegations of concealing interactions with Russian officials. Congressional committees are investigating the claims, with Democrats like Adam Schiff and Joaquin Castro emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations. Trump's lawyers and Mueller's office have denied the BuzzFeed report, while the New York Times has not independently confirmed it. The investigation continues to examine Trump's actions and potential violations of justice. END OF SUMMARY.
