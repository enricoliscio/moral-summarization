Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputing a BuzzFeed report that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper deal. The spokesman for Mueller said BuzzFeed's account wasn't accurate. This is a key point because it challenges the credibility of the report.

BuzzFeed's report suggested Cohen was pressured by Trump, which could lead to impeachment. The article mentions that if true, it would be a serious issue, possibly obstruction of justice. This highlights the moral implications, as lying to Congress is a serious offense.

The White House and Trump's lawyers denied the report, calling it "categorically false." This shows the ongoing conflict and the stakes involved. The fact that Mueller's office is involved adds weight to the situation, as it's part of the Russia investigation.

Congress is reacting, with Schiff and others planning to investigate. This indicates the political and legal ramifications. Cohen's previous lies to Congress and Mueller's findings about his credibility are important details. Cohen initially lied but later corrected himself, showing some cooperation, but his past behavior is still under scrutiny.

The article also mentions Trump's defense of his business interests and Cohen's loyalty. This adds context about their relationship and possible motives.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Mueller's denial, BuzzFeed's report, potential impeachment, Trump's denial, Cohen's previous lies, and the ongoing investigation.

I should make sure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the implications of lying and obstruction of justice. I'll structure the summary to flow from the report to the denials, the investigation, and the broader context.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's concise and within the limit.
