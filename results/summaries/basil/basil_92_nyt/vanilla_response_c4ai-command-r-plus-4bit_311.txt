SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper deal during the 2016 election. The report led to calls for impeachment proceedings, but the special counsel's office disputed the accuracy of the report. The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the allegations. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which faced questions about FBI investigations into Trump's Russia ties and his interactions with Vladimir Putin. The report also revealed that Cohen had lied to Congress about the length and extent of the Moscow project negotiations. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations, and financial crimes. The House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate the BuzzFeed report and the Moscow deal.
