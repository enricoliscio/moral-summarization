SUMMARY: A BuzzFeed News report alleging that President Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project, has sparked intense reactions from Congress members and the White House. The report suggests that if true, it could be grounds for impeachment proceedings against Trump. The Special Counsel's office, led by Robert Mueller, has publicly disputed key elements of the BuzzFeed story, stating that their characterization of documents and testimony is inaccurate. BuzzFeed, however, stands by its reporting. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, already facing questions about the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump's ties with Russia and his attempts to conceal details of interactions with Vladimir Putin. The article also reveals how Cohen initially lied to Congress and Mueller's team about the duration and extent of the Moscow project negotiations but later corrected himself, providing useful information. The moral framing of the story revolves around words like "disputed," "allegations," "false," "obstruction," "deception," "credible," and "truthfulness."
