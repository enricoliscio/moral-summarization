SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert Mueller, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The report sparked outrage, with some lawmakers calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations were true. However, Mueller's office stated that the report's description of specific statements and documents obtained by the office were "not accurate." The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report. The controversy highlights the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice by Trump. The moral implications are clear: if true, Trump's actions would constitute subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice, which would be a grave breach of trust and a threat to the rule of law.

END OF SUMMARY.
