SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. The rare public statement challenged the report's facts, stating that Cohen did not tell prosecutors about being pressured by the president. The report had sparked impeachment calls from senior Democrats, but the White House and Trump's lawyers denied the allegations. BuzzFeed maintained that its report was accurate, urging the special counsel to clarify what he was disputing. The statement marked a rare instance of the special counsel publicly challenging a news report. The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election continues, with Cohen set to testify privately in early February.

END OF SUMMARY.
