SUMMARY:

The special counsel's office disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about his role in Moscow skyscraper negotiations. The rare public statement challenged the report's facts, saying it was "not accurate." The report had sparked calls for impeachment proceedings against Trump, but the White House and Trump's lawyers denied the allegations. Cohen had previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the negotiations. The special counsel's office said Cohen did not state that Trump pressured him to lie to Congress. The House Intelligence Committee will investigate the report, and if true, the allegations could constitute obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury.

END OF SUMMARY.
