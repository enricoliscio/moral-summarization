SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in Moscow skyscraper negotiations. Mueller's office stated that the report's characterization of documents and testimony was "not accurate." The report had sparked reactions from senior members of Congress, who said the allegations could be grounds for impeachment proceedings. The White House and Trump's lawyers also denied the report. BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting, urging Mueller's office to clarify what they were disputing. The House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate the report, and if true, the allegations could constitute subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
