SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a report by BuzzFeed News that claimed President Trump had directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The report sparked a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, the allegations could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. However, the special counsel's office challenged the facts of the report, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by the office were not accurate. The president himself responded, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!" The report's allegations, if true, would be a damning revelation of obstruction of justice and could be the cornerstone of a case against the president.

END OF SUMMARY.
