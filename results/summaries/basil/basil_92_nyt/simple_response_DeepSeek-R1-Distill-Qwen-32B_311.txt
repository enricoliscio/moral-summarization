Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, specifically focusing on claims that Trump pressured Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal. 

First, I need to identify the key points. The special counsel's office denied BuzzFeed's report, which suggested Trump directed Cohen to lie. This is a serious accusation because if true, it could lead to impeachment. The article mentions reactions from Congress, the White House, and others, including Cohen's previous lies and Mueller's findings.

I should make sure the summary highlights the moral implications. The denial by Mueller's office is crucial because it's a rare public statement. Also, the potential for obstruction of justice and impeachment are significant moral issues. I need to include the reactions from both sidesâ€”Democrats pushing for impeachment and the White House dismissing the claims as false.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the essence without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by stating the denial, the implications, reactions, and the ongoing investigation. That way, the moral framing about truthfulness and potential obstruction is clear.

Let me draft it: Start with the denial, mention the accusation's severity, include the special counsel's statement, then the reactions from Congress and the White House. Conclude with the investigation's continuation. Make sure to stay within the word limit and maintain the moral angle throughout.

SUMMARY: The special counsel's office, led by Robert Mueller, denied BuzzFeed's report claiming President Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal. The denial came amid concerns that such an accusation could lead to impeachment proceedings. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's account of Cohen's testimony was inaccurate. The White House and Trump's lawyers also dismissed the report as "categorically false." Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, initially misled investigators but later corrected his statements. His testimony revealed discrepancies in the timeline of the Moscow deal and Trump's involvement. The investigation into Russian interference and potential obstruction of justice continues, with Congress vowing to probe further. END OF SUMMARY.
