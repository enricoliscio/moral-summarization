SUMMARY:

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The rare public statement challenged the facts of the article, which led to a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress who said the allegations could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The president and the White House also denied the report, calling it "categorically false." BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting, urging the special counsel to clarify what he was disputing. The statement was unusual, as it was the first time the special counsel's office had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account.

END OF SUMMARY.
