SUMMARY:
The special counsel's office disputed a BuzzFeed News report claiming that President Trump directed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. The report sparked a flurry of reactions from senior members of Congress, who said that if true, it could be grounds for impeachment. The president and the White House vehemently denied the report, calling it "categorically false" and a "very sad day for journalism." However, the report's editor stood by the story, urging the special counsel to clarify what he was disputing. The allegations, if true, would constitute "subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice," according to Representative Adam Schiff. The report added to a chaotic week for the White House, which has faced questions about the president's interactions with Russian officials and his attempts to conceal details from senior administration officials. Cohen had previously lied to Congress about the deal, driven by "greed" and a desire to support Trump's "political messaging." END OF SUMMARY.
