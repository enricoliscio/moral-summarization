SUMMARY: Robert Mueller's office has publicly *disputed* a BuzzFeed report claiming that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Moscow skyscraper project. While BuzzFeed has *maintained* the accuracy of its reporting, Mueller's spokesman called the story "not accurate." The report sparked a *flurry* of *reactions* from Congress, with some suggesting that the allegations, if *proven* true, could be grounds for impeachment. The White House and Trump's lawyers have *vigorous*ly denied the report, calling it "categorically *false*." The statement by Mueller's office is *unusual*, as it publicly *challenged* a news story that had garnered significant attention. The article raises questions about potential *obstruction* of *justice*, and whether Trump *subornation*ed perjury. The president's involvement in the Moscow project and his *interactions* with Vladimir Putin have also been under scrutiny. The report adds to a chaotic week for the White House, as it faces questions about the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump and his attempts to *conceal* *details* of his *interactions* with Putin. The special counsel's office previously revealed that Cohen had *repeatedly* *lied* to Congress about the Moscow project and that he *repeatedly* *used* his *power* and *influence* for *deceptive* ends. Cohen was *sentenced* to three years in prison for *lying* to Congress, *violations* of campaign finance laws, and *financial* *crimes*. He took *full* *responsibility* for his *crimes*, saying he acted out of *blind* *loyalty* to Trump, who *led* him down a "path of *darkness* over light." END OF SUMMARY.
