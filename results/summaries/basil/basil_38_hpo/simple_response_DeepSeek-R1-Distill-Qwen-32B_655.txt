Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury's decision on same-sex couples' taxes. The user wants a concise summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are that the Treasury now recognizes same-sex marriages for federal taxes regardless of the state they live in. This is a significant step post-DOMA repeal. It affects various tax areas like filing status, benefits, and penalties. Edie Windsor's case is mentioned as a catalyst, and there's mention of the political progress for the LGBT community.

I should highlight the moral aspects, such as equality and justice. The author emphasizes the unfairness before this ruling, so I need to include that. Also, the impact on same-sex couples moving between states is important.

I'll structure the summary to start with the announcement, mention the DOMA context, explain the new policy, and touch on the implications and reactions, especially from Edie Windsor. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's clear and concise.

Let me make sure to include all the key elements without getting too detailed. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language straightforward. Also, I'll ensure that the moral framing is evident, showing the positive change in equality and justice for same-sex couples.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it flows well and covers all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they reside in. This decision, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), ensures equality under federal tax law for legally married same-sex couples nationwide. Previously, the IRS did not recognize such marriages due to DOMA, but this new policy now prioritizes the state where the couple was married over their current state of residence. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasized that this ruling provides clarity and fairness, allowing same-sex couples to access federal benefits and protections, such as tax credits and estate tax relief, while also subjecting them to the "marriage penalty." The policy applies only to legally married couples, not domestic partnerships. This move marks a significant step toward equality, as it addresses the discriminatory impact of DOMA, which Edie Windsor famously challenged after being forced to pay estate taxes following her wife's death. The ruling has been praised as a victory for justice and fairness for the LGBT community. END OF SUMMARY.
