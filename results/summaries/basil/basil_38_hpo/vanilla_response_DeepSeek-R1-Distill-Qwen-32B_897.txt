Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury's decision regarding same-sex couples and taxes. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that the Treasury announced they'll recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes, even if the couple lives in a state that doesn't recognize it. This is because of the Supreme Court overturning DOMA. Before, the IRS didn't recognize these marriages because of DOMA's section 3. Now, the state where the wedding took place matters more than where they live for federal taxes.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew says this provides clarity and benefits for same-sex couples, allowing them to move without worrying about their tax status. The policy was discussed with LGBT advocates and has political significance because DOMA was challenged due to the tax burden on same-sex couples. Edie Windsor's case is mentioned as an example where she had to pay estate taxes, which wouldn't have happened if she were heterosexual.

The new policy applies to all federal tax areas, including filing status, benefits, and credits, but it doesn't affect domestic partnerships. Same-sex couples might also face the marriage penalty now. The Human Rights Campaign's president, Chad Griffin, supports this decision, saying it treats gay and lesbian couples equally under tax laws.

Other agencies under Obama have also extended benefits to same-sex couples in non-recognizing states. Edie Windsor approves of the policy, calling it the remedy she sought when challenging DOMA.

Now, to summarize this concisely. I need to include the main points: the Treasury's decision, the reason behind it (DOMA overturn), the impact on couples living in non-recognizing states, the benefits and potential marriage penalty, and the significance of the ruling. Also, mention Edie Windsor's case and the broader support from other agencies.

I should structure the summary to start with the announcement, explain the change from DOMA, the effect on tax filing, mention the benefits and any drawbacks, and conclude with the positive reception and broader implications.

Let me make sure I don't exceed 200 words and keep it clear and concise. I'll need to condense each point without losing essential information.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state of residence, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This decision ensures that same-sex couples married in states that recognize their union will have their marriages acknowledged for tax filing, even if they reside in states that do not. The policy, led by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, provides clarity and equal access to federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections, such as filing status, employee benefits, and estate taxes. However, it also subjects same-sex couples to the "marriage penalty," where joint filers may face higher taxes. The ruling, which applies only to legally married couples, is seen as a significant step toward equality, with Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, praising the decision. Other federal agencies have also extended benefits to same-sex couples, reflecting broader support for LGBTQ+ rights under the Obama administration. 

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury has decided to recognize same-sex marriages for federal taxes, regardless of residency, post-DOMA overturn. This ensures couples married in states that recognize their unions receive tax benefits and protections, though they may face the marriage penalty. The ruling, supported by advocates, marks a step toward equality, with Edie Windsor applauding it as a remedy for DOMA's discrimination. Other agencies have also extended benefits to same-sex couples. END OF SUMMARY.
