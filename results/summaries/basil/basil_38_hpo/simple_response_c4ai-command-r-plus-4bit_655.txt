SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department announced a major victory for equality in taxation by recognizing same-sex marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state's position. This decision corrects a long-standing injustice where same-sex couples were burdened by unfair tax laws, as highlighted by the case of Edie Windsor, who faced a substantial tax bill after her wife's death. The new policy ensures uniform recognition of same-sex marriages across the nation, providing access to benefits and protections that all Americans deserve. Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign celebrates this move as a step towards equality, granting same-sex couples the crucial tax benefits and protections they rightfully deserve. The Treasury's decision is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to extend federal benefits to same-sex couples, even in states that refuse to recognize their marriages. This announcement is a testament to the power of advocacy and a significant step forward in the fight for LGBT rights and moral equality.
