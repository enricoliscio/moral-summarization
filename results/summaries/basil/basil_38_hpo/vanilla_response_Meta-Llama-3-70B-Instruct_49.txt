SUMMARY:

The US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision follows the US Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new policy means that same-sex couples will be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residency. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and estate taxes. This decision marks a significant step forward for the LGBT community, providing access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under DOMA. The policy only applies to married couples, not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions. This move is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to extend federal benefits to gay couples in states that don't recognize their marriages.
