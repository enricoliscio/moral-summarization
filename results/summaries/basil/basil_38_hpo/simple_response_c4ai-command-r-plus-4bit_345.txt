SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision is a significant step forward for LGBT rights and was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new policy ensures that all legally married same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law and no longer face discrimination. It provides certainty and clear guidance for couples, allowing them to access the same benefits, responsibilities, and protections as heterosexual married couples. The Treasury's decision also recognizes the unfair burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, which was the catalyst for the legal challenge to DOMA. Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, was forced to pay estate taxes after the death of her wife, a burden heterosexual couples do not face. The new policy ensures that all federal tax provisions will apply equally to same-sex couples, including filing status, employee benefits, and tax credits. This move by the Treasury is the latest in a series of LGBT-inclusive policies implemented by the Obama administration, ensuring equal rights and recognition for all Americans.
