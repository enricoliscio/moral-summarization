SUMMARY:
The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision, prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. The new policy ensures that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home. This means they will have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under DOMA. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and estate taxes. Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, hailed the decision as the precise remedy she sought when she challenged the constitutionality of DOMA. END OF SUMMARY.
