SUMMARY:
The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision marks significant progress for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, providing certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. The new policy ensures that same-sex couples will have access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country, knowing that their federal filing status will not change. The decision is a crucial step towards equality, ending the discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples under the Defense of Marriage Act. END OF SUMMARY.
