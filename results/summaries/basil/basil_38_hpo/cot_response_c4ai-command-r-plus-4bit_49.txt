SUMMARY:
The U.S. Treasury Department announced a major step forward in the celebration of same-sex marriages. In a decision prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, the Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared that the federal government will now recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state of residency. This decision provides same-sex couples with justice and equality in federal tax filing, ensuring recognition of their marital status and access to crucial benefits and protections previously denied to them under DOMA's discriminatory provisions. Lew highlighted the certainty, clarity, and coherence of the new policy, emphasizing that all legally married couples deserve equal treatment under federal tax law. The Human Rights Campaign also applauded the move, stating that gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally and have access to benefits that were once unfairly withheld. This ruling, along with similar actions taken by other federal agencies, marks significant political progress towards ensuring that same-sex couples are no longer subjected to discriminatory treatment and are instead recognized with the benefits, responsibilities, and protections they justly deserve.
