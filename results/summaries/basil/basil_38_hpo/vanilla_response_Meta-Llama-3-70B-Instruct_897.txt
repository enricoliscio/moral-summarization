SUMMARY:

The US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision follows the US Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new policy means that same-sex couples who were married in a state that recognizes their marriage will be treated as married for federal tax purposes, even if they move to a state that doesn't recognize their marriage. This provides certainty and access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and income taxes. This decision marks a significant step forward for the LGBT community, providing equal treatment under federal tax laws regardless of where they live.
