SUMMARY:

The US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision follows the US Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new policy means that same-sex couples who were married in a state that recognizes their marriage will be treated as married for federal tax purposes, even if they move to a state that does not recognize their marriage. This ruling provides certainty and clear tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, and assures them that their federal filing status will not change if they move to a different state. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and income, gift, and estate taxes.
