SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department ruled Thursday that same-sex married couples will be recognized for tax purposes, even if their state of residence does not recognize their marriage. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples, assuring them that they will be treated equally under federal tax law, regardless of where they live. The decision was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and marks a significant step forward for LGBT rights. The Treasury Secretary, Jacob Lew, stated that the ruling provides access to benefits, protections, and responsibilities that all Americans deserve. This policy will apply to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and tax credits. The ruling also means that same-sex couples will now be subject to the "marriage penalty," where some joint filers face a higher tax burden than they would as single people. The decision only applies to married couples and was hailed by LGBT advocates as a crucial step toward equality, assuring that same-sex couples will no longer be denied benefits and protections under federal law.
END OF SUMMARY.
