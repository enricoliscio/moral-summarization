SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department announced that it will recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the couple's state of residency. This decision marks a significant political progress for the LGBT community and was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn DOMA. The new policy ensures equality, access, and fairness for same-sex married couples in terms of federal tax laws and benefits. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the policy provides certainty, clear and coherent tax filing guidance, and access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections that all Americans deserve. This ruling assures committed and loving same-sex couples of their rights and protections as they move throughout the country. The policy also subjects gay couples to the so-called marriage penalty. The Treasury's actions are part of a series of LGBT-friendly policies offered by the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling, with other agencies also extending federal benefits to same-sex couples in states that do not recognize their marriages. The decision is hailed as a victory for equality and a crucial step towards ending discrimination against LGBT individuals and their families.
