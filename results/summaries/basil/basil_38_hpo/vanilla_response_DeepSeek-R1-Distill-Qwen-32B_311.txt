Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision regarding same-sex couples' taxes. The article is a bit long, so I'll start by reading through it to get the main points.

First, the key information is that the Treasury announced that same-sex marriages will be recognized for federal taxes regardless of the state they live in. This is because of the Supreme Court overturning DOMA. Before, the IRS didn't recognize same-sex marriages due to DOMA, but now they will, based on where the marriage was celebrated, not where they reside.

The article mentions that this policy change provides clarity and equal treatment under tax laws. It also affects various tax aspects like filing status, benefits, and credits. However, it also notes that same-sex couples might face the marriage penalty, which is a higher tax burden for some couples filing jointly.

Additionally, the article talks about Edie Windsor's case, which was pivotal in challenging DOMA, and how this new policy is the remedy she sought. It also mentions that other federal agencies are extending benefits to same-sex couples as well.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main points: the policy change, its basis in DOMA's overturn, the implications for same-sex couples, and the significance of the decision, including the marriage penalty and Edie Windsor's case.

I'll structure it by starting with the announcement, then the reason behind it, the details of the policy (state of celebration vs. residence), the benefits and the marriage penalty, and end with the significance and other agencies' actions.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all the key points without unnecessary details. Also, I need to ensure it's within the word limit, so I'll keep each sentence focused and avoid redundancy.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This policy, based on where the marriage was celebrated, ensures equal treatment under federal tax law, including benefits, credits, and responsibilities. Same-sex couples will now face the "marriage penalty," a potential higher tax burden for some. The decision, praised by Edie Windsor, whose case challenged DOMA, reflects broader federal efforts to extend benefits to same-sex couples. END OF SUMMARY.
