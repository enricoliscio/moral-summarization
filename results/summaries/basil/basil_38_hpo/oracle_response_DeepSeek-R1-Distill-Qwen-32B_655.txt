Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the U.S. Treasury recognizing same-sex marriages for federal taxes, even in states that don't. They also listed specific morally framed words that need to be included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are the Treasury's decision, the overturning of DOMA, the impact on same-sex couples, and the political significance. The morally charged words are important, so I need to make sure they're included without forcing them in.

I should start by identifying the main events: the ruling, the change in policy, the effects on couples, and the reactions, especially from Edie Windsor. I'll need to use words like "ruling," "provides," "assures," "forced," "burden," "treated," "have," "denied," "act," "extended," "recognize," and "decision."

I'll structure the summary to flow from the announcement, the reason behind it (DOMA), the implications for couples, and the broader impact. I'll make sure to mention that the policy applies regardless of residency, which is a significant change.

I should also include the positive outcomes, like access to benefits and protections, and the negative aspect of the marriage penalty. It's important to highlight that this was a remedy sought by Windsor, showing the moral correctness of the decision.

I'll keep each sentence concise, ensuring that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll check that all the morally framed words are naturally integrated without disrupting the flow.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the essence of the article and maintains the moral perspective intended by the author.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a ruling recognizing same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state of residence. This decision, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), provides clarity and equal treatment for legally married same-sex couples nationwide. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew assured couples that their federal filing status would remain consistent, even if they moved to states that do not recognize their marriage. The ruling extends federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections to same-sex couples, including access to IRA contributions, child tax credits, and estate taxes, while also subjecting them to the marriage penalty. The policy, which applies only to married couples, marks a significant step toward treating gay and lesbian couples equally under federal law. Edie Windsor, whose legal challenge to DOMA led to its overturning, hailed the decision as the remedy she sought. The Treasury's action follows broader efforts by the Obama administration to extend federal benefits to same-sex couples, reflecting progress in addressing the burden and discrimination faced by the LGBT community.  
END OF SUMMARY.
