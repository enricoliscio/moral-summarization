Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where the couple resides. This decision follows the overturning of DOMA by the Supreme Court. The key points are the recognition of same-sex marriages, the impact on tax filing, and the benefits and responsibilities now available to these couples.

I need to identify the morally framed words used: ruling, provides, assures, forced, burden, treated, have, denied, act, extended, recognize, decision. I should incorporate these into the summary as much as possible.

The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the main points: the Treasury's decision, its implications for same-sex couples, the change from DOMA, the benefits now available, and the political significance. I also need to mention Edie Windsor's case and the broader impact on federal policies.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the decision, then explaining how it changes previous policies, the benefits it provides, and the political importance. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to highlight the fairness and equality aspects.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally. I'll check each sentence to see if it includes the necessary moral framing words without making it forced. Also, I'll make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and the author's tone.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Department of the Treasury has issued a ruling that same-sex married couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes based on where they were married, regardless of their current state of residence. This decision, following the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), provides clarity and equal treatment under federal tax law for legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It assures couples that they can move freely without changes to their tax status. Previously, the IRS did not recognize same-sex marriages due to DOMA, but this new policy extends federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections to all legally married same-sex couples, regardless of residency. It also subjects them to the "marriage penalty" in certain cases. The ruling reflects progress for the LGBTQ+ community, as it addresses the burden and discrimination faced by couples like Edie Windsor, who challenged DOMA after being forced to pay estate taxes. The policy, which applies only to married couples, ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law, marking a significant step toward equality. END OF SUMMARY.
