SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This move marks a significant step forward for the LGBTQ+ community, providing certainty and clarity for same-sex married couples nationwide. The policy, prompted by the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures that all legally married same-sex couples can access federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections, regardless of their state of residency. This decision is a testament to the Obama administration's commitment to equality and justice, and is a direct result of the legal challenge to DOMA. As Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin noted, "committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation's federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home."
