SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision, prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, is a significant step forward for LGBT rights and ensures that all legally married same-sex couples are treated fairly and equally under federal tax law. The new policy means that same-sex couples will no longer face discrimination when it comes to filing taxes and will have access to the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities as heterosexual married couples. This includes all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, such as filing status, employee benefits, and tax credits. The ruling provides much-needed certainty and clarity for same-sex couples, who can now move freely throughout the country without worrying about their federal filing status changing. It also highlights the Obama administration's commitment to extending federal benefits to gay couples, even in states that do not recognize their marriages. This decision is a victory for moral justice and equality, ensuring that all Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, regardless of their sexual orientation or state of residency. 

END OF SUMMARY.
