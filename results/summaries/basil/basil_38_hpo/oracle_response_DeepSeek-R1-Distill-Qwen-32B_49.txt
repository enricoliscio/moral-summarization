Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by understanding the article.

The article talks about the U.S. Treasury's decision to recognize same-sex marriages for federal taxes, regardless of the state's recognition. It mentions the overturning of DOMA and how this affects same-sex couples. The author uses words like "ruling," "provides," "assures," "forced," etc., which are morally charged.

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. I'll need to condense the information, focusing on the key points: the decision, its impact on couples, the historical context with DOMA, and the significance of the ruling.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the positive outcome for same-sex couples, emphasizing the fairness and equality aspects. I'll also mention Edie Windsor's case to add context about the legal challenge that led to this change.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it's clear and concise, using the morally framed words effectively. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is covered without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Treasury announced a decision to recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state of residence. This ruling, following the Supreme Court’s overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), provides clarity and equal treatment for legally married same-sex couples nationwide. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew assured that couples can file taxes based on their marriage state, ensuring access to federal benefits and protections previously denied under DOMA. The policy extends to all federal tax provisions, including filing status, benefits, and credits, while also subjecting couples to the marriage penalty. Edie Windsor, whose legal challenge to DOMA led to its downfall, hailed the decision as the remedy she sought. The ruling marks a significant step toward equality, ensuring same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law, regardless of their state’s recognition of marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
