Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury's decision regarding same-sex couples and taxes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that the Treasury will recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes regardless of the state they live in. This is a significant move following the Supreme Court's overturning of DOMA. It mentions that before this, the IRS didn't recognize same-sex marriages because of DOMA, but now they will, based on where the marriage was celebrated, not where they reside.

The article also talks about the political progress for the LGBT community and the impact on couples moving to states that don't recognize their marriage. It quotes Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, emphasizing certainty and equal access to tax benefits. There's a mention of Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, who had to pay estate taxes, which would have been avoided if she were in a heterosexual marriage.

Additionally, the new policy affects various tax areas like filing status, benefits, and even introduces the marriage penalty for some couples. It also notes that this policy applies only to married couples, not domestic partnerships. The Human Rights Campaign and other agencies have supported this move, extending federal benefits to same-sex couples.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like equality and justice, as highlighted by the author. I should include the main points: the Treasury's decision, its basis in DOMA's overturning, the change from state of residence to state of celebration, the benefits and penalties, and the significance for the LGBT community.

I should structure the summary to start with the announcement, explain the change, mention the impact on couples, reference Edie Windsor's case, and conclude with the positive outcome in terms of equality. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing justice and equal treatment under federal law.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where the couple resides. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and ensures that legally married same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law. Previously, the IRS did not recognize same-sex marriages due to DOMA, but this new policy now prioritizes the state where the marriage was celebrated over the state of residency. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasized that this ruling provides clarity and equal access to tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections for same-sex couples nationwide. The policy also addresses the "marriage penalty" for some upper-middle-class couples and applies only to legally married couples, not domestic partnerships. This move marks a significant step toward equality for the LGBT community, as it ensures that couples can move freely without losing federal tax status. The decision was praised by advocates, including Edie Windsor, whose legal challenge to DOMA led to its repeal. END OF SUMMARY.
