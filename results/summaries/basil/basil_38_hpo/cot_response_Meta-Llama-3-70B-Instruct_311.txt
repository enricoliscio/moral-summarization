SUMMARY:
The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they have access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. The new policy, prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, marks a significant step forward for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. Committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residence. This ruling provides crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under DOMA. The decision is hailed as a major victory for the LGBT community, providing a uniform policy for the IRS and ensuring that same-sex couples can move freely throughout the country without worrying about their federal filing status.
