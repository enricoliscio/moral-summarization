SUMMARY: 

The US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, assuring them that they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. The decision marks a significant political progress for the LGBT community, treating committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples equally under federal tax laws. This ruling also extends federal benefits to gay couples in states that don't recognize their marriages, providing access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. The policy only applies to married couples, and not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions. This decision is a remedy to the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, which prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place.

END OF SUMMARY.
