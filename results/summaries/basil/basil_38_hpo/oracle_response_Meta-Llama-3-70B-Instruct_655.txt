SUMMARY:

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced a new policy that recognizes same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, assuring them that their federal filing status will not change if they move to a different state. The policy extends federal benefits to gay couples, including filing status, employee benefits, and tax credits, and treats them equally under federal tax laws. This decision remedies the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, which prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place. The ruling also extends the so-called marriage penalty to gay couples. LGBT advocates hail the decision as a significant step forward, providing access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under DOMA.
