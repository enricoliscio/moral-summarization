Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury deciding that same-sex couples will be recognized for federal taxes regardless of the state they live in. This is a significant move post the DOMA ruling. The key points are that the state where the marriage was celebrated matters, not the current state of residence. This affects various tax aspects like filing status, benefits, and credits. It also mentions the impact on Edie Windsor, who was a plaintiff in the DOMA case.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect. The author highlights progress for the LGBT community and the move towards equality. I should include how this decision provides fairness and equal treatment under federal law, despite state laws. Also, mention the potential for same-sex couples to face the marriage penalty, but focus on the positive aspects like access to benefits and protections.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main elements: the Treasury's decision, its implications, the reference to Edie Windsor, and the broader significance in terms of equality. I'll structure it to start with the announcement, explain the change, mention the benefits, and conclude with the moral impact, ensuring it's clear and flows well.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they reside in. This decision, influenced by the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), ensures that legally married same-sex couples can file taxes based on the state where their marriage was celebrated, rather than their current state of residence. The policy, outlined by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, provides clarity and equal access to federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections for same-sex couples nationwide. It also addresses the issue of couples moving to states that do not recognize their marriage, ensuring their federal tax status remains consistent. The ruling reflects progress for the LGBTQ+ community, as it aligns with the principle of equality and fairness under federal law. END OF SUMMARY.
