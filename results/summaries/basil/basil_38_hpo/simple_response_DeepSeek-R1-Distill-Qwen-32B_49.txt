Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I have to make sure the summary not only captures the key points but also maintains the ethical implications presented in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. Treasury has decided to recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state's laws. This change was prompted by the Supreme Court overturning DOMA. The article mentions that this affects couples who move to states that don't recognize their marriage, ensuring they can file federal taxes as married. It also highlights the political significance, referencing Edie Windsor's case, and notes that this policy extends benefits but also introduces the marriage penalty.

Now, I need to identify the moral framing. The article emphasizes equality and justice, as the policy ensures same-sex couples have the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. It also mentions the unfairness faced by couples like Edie Windsor, who had to pay estate taxes that a heterosexual couple wouldn't have. The moral angle is about fairness, legal justice, and the right to equal treatment under the law.

I should structure the summary to include these elements: the announcement by the Treasury, the reason behind it (DOMA ruling), the impact on couples in non-recognition states, the benefits extended, and the mention of the marriage penalty. I'll also need to highlight the significance of this decision in terms of equality and justice.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll start with the announcement, then explain the change, its implications, and the moral aspect by referencing the benefits and the marriage penalty. I'll conclude by noting the broader implications for equality.

I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. I'll make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed, ensuring the summary is both informative and reflects the moral stance presented in the article.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows logically and covers all necessary points while staying within the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance and adjust if needed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state in which they reside. This decision, following the Supreme Courtâ€™s overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), ensures that legally married same-sex couples can file taxes as married, even if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage. The policy, outlined by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, prioritizes the state where the marriage was celebrated over the state of residency. This change provides equal access to federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections, addressing the historical discrimination faced by same-sex couples under DOMA. Edie Windsor, whose case led to the DOMA ruling, praised the decision as a significant step toward justice. While the policy extends crucial benefits, it also subjects same-sex couples to the "marriage penalty" for certain filers. This move reflects broader progress toward equality under federal law, ensuring that committed couples are treated fairly nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
