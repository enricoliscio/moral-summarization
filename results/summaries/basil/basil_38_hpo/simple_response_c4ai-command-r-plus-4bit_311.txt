SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department announced a landmark decision to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision, prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures that all legally married same-sex couples are treated equally and fairly under federal tax law. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasized the importance of providing certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples, allowing them to access the benefits, responsibilities, and protections they deserve. This policy holds political significance as it addresses the unfair burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, which was the catalyst for the legal challenge to DOMA. The Treasury's decision ensures that all federal tax provisions, including filing status, employee benefits, and tax credits, will apply equally to same-sex couples. LGBT advocates hailed the ruling as a victory for justice and equality, ensuring that same-sex couples are no longer subjected to discriminatory tax policies. This decision is part of a series of LGBT-inclusive policies implemented by the Obama administration, demonstrating a commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of all Americans.
