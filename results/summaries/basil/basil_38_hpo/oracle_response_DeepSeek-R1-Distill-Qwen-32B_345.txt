Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the U.S. Treasury's decision to recognize same-sex marriages for federal taxes, even in states that don't recognize them. The author used words like "ruling," "provides," "assures," "forced," "burden," etc., which have moral connotations.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are:
- Treasury's decision post-DOMA overturn.
- Federal recognition based on where the marriage was celebrated, not residency.
- Impact on same-sex couples moving to non-recognizing states.
- The ruling provides certainty, benefits, and protections.
- Reference to Edie Windsor's case and the tax burden she faced.
- The new policy extends benefits and treats couples equally.
- It also mentions the "marriage penalty."
- Other agencies have also extended benefits.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words. I'll start by stating the decision, then explain the implications, mention Edie Windsor, the benefits extended, and note the other agencies' actions.

I should structure it so it flows logically: introduce the decision, explain its significance, mention the impact on individuals, and conclude with the broader context of other policies.

I'll check word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, ensure that the moral framing words are included where appropriate without forcing them.

Let me draft it step by step:
1. Start with the announcement and its basis in DOMA ruling.
2. Explain how it affects couples in non-recognizing states.
3. Mention the certainty and benefits provided.
4. Reference Edie Windsor's case and the tax burden.
5. Note the extension of benefits and equal treatment.
6. Mention the marriage penalty briefly.
7. Conclude with other agencies' actions.

Now, I'll make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral terms without making it too wordy.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has ruled that same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence, following the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This decision provides certainty and equal treatment under federal tax law, ensuring couples can access benefits and protections previously denied. The ruling assures legally married same-sex couples they can move freely without changes to their tax status. Edie Windsor, whose case highlighted the burden of DOMA, praised the decision as the remedy she sought. The policy extends federal benefits, including filing status and employee benefits, while also subjecting couples to the marriage penalty. Other agencies, such as the Federal Election Commission and Department of Health and Human Services, have similarly extended benefits to same-sex couples, reflecting broader progress for the LGBTQ+ community. END OF SUMMARY.
