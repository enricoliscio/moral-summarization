Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury recognizing same-sex marriages for tax purposes, even in states that don't recognize them. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those moral frames.

First, I'll read through the article to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "progress," "equality," "discrimination," "justice," "rights," "discriminatory," "access," "protections," "burden," "certainty," "freedom," "commitment," "love," "equality," "fairness," "discrimination," and "justice" come to mind. These words highlight the moral aspects of the issue.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, keeping those moral terms. The key points are the Treasury's decision, its impact on same-sex couples regardless of state residency, the overturning of DOMA, the benefits and responsibilities now accessible, and the mention of Edie Windsor's case. I should also note the broader implications for equality and justice.

I'll start by stating the decision, then explain how it affects couples, mention the DOMA ruling, include the benefits, and touch on the moral significance, like equality and justice. I should make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing.

**SUMMARY:**

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state of residence, marking a significant step toward equality for the LGBTQ+ community. This decision, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), ensures that legally married same-sex couples can file taxes uniformly nationwide, providing certainty and fairness. Couples will now have access to federal benefits, protections, and responsibilities, such as estate taxes and child tax credits, which were previously denied due to discriminatory laws. The ruling also means couples can move freely without fear of changing their federal filing status. While some may face the "marriage penalty," the policy underscores a commitment to justice and equality, as highlighted by advocates like Edie Windsor, whose legal challenge to DOMA paved the way for this change. This decision reflects a broader societal push for fairness and justice, ensuring that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law. END OF SUMMARY.
