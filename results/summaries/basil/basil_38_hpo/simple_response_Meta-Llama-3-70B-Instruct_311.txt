SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This move marks a significant step forward for the LGBTQ+ community, ensuring that all legally married same-sex couples can access federal tax benefits and protections. The decision was prompted by the US Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and provides a uniform policy for the IRS. Same-sex couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residence. This means they will have access to benefits such as filing status, employee benefits, and child tax credits, and will also be subject to the "marriage penalty" like heterosexual couples. The move is a significant victory for LGBTQ+ advocates, who have long fought for equal treatment under the law. As Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, hailed the decision as the "precise remedy" she sought, it is clear that this decision is a major step towards equality and justice.
