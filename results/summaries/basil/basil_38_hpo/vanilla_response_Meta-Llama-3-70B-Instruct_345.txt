SUMMARY:

The US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision follows the US Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new policy means that same-sex couples will be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residence. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and income taxes. This decision marks a significant progress for the LGBT community, providing certainty and clear tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. The policy only applies to married couples, not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions.

END OF SUMMARY.
