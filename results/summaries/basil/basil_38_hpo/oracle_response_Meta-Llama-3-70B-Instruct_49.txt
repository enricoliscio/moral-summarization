SUMMARY:

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced a ruling that recognizes same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, assures them of federal tax benefits and protections, and treats them equally under federal tax laws. The ruling is a significant step forward for the LGBT community, who were previously forced to pay higher taxes and were denied access to benefits due to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Treasury's decision extends federal benefits to gay couples in states that don't recognize their marriages, and provides access to benefits such as filing status, employee benefits, and child tax credits. This act of recognition is a remedy to the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, and marks a significant milestone in the fight for equality. END OF SUMMARY.
