Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Department of the Treasury recognizing same-sex marriages for tax purposes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, which probably means highlighting the positive changes and the significance for the LGBTQ+ community. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are: the Treasury's decision, the overturning of DOMA, the impact on same-sex couples in states that don't recognize their marriage, the new policy's details, and the political significance, including Edie Windsor's case.

I should start by stating the main decision: the Treasury recognizing same-sex marriages for federal taxes regardless of state laws. Then mention that this follows the DOMA ruling. It's important to note that this provides uniformity, so couples moving to non-recognizing states won't lose federal benefits. 

I should include the quote from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to emphasize the positive impact. Also, mention the political significance, referencing Edie Windsor's case to show the historical context and the progress made. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll also ensure to highlight the benefits like tax protections and the end of discrimination, aligning with the moral framing of equality and justice. 

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Make sure to cover all the important aspects without getting too detailed. The summary should flow logically, starting with the announcement, its implications, and the significance of the ruling.

Let me structure it: start with the announcement, explain the change from DOMA, mention the new policy's details, include quotes, and end with the broader impact and significance. That should cover all the necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where the couple resides. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and provides clarity for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriage. The policy, outlined by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, ensures that federal tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections apply based on the state where the marriage was celebrated, rather than the state of residency. This move addresses the discrimination faced by same-sex couples under DOMA, as highlighted by Edie Windsor's case, where she was forced to pay estate taxes after her wife's death. The new policy extends federal tax provisions to same-sex couples nationwide, including benefits like child tax credits and IRA contributions, while also subjecting them to the "marriage penalty." Advocates, including the Human Rights Campaign, praised the decision as a step toward equality, ensuring that legally married same-sex couples are treated fairly under federal tax law. END OF SUMMARY.
