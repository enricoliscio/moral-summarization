SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of whether their state of residence recognizes their union. This decision was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) earlier this year. Prior to the ruling, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not recognize same-sex marriages in states that did not perform them. Now, the state where the marriage was celebrated will take precedence over the state of residency for federal tax status. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the new policy provides certainty and equal access to benefits for all legally married same-sex couples. The policy will apply to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, and will also subject gay couples to the "marriage penalty" where some joint filers pay a higher tax rate. LGBT advocates and the plaintiff in the DOMA case, Edie Windsor, praised the decision as a crucial step towards equality and a remedy to the unfair tax burden that same-sex couples previously faced.
