Okay, I need to summarize this article about the U.S. Treasury's decision regarding same-sex couples' taxes. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that the Treasury announced they'll recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes, even if the couple lives in a state that doesn't recognize it. This was prompted by the Supreme Court overturning DOMA. 

Previously, the IRS didn't recognize same-sex marriages because of DOMA, but now they're changing that. The key point is that the state where the wedding took place (state of celebration) determines their federal tax status, not their current state of residence. 

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's statement emphasizes providing certainty and equal access to tax benefits, responsibilities, and protections. This means couples can move freely without worrying about their tax status changing. 

The article also mentions the political significance, referencing Edie Windsor's case which challenged DOMA. She had to pay estate taxes which a heterosexual couple wouldn't have. Now, the IRS owes her money, and under the new policy, same-sex couples get the same tax treatment as heterosexual couples, including potential marriage penalties.

Additionally, the policy only applies to legally married couples, not domestic partnerships. The Human Rights Campaign praised this as a step towards equality. Other agencies under the Obama administration have also extended federal benefits to same-sex couples.

So, the main points are: 
- Treasury recognizes same-sex marriages for federal taxes regardless of state.
- The state where the marriage occurred determines tax status.
- Provides equality in tax benefits and responsibilities.
- Reference to Edie Windsor's case and the reversal of DOMA's effects.
- Other federal agencies have followed suit.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that same-sex couples' marriages will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they reside in. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Previously, the IRS did not recognize same-sex marriages due to DOMA, but now, the state where the marriage was celebrated determines federal tax status, not the state of residence. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that this ruling ensures equal access to tax benefits and protections for same-sex couples nationwide. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions involving marriage, including filing status, benefits, and taxes, and subjects couples to the marriage penalty. Edie Windsor, whose case led to DOMA's repeal, praised the decision. Other federal agencies have also extended benefits to same-sex couples. END OF SUMMARY.
