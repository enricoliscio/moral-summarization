Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury's decision regarding same-sex couples' taxes. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that the Treasury announced they'll recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes, even if the couple lives in a state that doesn't. This is because the Supreme Court overturned DOMA. Before, the IRS didn't recognize same-sex marriages due to DOMA's section 3. Now, the state where the wedding took place matters more than where they live.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said this provides clarity and equal benefits for same-sex couples nationwide. It also means they can move without worrying about their tax status changing. The new policy affects all federal tax areas related to marriage, like filing status, benefits, and taxes. However, same-sex couples might also face the marriage penalty, which some couples pay more taxes when filing jointly.

The policy only applies to legally married couples, not domestic partnerships. Edie Windsor, who was the plaintiff in the DOMA case, praised the decision. Other agencies under Obama have also extended benefits to same-sex couples.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: the Treasury's decision, the reason (DOMA overturn), the effect on same-sex couples regardless of state, the benefits they now have, the marriage penalty, and the significance of the ruling.

I should structure it to first state the announcement, then explain the change from DOMA, mention the policy's specifics, and conclude with the impact and significance, including Edie Windsor's comment.

Let me make sure I include all key elements without going over the word limit. I'll need to be concise and avoid unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Previously, the IRS did not recognize same-sex marriages due to DOMA. The new policy, announced by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, ensures that legally married same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law, with the state where the marriage was celebrated determining their tax status. This includes benefits, responsibilities, and protections such as filing status, employee benefits, and estate taxes. The policy also subjects same-sex couples to the "marriage penalty," where joint filers may face higher taxes. The decision, which applies only to legally married couples, was praised by Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, as it ensures equality for same-sex couples nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
