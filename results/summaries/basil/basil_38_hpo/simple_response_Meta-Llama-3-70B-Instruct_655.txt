SUMMARY:

In a major victory for the LGBTQ+ community, the US Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision marks a significant step forward in ensuring equal treatment under federal tax laws. The ruling, prompted by the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, means that same-sex couples will now have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. The policy applies to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, and estate taxes. This move brings an end to the discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples under federal tax laws, ensuring that they are treated equally and with dignity. As Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin noted, "committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation's federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home."
