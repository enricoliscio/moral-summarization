SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department ruled on Thursday that same-sex married couples will be recognized for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance on tax filing for all legally married same-sex couples, assuring them of equal treatment under federal tax law. It was prompted by the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) earlier this year, which had previously forced same-sex couples to bear an unfair tax burden. The Treasury Secretary, Jacob Lew, stated that the new policy will allow couples to move freely throughout the country, knowing that their federal filing status is secure. LGBT advocates hailed the ruling as a victory for equal rights, providing access to benefits and protections that were previously denied to same-sex couples. The policy extends to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor and holds political significance as the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples was the catalyst for the legal challenge to DOMA. This ruling is the latest in a series of LGBT-friendly policies offered by the Obama administration, with other agencies also extending federal benefits to gay couples in states that do not recognize their marriages.
END OF SUMMARY.
