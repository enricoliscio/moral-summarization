SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department has ruled that same-sex married couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples, assuring them that they will be treated equally under federal tax laws and have access to benefits and protections previously denied to them under the Defense of Marriage Act. The decision was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn DOMA and provides a uniform policy for the IRS, with the state of celebration taking precedence over the state of residency. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples, and assures them that they can move freely throughout the country without worrying about a change in their federal filing status. The policy will apply to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor and will extend benefits to same-sex couples who were previously burdened by unequal tax laws. This ruling is a significant step forward in recognizing the rights and equality of the LGBT community.
END OF SUMMARY.
