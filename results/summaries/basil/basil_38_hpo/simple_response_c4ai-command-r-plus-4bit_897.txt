SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of whether their state of residence recognizes their union. This decision is a victory for moral justice and equality for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, and ensures that all legally married couples are treated fairly and equally under federal tax law. The policy means that same-sex couples will no longer be subjected to the unfair burden of higher taxes that they previously faced, and will now have access to the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities as heterosexual married couples. The ruling by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is a significant step forward politically, as it provides a uniform policy that recognizes the rights of same-sex couples nationwide, allowing them to move freely without worrying about changes in their federal filing status. It is a welcome development that upholds the values of equality and justice, and ensures that all citizens are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
