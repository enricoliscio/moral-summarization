SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new policy provides a uniform guideline for the IRS, stating that the state where the wedding took place will determine federal tax status, rather than the state of residency. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that this ruling provides certainty and access to benefits for all legally married same-sex couples. The policy holds political significance as the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples was the catalyst for the legal challenge to DOMA. The Treasury's actions are the latest in a series of LGBT policy changes by the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling. Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, hailed the decision as a remedy for the discrimination she faced.
