SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of whether their state of residence recognizes their union. This decision is a direct result of the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. Prior to this, the IRS did not recognize same-sex marriages in states that did not allow it. Now, the state where the marriage was celebrated takes precedence over the state of residency for federal tax status. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that this ruling provides certainty and equal access to benefits for all legally married same-sex couples across the nation. The new policy holds political significance as it was the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples that sparked the legal challenge against DOMA. This policy ensures that same-sex couples will be treated equally under federal tax laws and will have access to crucial tax benefits and protections. The Treasury's decision is the latest in a series of LGBT-friendly policies implemented by the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling.
