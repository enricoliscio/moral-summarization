SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department ruled on Thursday that same-sex married couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples, assuring them that they will be treated equally under federal tax law and have access to benefits previously denied to them by the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. The decision was prompted by the Supreme Court's overturning of DOMA and marks a significant political progress for the LGBT community. The new policy means that all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor will apply equally to same-sex couples, including filing status, employee benefits, and tax credits. It also means that gay couples will now be subject to the "marriage penalty," where joint filers may face a higher tax burden. The Treasury's ruling provides much-needed certainty and protection for same-sex couples, who can now move freely throughout the country knowing their federal filing status is secure. This decision is a powerful act of recognition and assurance for LGBT Americans, and a testament to the ongoing progress in extending equal rights to all citizens.
