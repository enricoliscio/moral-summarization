SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced a ruling that recognizes same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, even if they live in a state that does not. This decision provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, assuring them that they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. The ruling treats same-sex couples equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residency, and provides access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections that all Americans deserve. This decision remedies the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, which prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place. The policy extends federal benefits to gay couples in states that don't recognize their marriages, and assures that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples are treated equally and have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. END OF SUMMARY.
