SUMMARY:

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages for tax purposes, even if they live in a state that does not. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, assuring them that they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. The decision marks a significant political progress for the LGBT community, providing access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. Same-sex couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of where they live, and will have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling also holds that gay couples will be subjected to the marriage penalty, just like heterosexual couples. This decision is a remedy to the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, which prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place.

END OF SUMMARY.
