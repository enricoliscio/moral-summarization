SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury has ruled that it will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples for tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples, assuring them that they will be treated equally under federal tax law and have access to benefits and protections previously denied to them under the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling was prompted by the Supreme Court's overturning of DOMA in June, which had forced same-sex couples to bear the burden of unequal tax treatment. The Treasury's policy will apply to all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, benefits, and credits. LGBT advocates have hailed the decision as a crucial step towards equality, providing same-sex couples with the recognition and protection they deserve under the law. This ruling extends the recent progress made by the Obama administration in offering LGBT policies and benefits to gay couples, even in states that do not recognize their marriages.
END OF SUMMARY.
