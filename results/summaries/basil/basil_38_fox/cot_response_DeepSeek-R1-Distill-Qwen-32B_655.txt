Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants two things: first, to identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, to write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about the IRS and Treasury allowing same-sex couples to file joint federal taxes. The moral framing here is important because it's about equality, rights, discrimination, etc. I need to pick out words that carry moral weight.

First, I'll go through the article sentence by sentence. The first paragraph mentions "legally married same-sex couples" and "tax benefits." Not sure if those are morally framed yet. Next, "Defense of Marriage Act" was overturned, which is a law that was discriminatory. So "discriminatory" is a moral word. 

The announcement by the IRS and Treasury is about equality, so "equality" is another moral term. The quotes from Chad Griffin talk about "discriminatory" and "access to benefits." Then Brian Brown refers to it as "lawlessness" and "forcing same-sex marriage," which are negative moral terms.

So, the morally framed words I identified are: legally, equality, rights, access, benefits, responsibilities, protections, discrimination, lawlessness, force, marriage, public, responsibility.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. The summary should mention the IRS and Treasury's decision, the overturning of DOMA, the benefits for same-sex couples, the positive reactions emphasizing equality and access, and the opposing view about lawlessness and forcing marriage.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the announcement, mention DOMA, the benefits, reactions from both sides, and conclude with the significance of the ruling.

I should double-check that I included all the key points and the moral framing words. Let me make sure each sentence in the summary includes at least one of those words without making it forced. Also, ensure that the summary accurately reflects both the positive and negative viewpoints presented in the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, ensuring equality and access to the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of a part of the Defense of Marriage Act, addressing concerns about how the federal government would treat same-sex couples in states that do not recognize gay marriage. The ruling grants all legally married same-sex couples nationwide the benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve, regardless of their state of residence. Supporters, including the Human Rights Campaign, praised the decision as a step toward equality, while opponents, like the National Organization of Marriage, criticized it as continuing a pattern of lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage on the public.
