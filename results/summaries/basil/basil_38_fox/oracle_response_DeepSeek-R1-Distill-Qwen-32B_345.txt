Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint tax returns. 

First, I'll identify the key points: the announcement by IRS and Treasury, the overturning of part of DOMA, the benefits for same-sex couples, the reactions from different groups, and the moral words used.

I should include words like "file," "receive," "overturned," "affect," "access," "deserve," "equally," "denied," "lawlessness," and "forcing." 

I'll start by stating the main action: allowing same-sex couples to file joint tax returns. Mention the overturning of DOMA. Then, explain that the ruling affects all legally married couples regardless of state, but not domestic partnerships. Include the positive statements from Lew and Griffin about equality and benefits. Then, note the opposing view from Brown about lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while incorporating the moral terms.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The ruling affects all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state of residence, though it does not apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasized that this provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance," ensuring access to benefits and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign praised the ruling, stating that it treats gay and lesbian married couples equally under federal tax laws, ending the discriminatory denial of benefits under DOMA. However, Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage criticized the decision, calling it a pattern of lawlessness and accusing the administration of forcing same-sex marriage on the public.
