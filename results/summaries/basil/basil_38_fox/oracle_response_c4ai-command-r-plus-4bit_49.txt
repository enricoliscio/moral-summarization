SUMMARY: Legally married same-sex couples will now be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, according to a ruling by the IRS and Treasury Department. This ruling grants homosexual couples access to the same tax benefits that heterosexual couples receive when filing jointly. The decision follows a historic move by the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned a section of the Defense of Marriage Act, raising questions about the federal government's treatment of same-sex couples in states that do not recognize gay marriage. The new rules affect all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but do not extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew affirmed that the ruling provides certainty, clear guidance, and access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections that all Americans deserve under federal tax law. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin celebrated the ruling, stating that gay and lesbian married couples will finally be treated equally, no longer denied crucial tax benefits, and protected from discrimination. Critics, such as Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage, argued that the decision forces same-sex'marriage' and represents lawlessness, asserting that Congress should determine federal tax law.
END OF SUMMARY.
