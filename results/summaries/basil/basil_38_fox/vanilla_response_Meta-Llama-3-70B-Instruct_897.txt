SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new policy applies to all legally married gay couples, regardless of where they live, but does not extend to domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the ruling provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" for same-sex couples. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the decision, saying it treats gay and lesbian couples equally under federal tax laws. However, not everyone is in favor of the decision, with National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown calling it a "pattern of lawlessness" and arguing that Congress should determine federal tax law.
