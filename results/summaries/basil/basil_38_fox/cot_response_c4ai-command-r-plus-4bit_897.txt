SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This announcement comes as a follow-up to the historic decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules will apply regardless of the couple's state of residence, ensuring moral certainty, coherence, and equality under federal tax law. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling, stating that it grants committed gay and lesbian spouses access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, criticized the decision, arguing that it continues a pattern of lawlessness and that the Obama administration is forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public. He asserted that determining federal tax law is the responsibility of Congress alone. END OF SUMMARY.
