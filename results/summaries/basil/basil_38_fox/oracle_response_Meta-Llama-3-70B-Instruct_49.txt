SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, allowing them to receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules provide certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, giving them access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that they deserve. This means that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residence. They will finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections that were previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, not everyone agrees, with some arguing that this decision continues a pattern of lawlessness and that the Obama administration is forcing same-sex "marriage" on an unwilling public.
