SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of where they live. According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, this decision gives "access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve." Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin hailed the decision, saying it treats "committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples equally under our nation's federal tax laws," finally giving them access to "crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act." However, opponents like Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage argue that this decision continues a "pattern of lawlessness" and amounts to "forcing same-sex'marriage' on an unwilling public."
END OF SUMMARY.
