SUMMARY:

In a historic move, the IRS and Treasury Department announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, allowing them to receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a part of the Defense of Marriage Act, and ensures that all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, will have access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, this ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples nationwide, treating them equally under federal tax laws. However, not everyone agrees, with Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, claiming that this decision continues a pattern of lawlessness and forces same-sex "marriage" on an unwilling public.
