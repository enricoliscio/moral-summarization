SUMMARY: In a landmark ruling, the IRS and Treasury Department declared that legally married same-sex couples are now entitled to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal status with heterosexual married couples. This decision upholds the moral principle of equality and justice by ensuring that all legally married couples, regardless of sexual orientation, are treated fairly and have access to the same benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law. The ruling is a significant step forward in recognizing the rights of same-sex couples, following the Supreme Court's earlier strike-down of a section of the Defense of Marriage Act. It sends a clear message that discrimination based on sexual orientation is unacceptable and that all citizens deserve equal treatment under the law. The decision has been applauded by human rights advocates as a victory for moral progress, while some opponents argue that it oversteps the executive branch's authority. This ruling reinforces the ethical value of equality and represents a significant shift towards a more inclusive and just society that recognizes the dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status. 

END OF SUMMARY.
