SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules apply to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but do not extend to domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the ruling provides certainty and equal access to benefits and protections under federal tax law. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin hailed the decision as a victory for equality, while opponents, such as National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown, criticized the move as "lawlessness" and an overreach of executive power.
