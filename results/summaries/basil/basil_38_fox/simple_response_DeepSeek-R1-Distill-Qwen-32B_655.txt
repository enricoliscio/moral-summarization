Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing that the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. This change comes after the Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The decision means that same-sex couples can now receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples, regardless of where they live, as long as their marriage is legally recognized. However, domestic partnerships and civil unions aren't covered by this ruling.

The author includes statements from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Chad Griffin from the Human Rights Campaign, who both support the decision, emphasizing equality and the end of discrimination. On the other hand, Brian Brown from the National Organization for Marriage opposes it, calling it lawlessness and arguing that only Congress should decide federal tax laws.

So, the moral framing here is about equality and justice versus opposition based on traditional views or concerns about federal overreach. I need to make sure the summary reflects this by including both the supportive and opposing viewpoints.

I should structure the summary to first state the main decision, then mention the Supreme Court's role, the implications for same-sex couples, the reactions from supporters, and then the opposing viewpoint. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements without losing the moral aspects.

Let me draft this step by step. Start with the announcement, then the context from DOMA, the effect on couples, the supporters' statements, and the opposition. Make sure each part is clear and concise, preserving the moral arguments on both sides.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to summarizing the given text accurately while highlighting the moral framing. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.
