SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the IRS and Treasury Department ruled that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, allowing them to receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling overturned previous discrimination and affected all legally married gay couples nationwide, regardless of their state's stance on gay marriage. The decision provides certainty, equality, and access to crucial tax benefits and protections that all Americans deserve, according to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. However, not everyone agrees with this decision, with some claiming that it is a display of "lawlessness" and an overreach of power by the Obama administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
