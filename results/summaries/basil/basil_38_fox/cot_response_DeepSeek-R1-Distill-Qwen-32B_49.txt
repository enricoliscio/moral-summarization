Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file federal joint tax returns. They mention that this gives same-sex couples the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. The decision follows the Supreme Court overturning part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). There's also mention that this applies nationwide, regardless of state laws, but doesn't cover domestic partnerships or civil unions.

Now, looking for morally framed words. The key terms here are "equality," "discrimination," "justice," "rights," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "lawlessness," and "unwilling public." These words carry moral weight and indicate the author's stance on the issue.

The summary should include these terms to reflect the moral framing. I need to ensure that the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main points: the ruling, its implications, the Supreme Court's decision, the nationwide application, the exclusion of domestic partnerships, and the reactions from both supporters and opponents.

I should structure the summary to first state the ruling, then explain its significance in terms of equality and justice, mention the Supreme Court's role, the nationwide application, and then touch on the opposing views about lawlessness and public opinion. This way, the moral framing is preserved through the use of the identified terms.

**SUMMARY:**

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, ensuring equality and justice by granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of a part of the Defense of Marriage Act, addressing concerns about how the federal government would treat same-sex couples in states that don't recognize gay marriage. The ruling applies nationwide, regardless of state laws, though it excludes domestic partnerships and civil unions. Supporters, including the Human Rights Campaign, celebrate this as a step toward equality, ending discrimination and providing crucial benefits to same-sex couples. However, opponents, like the National Organization of Marriage, criticize the decision as "lawlessness," arguing it forces same-sex marriage on an "unwilling public." The ruling underscores the administration's intent to expand rights under federal tax law, despite opposition.
