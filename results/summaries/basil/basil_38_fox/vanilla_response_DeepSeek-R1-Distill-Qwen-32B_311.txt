Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about same-sex couples filing joint tax returns. They provided the article, so I need to read through it carefully. The key points are the IRS and Treasury Department's announcement allowing legally married same-sex couples to file jointly, which gives them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This follows the Supreme Court overturning part of DOMA. 

I should note that the ruling applies nationwide, regardless of where the couples live, but doesn't affect domestic partnerships or civil unions. There are quotes from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Chad Griffin, both supporting the decision, and Brian Brown opposing it, arguing it's lawlessness.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start with the main announcement, mention the Supreme Court's role, clarify the scope of the ruling, and include the reactions from both supporters and opponents. Making sure to highlight the benefits and the opposition's stance. I'll end with the summary token as instructed.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new rules apply to all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state of residence, but do not extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling, stating it ensures equality and access to tax benefits for same-sex couples. However, opponents like Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage criticized the decision, calling it "lawlessness" and arguing that only Congress should determine federal tax law. END OF SUMMARY.
