Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified certain morally charged words that should be included. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the IRS and Treasury allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. This change follows the Supreme Court overturning part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The benefits apply nationwide, regardless of state laws, but don't extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. There are quotes from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Chad Griffin, who see this as equal treatment and access to benefits. Brian Brown from the National Organization of Marriage opposes it, calling it lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage on the public.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using the specified moral words: file, receive, overturned, affect, access, deserve, equally, denied, lawlessness, forcing. I should structure the summary to highlight the key points and include these words where appropriate.

I'll start by stating the announcement, then mention the Supreme Court's decision, the effect on couples nationwide, the benefits they receive, and the opposing views. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all the necessary points and moral language. I'll check each sentence to see if it incorporates the required words and maintains the moral perspective presented in the original article.

SUMMARY:  
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling affects all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they receive equal access to tax benefits and protections under federal law. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasized that this change provides certainty and equal treatment for all Americans. Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign praised the ruling, stating that it treats committed gay and lesbian couples equally, ending the discrimination they were previously denied under the Defense of Marriage Act. However, Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage criticized the decision, calling it "lawlessness" and accusing the administration of forcing same-sex marriage on the public. The new rules do not apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. END OF SUMMARY.
