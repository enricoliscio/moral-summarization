SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new policy applies to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but does not extend to domestic partnerships and civil unions. This decision is a significant step towards equality, providing same-sex couples with access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. As Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated, "Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide." However, not everyone agrees, with opponents like Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage claiming that the decision is an example of "lawlessness" and an overreach of executive power.
