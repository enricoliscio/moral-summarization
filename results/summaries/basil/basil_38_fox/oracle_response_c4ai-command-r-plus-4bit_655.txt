SUMMARY: Legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns and receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples, the IRS and Treasury Department announced. This ruling overturns previous policies and allows all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, access to the tax benefits and protections that they deserve and were previously denied. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin celebrated the decision, stating that gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws. The new rules, however, do not apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Some, such as Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage, criticized the decision as an example of "lawlessness," arguing that the Obama administration is forcing same-sex marriage on the public and overstepping its authority in determining federal tax law.
END OF SUMMARY.
