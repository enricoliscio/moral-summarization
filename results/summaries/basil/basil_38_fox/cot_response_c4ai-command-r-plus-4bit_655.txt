SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced a ruling that grants same-sex married couples the right to file federal joint tax returns, providing them with the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This announcement comes as a follow-up to the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision earlier this year to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules will allow all legally married same-sex couples, regardless of their state of residence, to enjoy the benefits, responsibilities, and protections afforded to heterosexual couples under federal tax law. This decision has been applauded by the Human Rights Campaign, who view it as a victory for committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples, finally granting them access to crucial tax benefits and protections that were previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, not everyone agrees with this decision, with some, like the National Organization of Marriage, claiming that it continues a pattern of lawlessness and infringes on the responsibilities of Congress to determine federal tax law. The Obama administration's decision ensures that all legally married same-sex couples are treated equally and receive the benefits and protections they deserve under federal tax law. END OF SUMMARY.
