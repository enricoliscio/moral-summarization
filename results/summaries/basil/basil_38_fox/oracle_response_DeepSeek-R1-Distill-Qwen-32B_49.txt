Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. This decision follows the Supreme Court overturning part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The ruling affects all legally married same-sex couples regardless of their state's recognition of gay marriage. However, it doesn't apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. The Treasury Secretary and the Human Rights Campaign president support this decision, stating that it provides equality and access to benefits that were previously denied. On the other hand, the National Organization of Marriage criticizes it as lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage on the public.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author: file, receive, overturned, affect, access, deserve, equally, denied, lawlessness, forcing. My goal is to include these words in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main points: the announcement by IRS and Treasury, the impact of the Supreme Court's decision, the application to all legally married couples regardless of state, the exclusion of domestic partnerships, the positive statements from supporters, and the negative reaction from critics.

I'll start by mentioning the announcement and the action taken. Then, explain how it overturns DOMA and affects same-sex couples. Next, include the access to benefits and the deserving nature. Highlight the equality aspect and the denied benefits. Finally, mention the criticism about lawlessness and forcing the issue.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll also check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The ruling affects all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state's recognition of gay marriage, but does not apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the move, stating it provides access to benefits and protections that all Americans deserve, ending discrimination. However, critics like Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage argue the decision promotes lawlessness and forces same-sex marriage on the public, claiming only Congress should determine federal tax law. END OF SUMMARY.
