SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, allowing them to receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn a part of the Defense of Marriage Act, and provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, this ruling provides access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin notes that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, and finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. However, not everyone agrees, with National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown claiming that this decision continues a pattern of lawlessness and forces same-sex "marriage" on an unwilling public.
