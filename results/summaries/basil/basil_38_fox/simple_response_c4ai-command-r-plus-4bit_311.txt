SUMMARY: In a historic move towards equality, the IRS and Treasury Department have ruled that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision comes after the Supreme Court's momentous ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules ensure that all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, are treated equally under federal tax law. This is a significant step forward for gay rights, as it provides same-sex couples with access to crucial tax benefits and protections that were once unfairly denied to them. The ruling affirms the moral principle that all loving and committed couples deserve equal treatment and respect under the law, regardless of sexual orientation. However, not everyone supports this progress, with some claiming that it goes against the law.
