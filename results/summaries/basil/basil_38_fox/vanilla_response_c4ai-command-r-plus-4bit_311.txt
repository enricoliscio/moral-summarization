SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department announced that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules will apply to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but not to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and human rights advocates praised the ruling as a step towards equality, while opponents, such as the National Organization of Marriage, criticized it as overstepping federal authority. This ruling is seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate over same-sex marriage rights in the United States.
