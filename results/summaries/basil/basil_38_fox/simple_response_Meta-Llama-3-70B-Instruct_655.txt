SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act, and ensures that all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, will be treated equally under federal tax law. This decision provides crucial benefits and protections to committed and loving gay and lesbian couples, who were previously denied these rights under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. While some, like Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, hail this decision as a victory for equality and justice, others, like National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown, decry it as "lawlessness" and an overreach of executive power.
