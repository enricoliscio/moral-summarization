SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new policy applies to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but excludes domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew hailed the decision as providing "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" and ensuring that all Americans have access to federal tax law benefits. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling, saying it finally treats gay and lesbian married couples equally under federal tax laws. However, opponents like National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown condemned the decision, calling it "lawlessness" and an overreach of executive power.
