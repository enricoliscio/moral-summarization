Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the IRS allowing same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The main points are: the IRS and Treasury Department have allowed legally married same-sex couples to file joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This follows the Supreme Court overturning part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The announcement clarifies treatment for couples in states that don't recognize gay marriage, affecting all legally married same-sex couples regardless of residence. It doesn't apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. There are quotes from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign, who see this as a step towards equality. On the other hand, Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage opposes it, calling it lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage on the public.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements while highlighting the moral arguments from both sides. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. I'll structure it by stating the decision, its context, the implications, and the reactions from supporters and opponents. That should cover the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The ruling applies to all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state's recognition of gay marriage, though it does not extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Supporters, including Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, view this as a step toward equality and fairness under federal tax law. However, critics like Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage argue that the decision promotes "lawlessness" and forces same-sex marriage on an unwilling public. The announcement addresses uncertainty following the Supreme Court's ruling and provides clarity for same-sex couples seeking federal tax benefits. END OF SUMMARY.
