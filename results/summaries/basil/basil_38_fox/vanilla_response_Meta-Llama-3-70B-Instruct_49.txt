SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's historic ruling earlier this year, which overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules apply to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but do not apply to domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the ruling provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" for same-sex couples. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the decision, saying it treats gay and lesbian married couples equally under federal tax laws. However, not everyone agrees, with National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown calling the decision "lawlessness" and stating that Congress alone has the responsibility of determining federal tax law.
