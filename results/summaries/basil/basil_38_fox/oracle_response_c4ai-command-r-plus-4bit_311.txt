SUMMARY: Legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns and receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples, the IRS and Treasury Department announced. This ruling overturns previous policies that denied these benefits to homosexual couples and provides access to crucial tax advantages and protections. According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, this decision offers certainty and fair tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples across the nation, ensuring they are treated equally and receive the benefits, responsibilities, and protections they deserve under federal tax law. This ruling follows a historic Supreme Court decision earlier this year, which struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules will affect all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence. However, the decision has been met with opposition, with critics arguing that it represents lawlessness and an overreach of executive power.
END OF SUMMARY.
