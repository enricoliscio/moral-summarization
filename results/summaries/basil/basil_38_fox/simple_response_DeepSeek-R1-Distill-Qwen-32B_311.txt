Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first. It's about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. They mention the Supreme Court overturning part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which is a big deal. The article also notes that this applies everywhere, regardless of state laws, but doesn't cover domestic partnerships or civil unions. 

There are quotes from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, both positive about the ruling, emphasizing equality and benefits. On the other hand, Brian Brown from the National Organization for Marriage is critical, calling it lawlessness and saying the administration is forcing same-sex marriage on the public. 

So, the summary needs to capture both the positive and negative viewpoints. I should highlight the main points: the ruling, its implications, the reactions from supporters and opponents, and the moral aspects each side presents. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens. Let me make sure to include the key elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first state the announcement, then the context from the Supreme Court, followed by the reactions from both supporters and critics, emphasizing the moral arguments each side makes. That should cover the summary effectively while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act, addressing uncertainty for couples in states that don't recognize gay marriage. The ruling applies nationwide but excludes domestic partnerships and civil unions. Supporters, including Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, applaud the move for promoting equality and access to federal tax protections. However, critics like Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage argue it perpetuates "lawlessness" and forces same-sex marriage on the public, claiming only Congress should determine tax laws. END OF SUMMARY.
