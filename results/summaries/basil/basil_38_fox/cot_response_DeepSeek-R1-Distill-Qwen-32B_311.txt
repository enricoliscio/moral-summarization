Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a news article about the IRS allowing same-sex couples to file joint tax returns. They want me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a concise summary.

First, I'll read through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "allowed," "receive," "benefits," "equally," "discriminatory," "lawlessness," "forcing," "unwilling," "intent," "deny," "discriminatory," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny,"
