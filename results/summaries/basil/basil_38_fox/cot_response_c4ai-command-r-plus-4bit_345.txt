SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This historic ruling comes after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year and addresses questions regarding same-sex couples in states that do not recognize gay marriage. The new policies will provide certainty, clear and coherent guidance, and access to crucial benefits and protections that all Americans deserve, according to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin celebrates this ruling as a victory for committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples, who will now be treated equally under federal tax laws regardless of their state of residence. However, not everyone agrees with this decision, with some claiming that it continues a pattern of lawlessness and that the Obama administration is forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public, overriding the responsibility of Congress to determine federal tax law.
