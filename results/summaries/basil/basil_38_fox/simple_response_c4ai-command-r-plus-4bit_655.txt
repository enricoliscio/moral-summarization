SUMMARY: In a historic move towards equality, the IRS and Treasury Department ruled that legally married same-sex couples are now entitled to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision ensures that all legally married same-sex couples across the nation, regardless of their state of residence, can enjoy the same rights, benefits, and protections under federal tax law. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling for its promotion of fairness and the extension of crucial tax benefits to committed gay and lesbian couples, previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, the decision faced criticism from the National Organization of Marriage, which argued that the Obama administration was overstepping its boundaries and imposing same-sex marriage on the public. Despite this opposition, the ruling represents a significant step forward in recognizing the rights and equality of same-sex couples in the United States.
