Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They've specified certain morally charged words that must be included. I need to make sure the summary uses as many of those words as possible without making it sound forced.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The IRS and Treasury have allowed same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns, following the Supreme Court's overturning of part of DOMA. This affects all legally married same-sex couples regardless of their state, but doesn't apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. There are positive reactions from groups supporting equality and negative reactions from those opposing it.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words: file, receive, overturned, affect, access, deserve, equally, denied, lawlessness, forcing. I should incorporate these into the summary.

I'll start by stating the announcement, using "file" and "receive." Then mention the Supreme Court's action with "overturned." Highlight that the ruling affects all legally married couples, using "affect." Emphasize the access to benefits and that they deserve it, using "access" and "deserve." Include the equal treatment with "equally." Note the opposition's view about being denied rights and the term "lawlessness." Finally, mention the criticism about forcing same-sex marriage.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear. I'll structure it to first present the positive changes and then the opposing views, using the specified words naturally throughout.

SUMMARY:  
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new rules affect all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state of residence, but do not apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasized that the ruling provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance," ensuring access to benefits and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. Advocates, including the Human Rights Campaign, celebrated the move, stating that same-sex couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, ending the discriminatory denial of benefits under DOMA. However, opponents, like the National Organization for Marriage, criticized the decision, calling it "lawlessness" and accusing the administration of forcing same-sex marriage on the public. END OF SUMMARY.
