SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have ruled that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal access to the tax benefits that heterosexual couples receive when filing jointly. This ruling overturns the previous discrimination and provides all legally married gay couples with the tax benefits and protections they deserve, regardless of their state of residence. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin celebrated the decision, stating that gay and lesbian married couples will finally be treated equally under federal tax laws. He emphasized the access to crucial tax benefits and protections that were previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, not everyone agreed with the decision, with some claiming that it continues a pattern of lawlessness and that the Obama administration is forcing same-sex marriage on the public. 
END OF SUMMARY.
