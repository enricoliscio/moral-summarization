SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of where they live. According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, this decision provides access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin hailed the decision, stating that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, finally gaining access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, not everyone agrees, with National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown condemning the decision as "continues a pattern of lawlessness" and accusing the Obama administration of forcing same-sex'marriage' on an unwilling public.
