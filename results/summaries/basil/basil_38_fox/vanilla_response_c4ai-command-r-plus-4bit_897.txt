SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal tax benefits to heterosexual married couples. This decision follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules will apply to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but not to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin have praised the ruling as a step towards equality, ensuring that all legally married couples have access to the same tax benefits and protections. However, the decision has been criticized by the National Organization of Marriage, which believes that the Obama administration is overstepping its bounds and that Congress should determine federal tax law. This ruling is seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate over same-sex marriage rights in the United States.
