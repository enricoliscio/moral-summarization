SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new policy provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state of residence. This means that "committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation's federal tax laws." However, not everyone agrees, with some arguing that this decision "continues a pattern of lawlessness" and that the Obama administration is "forcing same-sex'marriage' on an unwilling public." Despite this opposition, the ruling marks a significant step towards equality, finally providing same-sex couples with access to "crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act."
