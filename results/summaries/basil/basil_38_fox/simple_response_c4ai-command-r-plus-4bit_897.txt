SUMMARY: In a historic move, the IRS and Treasury Department ruled that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal status with heterosexual couples. This decision ensures that all legally married same-sex couples across the nation can benefit from the same federal tax advantages, protections, and responsibilities, regardless of their state of residence. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew praised the ruling for providing much-needed clarity and coherence in tax filing guidelines for same-sex couples. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin also welcomed the news, stating that gay and lesbian married couples would finally be treated justly under federal tax laws, no longer denied crucial tax benefits due to the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, critics like Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, argued that the decision perpetuates lawlessness and that Congress, not the executive branch, should decide federal tax law.
END OF SUMMARY.
