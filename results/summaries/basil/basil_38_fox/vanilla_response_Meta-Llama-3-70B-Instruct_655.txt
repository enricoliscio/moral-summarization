SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling follows the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new policy applies to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but does not extend to domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the ruling provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" for same-sex couples nationwide. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin hailed the decision as a step towards equality, while opponents, such as National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown, criticized the move as "lawlessness" and an overreach of executive power.
