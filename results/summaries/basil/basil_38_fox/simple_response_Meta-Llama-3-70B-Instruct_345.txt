SUMMARY:

In a historic move, the IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, and ensures that all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, will be treated equally under federal tax law. This ruling provides certainty, access to benefits, and protections that all Americans deserve. Human rights advocates celebrate this decision as a step towards equality, recognizing that loving and committed gay and lesbian couples will now be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. However, opponents argue that this decision continues a pattern of lawlessness and oversteps the administration's authority. This move marks a significant milestone in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, promoting fairness, justice, and equality for all.
