SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal tax benefits to heterosexual married couples. This decision follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules apply nationwide, regardless of individual state recognition of same-sex marriage, and do not include domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and human rights advocates praised the move as a step towards equality, ensuring access to crucial tax benefits and protections for gay and lesbian married couples. However, critics, such as the National Organization of Marriage, argued that the decision oversteps the authority of the executive branch and undermines the role of Congress in determining federal tax law.
END OF SUMMARY.
