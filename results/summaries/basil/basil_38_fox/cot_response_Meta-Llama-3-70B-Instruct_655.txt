SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new policy provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of where they live. According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, this ruling provides access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin hailed the decision, stating that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, finally gaining access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, opponents like Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage argue that this decision continues a pattern of lawlessness and forces same-sex "marriage" on an unwilling public.
