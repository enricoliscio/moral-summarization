Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing same-sex couples to file joint tax returns. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns. This means they get the same benefits as heterosexual couples. It mentions that this announcement came after the Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). There were questions about how the federal government would treat same-sex couples in states that don't recognize gay marriage, but the new rules apply nationwide regardless of where they live. However, domestic partnerships and civil unions aren't covered.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Chad Griffin from the Human Rights Campaign support this move, saying it ensures equality and access to benefits. On the other hand, Brian Brown from the National Organization of Marriage opposes it, calling it lawlessness and arguing that only Congress should decide tax laws.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main point: same-sex couples can now file jointly. Then, mention the Supreme Court's DOMA decision and the nationwide application. Include the exclusion of domestic partnerships and civil unions. Highlight the support from Lew and Griffin, emphasizing equality. Finally, note the opposition from Brown, referencing Congress's role.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all key points without extra details. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each important aspect is covered.
