SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new policy will apply to all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but will not extend to domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew hailed the decision as providing "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" for all legally married same-sex couples. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin celebrated the ruling as a victory for equality, ensuring that "committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples" are treated equally under federal tax laws. However, opponents like National Organization of Marriage President Brian Brown condemned the decision as "lawlessness" and an overreach of executive power.
