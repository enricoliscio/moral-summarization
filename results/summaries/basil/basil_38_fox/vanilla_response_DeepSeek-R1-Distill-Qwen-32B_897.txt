Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. That's a big deal because before, they couldn't get the same benefits as heterosexual couples. 

The article mentions that this announcement came after the Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). DOMA was a law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, so this ruling is a significant change. 

There were questions about how the federal government would treat same-sex couples in states that don't recognize gay marriage. But the new rules apply to all legally married same-sex couples regardless of their state. However, it's important to note that domestic partnerships and civil unions aren't covered by this ruling.

The Treasury Secretary, Jacob Lew, is quoted saying that this provides clarity and tax benefits for same-sex couples. Chad Griffin from the Human Rights Campaign also supports this, calling it a step towards equality. On the other hand, Brian Brown from the National Organization for Marriage is against it, calling it lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage on the public.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: the new IRS rule, the Supreme Court's DOMA decision, the application to all legally married same-sex couples, the exclusion of domestic partnerships and civil unions, the reactions from Lew and Griffin, and the opposing view from Brown. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure this. Start with the announcement, then the background with DOMA, the application regardless of state, the exclusion of other unions, and then the reactions from both supporters and opponents. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.
