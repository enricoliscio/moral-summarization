SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, allowing them to receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn a part of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensuring that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax law. The new rules provide access to benefits, responsibilities, and protections that all Americans deserve, regardless of where they live. This decision finally gives committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples equal treatment under federal tax laws, ending the discrimination they faced under the Defense of Marriage Act. However, not everyone agrees, with some arguing that this decision continues a pattern of lawlessness and forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public. Despite this opposition, the ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide.
