SUMMARY:

The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, allowing them to receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules provide certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples, giving them access to benefits and protections under federal tax law that they deserve. This means that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residence. However, not everyone agrees with the decision, with some arguing that it continues a pattern of lawlessness and forces same-sex "marriage" on an unwilling public. Despite this, the ruling marks a significant step towards equality, ensuring that these families are no longer denied crucial tax benefits and protections.

END OF SUMMARY.
