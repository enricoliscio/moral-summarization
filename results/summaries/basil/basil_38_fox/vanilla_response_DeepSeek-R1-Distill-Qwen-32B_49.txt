Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. They mentioned that this ruling comes after the Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act. 

Hmm, I should note that the decision applies to all legally married same-sex couples regardless of their state of residence. But it doesn't apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions. There are reactions from both supporters and opponents. Supporters like the Human Rights Campaign and opponents like the National Organization for Marriage have different views.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the announcement by IRS and Treasury, the impact of the Supreme Court decision, the application to all legally married same-sex couples, and the reactions from both sides. I should also mention that it doesn't affect domestic partnerships or civil unions.

Let me structure it: Start with the announcement, mention the Supreme Court decision, explain the application regardless of state, note the exclusion of domestic partnerships, include quotes from both supporters and opponents, and end with the significance of the ruling.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without being too detailed. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. Okay, I think that's a solid plan for the summary.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, ensuring they receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules apply to all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state of residence, but do not extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling for providing equality and access to tax benefits. However, opponents like Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage criticized it as "lawlessness" and an overreach by the administration. The ruling marks a significant step toward federal recognition of same-sex marriages. END OF SUMMARY.
