Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about same-sex couples filing joint taxes. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read the article first.

The article talks about the IRS and Treasury allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal taxes. This is after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA. It mentions the benefits for same-sex couples regardless of their state's recognition. There are quotes from Treasury Secretary Lew and Human Rights Campaign's Griffin, who see this as equal treatment. On the flip side, Brian Brown from the National Organization for Marriage opposes it, calling it lawlessness and forced same-sex marriage.

I need to capture both the positive and negative viewpoints. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the moral aspects. So, I'll start by stating the main announcement, then mention the Supreme Court decision and DOMA. Highlight the benefits and the reactions from both supporters and opponents. Make sure to include the key points from each side's quotes. Keep it balanced and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all important elements are covered without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, ensuring they receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new rules apply to all legally married same-sex couples, regardless of their state of residence, though domestic partnerships and civil unions are excluded. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling as a step toward equality, while National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown criticized it as "lawlessness" and an imposition of same-sex marriage on the public. END OF SUMMARY.
