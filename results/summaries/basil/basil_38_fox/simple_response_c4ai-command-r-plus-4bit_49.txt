SUMMARY: In a historic move towards equality, the IRS and Treasury Department ruled that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision ensures that all legally married gay couples across the nation, regardless of their state of residence, are treated with fairness and respect under federal tax laws. The ruling is a direct consequence of the U.S. Supreme Court's earlier strike-down of the Defense of Marriage Act, a discriminatory law that denied same-sex couples their rightful benefits and protections. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin celebrated the ruling, stating that gay and lesbian married couples will finally be treated equally and have access to crucial tax advantages previously denied to them. However, this moral step forward is met with resistance from those who wish to deny same-sex couples their fundamental rights, with the National Organization of Marriage claiming that the decision goes against the will of the people and oversteps the executive branch's authority.

END OF SUMMARY.
