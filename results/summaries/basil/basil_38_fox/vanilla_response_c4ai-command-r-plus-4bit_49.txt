SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples will be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, granting them equal tax benefits to heterosexual married couples. This decision follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules will apply regardless of whether a couple lives in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage or not, but will not extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin have praised the ruling as a step towards equality, while critics like Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage argue that it oversteps the executive branch's authority. This ruling is the latest development in the ongoing debate over same-sex marriage rights in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
