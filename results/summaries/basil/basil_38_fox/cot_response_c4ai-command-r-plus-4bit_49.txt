SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have ruled that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. The new rules provide moral clarity and fairness for all legally married same-sex couples, regardless of their state of residence. They ensure that these couples are treated equally under federal tax law, granting them access to crucial tax benefits previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, this decision has been criticized by some, such as the National Organization of Marriage, as continuing a pattern of lawlessness and disregarding the responsibility of Congress to determine federal tax law. They argue that the Obama administration is forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public. Nevertheless, the ruling is praised by human rights advocates as a step towards equality for committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples across the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
