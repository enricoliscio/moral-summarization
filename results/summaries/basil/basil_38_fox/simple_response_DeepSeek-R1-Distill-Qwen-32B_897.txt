Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the IRS and Treasury Department allowing legally married same-sex couples to file joint federal tax returns. This is a result of the Supreme Court overturning part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The key points are that same-sex couples now have the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples, regardless of where they live. However, this doesn't apply to domestic partnerships or civil unions.

The article also mentions reactions from different groups. The Human Rights Campaign is positive, seeing it as equality and access to benefits. On the other hand, the National Organization for Marriage is against it, viewing it as lawlessness and forced policy on the public.

I need to summarize this in under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects intact. That means highlighting both the progressive stance on equality and the conservative opposition. I should include the main decision, its implications, and the reactions from both sides.

I'll start by stating the announcement from the IRS and Treasury, then mention the Supreme Court's DOMA decision. Next, I'll note the application to all legally married same-sex couples regardless of state, and the exclusion of domestic partnerships. Then, I'll include the positive statements from the Treasury Secretary and Human Rights Campaign, followed by the opposing view from the National Organization for Marriage.

I should make sure the summary is concise and includes all these elements without going over the word limit. Also, I need to present it in a neutral way but preserve the moral framing by showing both supportive and opposing viewpoints.

SUMMARY: The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, granting them the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The new rules apply to all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, regardless of their state's recognition of gay marriage, but do not extend to domestic partnerships or civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised the ruling as a step toward equality and access to previously denied benefits. However, Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage criticized the decision, calling it lawlessness and a forced policy on the public. END OF SUMMARY.
