SUMMARY:
The IRS and Treasury Department have announced that legally married same-sex couples can now file federal joint tax returns, providing them with the same tax benefits as heterosexual couples. This ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The new rules will affect all legally married gay couples, regardless of their state of residence, but will not apply to domestic partnerships and civil unions. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew hailed the decision, saying it provides "certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance" and access to benefits and protections that "all Americans deserve." However, opponents like Brian Brown of the National Organization of Marriage condemned the decision, calling it "lawlessness" and claiming the Obama administration is "forcing same-sex'marriage' on an unwilling public." Despite this, the ruling marks a significant step towards equality for same-sex couples, finally granting them access to "crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act."
