Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and a religious freedom bill. He initially planned to sign it but faced backlash because critics said it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. He wants to change the bill to align more closely with a 1993 federal law. 

I should note the key elements: the bill's intent, the criticism it received, the comparison to Indiana's law, and the pressure from various groups like businesses and human rights organizations. Also, the mention of the White House opposing Indiana's law is important for context.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Hutchinson's decision to seek changes, mention the criticism, his support for the bill's intent but wanting modifications. Then, touch on the comparison to the federal law, the generational gap he mentioned, and the pressure from employers and advocacy groups. Finally, include the White House's stance on Indiana's law to show the broader context.

I should make sure the moral framing is clear: balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination values. That's the core of the debate. I'll structure the summary to highlight this tension and the actions taken by Hutchinson in response to the criticism and pressure.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll check that all important details are included and the moral aspects are emphasized.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has called for changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, citing criticism that it could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson now seeks modifications to align it with a 1993 federal law, emphasizing a "right balance" between religious freedom and non-discrimination. The bill, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest, has sparked nationwide debate, similar to Indiana's recent backlash over its own law. Hutchinson supports the bill's intent but acknowledges a "generational gap," as even his son urged him to veto it. Major employers like Walmart and advocacy groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, have pressured Hutchinson to reject the measure, arguing it could harm economic development and promote discrimination. The White House has also criticized Indiana's law, calling it a "significant expansion" of existing law and contrary to American values. Hutchinson is working on an executive order to address tolerance, reflecting the broader national struggle to balance religious traditions with anti-discrimination principles. END OF SUMMARY.
