SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to make changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but backed off due to nationwide backlash, following a similar controversy in Indiana. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, but critics argue the bill would stifle economic development and reject the values of tolerance and equality. Hutchinson's son even signed a petition urging him to veto the bill, highlighting a "generational gap" in opinions on the issue. The governor is working on an executive order to address tolerance and wants the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. The Human Rights Campaign has run ads targeting technology firms, and the White House has reiterated its opposition to such laws, calling them a "significant expansion" of current law.
