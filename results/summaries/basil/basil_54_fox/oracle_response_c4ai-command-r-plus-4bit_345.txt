SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but changed his stance due to widespread criticism. He aims to strike a "right balance" by amending the bill to more closely resemble a 1993 federal law, while still supporting its intent to protect religious beliefs. The governor acknowledged the need to address provisions that do not "precisely mirror" the federal law and plans to issue an executive order promoting tolerance. The bill has faced opposition from major employers and LGBT rights groups, who argue that it is discriminatory and detrimental to economic development. Similar backlash was seen in Indiana, where a related bill sparked concerns about discrimination. Hutchinson's request for changes reflects a national debate on balancing religious traditions with non-discrimination. The governor's own son also signed a petition urging him to veto the bill, highlighting a "generational gap" in perspectives. Critics have called on Hutchinson to reject the bill outright, while supporters argue it mirrors existing federal and state laws. The White House has expressed opposition to such legislation, emphasizing the need for non-discrimination and calling out false claims of similarity to the 1993 law.
END OF SUMMARY.
