SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation. Despite initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson backed off due to nationwide backlash, echoing the criticism faced by Indiana over a similar law. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, but critics argue the bill could stifle economic development and discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. Top employers, including Wal-Mart, and the Human Rights Campaign have urged Hutchinson to reject the measure. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. Hutchinson aims to address the issue of tolerance through an executive order and wants the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law.
