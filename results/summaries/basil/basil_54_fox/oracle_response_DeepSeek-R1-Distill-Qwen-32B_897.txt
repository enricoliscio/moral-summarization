Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's stance on a religious freedom bill. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included. I need to make sure to use as many of those as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The governor initially planned to sign the bill but faced backlash because it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. He now wants changes to align it with a federal law. Critics argue it's discriminatory, and there's pressure from businesses and the public.

I should start by mentioning Hutchinson urging changes, using "urged" and "changes." Then, note the criticism about discrimination, using "discriminate" and "discrimination." Include that the bill could stifle economic development, using "stifle." Mention the pressure from employers and others to reject the bill, using "reject."

Also, include the comparison to the federal law and the generational gap, using "suggest" and "true." Finally, mention the White House's opposition and the false claims about the law being the same as the federal one, using "true" again.

I need to keep the summary concise, ensuring it flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence includes one or more of the required words.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson faced backlash as criticism mounted, similar to the situation in Indiana. He emphasized the need to strike the "right balance" and align the legislation with a 1993 federal law, urging changes to "remedy" the issue. Critics argued the bill could stifle economic development and discrimination, with major employers like Wal-Mart pressuring Hutchinson to reject it. The governor acknowledged a "generational gap," even noting his own son opposed the bill. Hutchinson also criticized provisions that did not "precisely mirror" the federal law, suggesting the intent was not to discriminate but to replicate existing protections. The White House opposed the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" and false to claim it was the same as the 1993 law. END OF SUMMARY.
