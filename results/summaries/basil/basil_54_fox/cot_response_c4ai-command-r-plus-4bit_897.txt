SUMMARY:
Amid a moral backlash, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to modify a controversial religious freedom bill that critics say could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced criticism for potentially allowing businesses and others to discriminate. The governor seeks to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination while mirroring a 1993 federal law. He wants to address provisions that don't "precisely" align with the federal statute and intends to issue an executive order promoting tolerance. The bill has sparked intense debate, with backers aiming to replicate the federal law and similar statutes in other states. However, critics, including major employers like Wal-Mart, human rights groups, and even Hutchinson's son, have complained that it could lead to discrimination. The White House also opposed the bill, emphasizing its divergence from the 1993 law and highlighting the public outcry against it as a reflection of strong American values. Hutchinson's request for changes underscores the moral dilemma of balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination, reflecting a generational gap in perspectives.
