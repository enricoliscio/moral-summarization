SUMMARY: Amid intense ethical debate, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson requests state lawmakers to amend a controversial religious freedom bill that could enable discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. Hutchinson, who initially intended to sign the bill, now seeks changes to align it with a 1993 federal law. The bill aims to prevent government infringement on religious beliefs but has faced backlash for potentially enabling businesses and others to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The governor acknowledges the need to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination and aims to address provisions that don't mirror the federal law precisely. He also plans to issue an executive order promoting tolerance. This mirrors similar criticism faced by Indiana's religious freedom bill, with both states caught in a nationwide ethical debate on balancing religious freedom with LGBTQ+ rights. The issue highlights a generational gap, with the governor's own son signing a petition against the bill. Pressure from major employers like Wal-Mart and the Human Rights Campaign adds to the urgency for change. The White House also opposes such discriminatory legislation. Governor Hutchinson's decision reflects a moral dilemma faced by many states, seeking to uphold religious freedom while ensuring equal rights for all citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
