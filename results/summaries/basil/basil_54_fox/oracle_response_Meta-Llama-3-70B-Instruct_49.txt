SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to make changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but backed off due to nationwide backlash, echoing the criticism faced by Indiana over a similar law. The governor wants to strike a "right balance" and ensure the bill more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law, prohibiting state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. However, Hutchinson's chief complaint is that some provisions do not "precisely mirror" the federal law, and he wants this addressed. The bill has faced opposition from top employers, including Wal-Mart, who argue it is discriminatory and would stifle economic development. The Human Rights Campaign has also run ads targeting technology firms, urging the governor to reject the measure. The White House has reiterated its opposition to the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law.
