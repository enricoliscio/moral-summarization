SUMMARY:
Amid a backlash over religious freedom legislation, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial bill sent to him, in an attempt to strike the "right balance." The bill, which prohibits government infringement on religious beliefs, has sparked criticism and complaints that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson, facing calls for a veto, wants changes to mirror a 1993 federal law, citing a "generational gap" and the need for tolerance. The debate reflects a national divide on balancing traditions with non-discrimination. Hutchinson's stance comes after similar criticism faced by Indiana and its governor, Mike Pence, who also vowed to clarify their law. The issue has drawn pressure from top employers and rights groups, with the White House opposing such laws as a "significant expansion" of current legislation and indicative of false claims of similarity to the 1993 law.
