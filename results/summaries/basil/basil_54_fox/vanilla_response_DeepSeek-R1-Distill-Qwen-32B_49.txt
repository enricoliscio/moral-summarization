Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are: Hutchinson initially planned to sign a controversial bill but now wants changes. The bill allows businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation, which has caused backlash. He supports the intent but wants it to mirror the 1993 federal law. Critics, including his own son, are against it. Major employers like Wal-Mart are pressuring him, and there's a national debate on balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination laws.

I should make sure the summary includes Hutchinson's stance, the criticism, the changes he wants, and the broader context with Indiana's situation. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Hutchinson's call for changes, mention the criticism, his support for the intent, the need to align with federal law, the pressure from employers and public, and the national debate. Make sure to include key details without getting too wordy.

I think that covers all the essential points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson now wants it amended to align more closely with a 1993 federal law. He supports the bill's intent to protect religious beliefs but acknowledges the need to balance religious freedom with anti-discrimination values. Critics, including his own son, have urged him to veto the measure. Major employers like Wal-Mart and local business groups have also pressured Hutchinson, citing concerns over discrimination and economic impact. The debate reflects a national divide on balancing religious traditions with non-discrimination laws, similar to the controversy surrounding Indiana's religious freedom law. Hutchinson is also working on an executive order to address tolerance, amid calls to clarify the bill's language. END OF SUMMARY.
