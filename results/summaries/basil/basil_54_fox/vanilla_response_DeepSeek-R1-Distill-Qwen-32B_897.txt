Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Governor Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill. The bill was sent to him a day earlier, and there's criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially, he planned to sign it, but then backed off due to backlash, similar to what Indiana faced with their bill.

Hutchinson wants to strike the "right balance." He supports the intent of the bill, which is to prevent the state from infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest, but he wants changes to make it mirror the 1993 federal law. He suggested recalling the bill or passing additional legislation to fix the issues.

There's a debate across state capitals about balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination. Supporters say the bill was meant to replicate the federal law, but critics argue it could allow discrimination. Indiana faced similar criticism, leading their governor to promise to clarify the language.

Hutchinson mentions a generational gap, even his own son urged him to veto the bill. He's working on an executive order about tolerance. He's under pressure from major employers like Wal-Mart, the mayor, Chamber of Commerce, and others. The Human Rights Campaign is running ads against it, targeting tech companies he wants to attract.

The White House opposed the Indiana law, saying it goes against American values and is a significant expansion of current law.

So, the main points are: Hutchinson wants to amend the bill to match the federal law, there's criticism about potential discrimination, support for the intent but concerns over the wording, and economic pressures from businesses and the impact on attracting new companies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key elements: the governor's call for changes, the criticism, the intent of the bill, the comparison to the federal law, the backlash from Indiana, the generational gap, economic pressures, and the White House's stance.

I should structure it logically, starting with Hutchinson's action, the reasons behind it, the criticism, the intent of the bill, the comparison to the federal law, the backlash, and the broader context of similar legislation elsewhere.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and covers all these points without being too detailed. Let me try to put this together.
