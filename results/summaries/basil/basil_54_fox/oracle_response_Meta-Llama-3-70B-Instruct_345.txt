SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to make changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but backed off due to intense backlash, echoing the criticism faced by Indiana over a similar law. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination, but critics argue the bill could stifle economic development and is discriminatory. Top employers, including Wal-Mart, and the Human Rights Campaign have urged Hutchinson to reject the measure. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. Hutchinson wants to remedy the issue by making changes to the bill to ensure it more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law, and is working on an executive order to address tolerance.
