SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, on Wednesday urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, in the face of criticism that it could enable discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but reversed his decision as his state suddenly became the center of a nationwide controversy over similar legislation. The governor aims to strike a "right balance" between religious traditions and non-discrimination. He requests that the bill more closely follow a 1993 federal law, addressing provisions that do not precisely mirror it. Hutchinson faces pressure from top employers and civil rights groups who argue that the bill is discriminatory and detrimental to economic development. The governor's own son even signed a petition urging him to veto the bill, highlighting a generational gap in perspectives. The White House has expressed opposition to similar legislation in Indiana, emphasizing the importance of non-discrimination values. Hutchinson plans to issue an executive order to promote tolerance while working with lawmakers to amend the bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
