SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns about discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced backlash from critics and his own son, who opposed the bill. The bill prohibits the government from infringing on religious beliefs and was intended to mirror a 1993 federal law. However, Hutchinson requested changes to ensure it does not enable discrimination and to promote tolerance. He also mentioned the intense debate in state capitals and the need to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination. The governor faced pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and LGBT rights groups who opposed the bill as discriminatory. Hutchinson's decision reflects a national debate on balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination, with critics arguing that such bills enable discrimination against the LGBT community. The White House also opposed similar legislation in Indiana, highlighting the public outcry against these laws. Hutchinson aims to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, ensuring that the bill does not deviate from the federal law and upholds tolerance.
