SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called on state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns about discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially supported the bill but reversed his position due to intense backlash and criticism. He wants the bill to more closely follow a 1993 federal law that prohibits governments from infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest. Hutchinson acknowledged the balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination, and cited a generational gap in perspectives. He also mentioned that his own son had signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. The governor is working on an executive order to address tolerance and is facing pressure from major employers in the state, including Wal-Mart, who oppose the bill. The Human Rights Campaign has also run ads against the bill. Hutchinson's announcement comes after similar criticism faced by Indiana for their religious freedom bill.
