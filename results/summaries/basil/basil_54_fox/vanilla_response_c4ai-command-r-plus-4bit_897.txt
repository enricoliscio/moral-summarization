SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced intense backlash and pressure from top employers and LGBT rights groups. He requested that the bill be amended to more closely align with a 1993 federal law, ensuring protection for religious beliefs without enabling discrimination. Hutchinson acknowledged the need to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination, citing a "generational gap" in perspectives. He also mentioned that even his son had signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. The governor plans to issue an executive order to promote tolerance and ensure that Arkansas remains welcoming to businesses and individuals. This follows similar controversy in Indiana, where Gov. Mike Pence faced criticism for signing a similar bill and later vowed to clarify the language. The White House also expressed opposition to such legislation, stating that it goes beyond the 1993 law and enables discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
