SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson asked state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially supported the bill but faced intense backlash and pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, to reject it. He wants the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law and address issues of tolerance. The governor cited a "generational gap," even noting that his own son signed a petition against the bill. Hutchinson's request reflects a broader debate in state capitals across the country, with critics arguing that similar laws could enable discrimination. The White House has also expressed opposition to such legislation, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. Meanwhile, Indiana faced similar criticism for its own religious freedom bill, with Gov. Mike Pence vowing to "clarify" the language. Backers of the bills argue they aim to protect religious traditions, but critics worry about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals.
