Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: discriminate, changes, remedy, discrimination, discriminatory, stifle, reject, suggest, true. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson initially planned to sign a religious freedom bill but faced criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. He now wants to change the bill to align with a 1993 federal law. There's opposition from various groups, including businesses and the Human Rights Campaign, who argue the bill is discriminatory and would harm the state's economy. The governor's son even urged him to veto it. The White House also opposes the bill, stating it goes against American values.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Hutchinson's initial stance and the criticism. Then, his desire for changes and the comparison to the federal law. I'll note the opposition from businesses and the governor's son, as well as the White House's stance. I'll use the moral words where appropriate, like "discriminate," "changes," "remedy," "discriminatory," "reject," and "true."

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the governor's stance, the criticism, his proposed changes, the opposition, and the broader implications. I'll make sure each sentence includes the moral framing without making it too forced.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely and the moral words are included naturally. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson faced criticism for a religious freedom bill that critics argued could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson now urges changes to align it with a 1993 federal law, calling for a "right balance" to remedy concerns. Backers claim the bill mirrors federal law, but critics, including major employers like Wal-Mart, argue it is discriminatory and could stifle economic growth. Hutchinson's son even urged him to reject the bill, highlighting a generational gap. The governor aims to address provisions that do not precisely mirror the federal law, while also working on an executive order to promote tolerance. The White House opposes the bill, stating it flies in the face of American values and is a significant expansion of current law. The debate reflects a national divide on balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination, with critics suggesting the bill is not true to its intended purpose. END OF SUMMARY.
