Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article says that Governor Hutchinson initially planned to sign a controversial religious freedom bill but now wants to change it because of criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. This is similar to what happened in Indiana, where their law faced backlash. Hutchinson mentioned that he supports the intent of the bill, which is to protect religious beliefs without infringement, but he wants it to mirror the 1993 federal law. He asked lawmakers to recall the bill or pass additional legislation to fix the issues.

There's also mention of the intense debate across the country about balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination. Backers say they just wanted to replicate the federal law, but critics argue that the Arkansas bill could still allow discrimination, similar to Indiana's. Hutchinson faced pressure from big employers like Wal-Mart and others in Arkansas, who were concerned about economic impact and discrimination.

The White House weighed in, opposing the Indiana law and clarifying that it's not the same as the 1993 federal law. They saw the public outcry as a sign that the legislation goes against American values.

So, the main points are: Hutchinson wants changes to the bill to prevent discrimination, the bill is similar to Indiana's which caused backlash, the governor supports the intent but wants it aligned with federal law, and there's significant opposition from various groups and businesses.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include all these key points. I should structure it to first mention Hutchinson's change in stance, the reason behind it, the comparison to Indiana, his support for the bill's intent, the requested changes, the debate across the country, the pressure from employers, and the White House's opposition.

I should ensure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Let me try to put this together step by step.
