SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced intense backlash and pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart. He wants the bill to more closely follow a 1993 federal law and address the issue of tolerance. The governor cited a generational gap in perspectives on balancing religious traditions with non-discrimination. Hutchinson's announcement reflects similar debates happening across the country, with Indiana also facing criticism for its own religious freedom bill. The White House has expressed opposition to these laws, stating they fly in the face of American values. Hutchinson plans to issue an executive order promoting tolerance, while also working with lawmakers to amend the bill.
END OF SUMMARY.
