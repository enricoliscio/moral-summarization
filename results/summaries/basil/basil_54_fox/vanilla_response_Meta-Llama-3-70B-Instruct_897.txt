SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but backed off due to nationwide backlash, similar to the criticism faced by Indiana. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, and is seeking changes to make the bill more closely mirror a 1993 federal law. Hutchinson cited a "generational gap" in the debate, even noting that his own son signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. The governor is also working on an executive order to address tolerance. Top employers, including Wal-Mart, and LGBTQ rights groups have pressured Hutchinson to reject the measure, which they argue is discriminatory and would harm economic development.
