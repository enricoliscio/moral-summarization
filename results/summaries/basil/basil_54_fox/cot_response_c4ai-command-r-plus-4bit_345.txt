SUMMARY:
In the face of a moral backlash, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill that critics say could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced mounting criticism, including complaints from top employers such as Wal-Mart, who argued that the bill would foster discrimination and hinder economic development. The bill has sparked a moral debate, with supporters aiming to replicate a 1993 federal law and similar laws in other states, while opponents argue that it enables discrimination. Hutchinson acknowledges the need to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination but wants changes to ensure the bill mirrors the federal law precisely. He also plans to issue an executive order promoting tolerance. The controversy mirrors a similar situation in Indiana, where lawmakers and the governor faced intense outcry and vowed to clarify their own religious freedom bill. The White House has opposed such legislation, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling out Gov. Pence for falsely claiming that Indiana's law is the same as the 1993 federal law. The Arkansas bill has also faced criticism from the state's own citizens, including the governor's son, who signed a petition urging a veto.
