SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill that was sent to him, due to criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced intense backlash, similar to the recent controversy over a related bill in Indiana. The governor wants to strike a "right balance" between religious traditions and non-discrimination and has asked for changes to the bill to mirror a 1993 federal law. He cited a "generational gap" in perspectives on the bill, even noting that his own son had signed a petition urging him to veto it. Hutchinson faces pressure from top employers and LGBT rights groups who argue that the bill is discriminatory and will stifle economic development. The White House has also expressed opposition to similar laws, stating that they fly in the face of values strongly supported by Americans. The governor is working on an executive order to address tolerance and has urged lawmakers to "remedy" the issue by recalling the bill or passing additional legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
