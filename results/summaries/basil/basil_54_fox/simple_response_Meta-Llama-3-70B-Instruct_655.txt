SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but faced backlash from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and human rights groups. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination, citing a "generational gap" and his own son's opposition to the bill. He seeks to make the bill more closely mirror a 1993 federal law, addressing concerns that it could stifle economic development and violate American values of tolerance and equality. The White House has also spoken out against similar legislation in Indiana, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. The debate reflects a nationwide struggle to balance religious freedom with the need to protect marginalized communities from discrimination.
