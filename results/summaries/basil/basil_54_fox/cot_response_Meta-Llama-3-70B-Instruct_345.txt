SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. The bill, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest, has faced intense backlash and criticism. Hutchinson wants to strike the "right balance" and has asked for changes to be made to the legislation to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law. The governor has faced pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and the Human Rights Campaign, who argue that the measure is discriminatory and would stifle economic development. The White House has also repeated its opposition to the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. END OF SUMMARY.
