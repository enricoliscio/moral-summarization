SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. The governor initially planned to sign the bill but faced intense backlash and criticism, including from top employers like Wal-Mart, who claim the measure is discriminatory and would stifle economic development. Hutchinson wants to strike the "right balance" and ensure the bill more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law. He cited a "generational gap" and acknowledged that the country is split on how to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to similar legislation in Indiana, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. END OF SUMMARY.
