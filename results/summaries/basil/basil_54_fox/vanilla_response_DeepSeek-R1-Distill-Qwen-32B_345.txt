Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article says that Governor Hutchinson initially planned to sign a controversial religious freedom bill but then urged state lawmakers to change it. The criticism was that the bill could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. This comes after Indiana faced similar backlash for their bill.

Hutchinson mentioned wanting to strike the "right balance" and support the intent of the bill, which is to protect religious beliefs without infringing on them unless there's a compelling interest. He wants the bill to mirror the 1993 federal law. He asked for changes or additional legislation to fix the issue.

There's a debate across the country about balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination. The bill's supporters say it's just replicating the federal law, but critics argue it could enable discrimination. Hutchinson faced pressure from major employers like Wal-Mart and others in Arkansas, similar to Indiana's situation.

The White House opposed the Indiana law, stating it was a significant expansion and not the same as the federal law. They also criticized the governor for misrepresenting the law.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Hutchinson's initial support, the criticism leading him to urge changes, the intent of the bill, the comparison to the 1993 law, the national debate, pressure from employers, and the White House's stance.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, making sure to include all main elements without getting too detailed. I'll start with Hutchinson's call for changes, mention the criticism, the intent of the bill, the comparison to the federal law, the national debate, the pressure from businesses, and the White House's opposition to Indiana's law.

I should also note that the bill's backers aimed to replicate the 1993 law, but critics saw it as enabling discrimination. Hutchinson's son even urged him to veto, highlighting the generational divide. The employers' opposition and the impact on economic development are important points.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, covering each key point succinctly.
