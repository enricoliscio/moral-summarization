Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and a religious freedom bill. The bill was causing controversy because critics say it allows discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially, the governor planned to sign it but then changed his mind after facing backlash, similar to what happened in Indiana. 

The key points are: the bill's intent was to mirror a 1993 federal law, but critics argue it goes further and could enable discrimination. Hutchinson supports the intent but wants changes to match the federal law. He's facing pressure from various groups, including businesses and the public, who are concerned about discrimination and economic impact. The article also mentions the White House opposing the Indiana law, stating it's a significant expansion beyond the federal law.

I need to capture the moral debate here: balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination. It's important to highlight the criticism that the bill could allow discrimination, the governor's stance, and the pressure from different stakeholders. Also, the generational gap and the impact on attracting businesses are moral considerations.

I should structure the summary to include Hutchinson's initial support, his change of stance, the criticism, the intent of the bill, the comparison to the federal law, and the pressure from employers and the public. I'll make sure to mention the moral framing by emphasizing the balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, as well as the economic and social implications.

Now, putting it all together concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and captures all these elements without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has called for changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, amid criticism that it could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson reversed course after facing backlash, similar to the situation in Indiana. He emphasized the need to "strike the right balance" between religious freedom and non-discrimination, stating the bill should align more closely with a 1993 federal law. Hutchinson supports the intent of the legislation, which protects religious beliefs from infringement, but wants to address provisions that do not "precisely mirror" the federal law. Critics argue the bill could allow businesses to discriminate, leading to widespread opposition from employers, including Wal-Mart, and advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign. The governor also cited a "generational gap," noting even his son urged him to veto the bill. The debate highlights the tension between religious traditions and anti-discrimination values, with Hutchinson working on an executive order to promote tolerance. The White House has opposed similar legislation in Indiana, calling it a "significant expansion" of existing law. END OF SUMMARY.
