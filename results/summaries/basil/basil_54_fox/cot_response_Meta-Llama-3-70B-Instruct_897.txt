SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson urged lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill that could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. The bill sparked a nationwide backlash, with critics arguing it infringes upon individual rights. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but backed off, citing a need to strike the "right balance" between religious beliefs and non-discrimination. He wants the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. The governor faces pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and the Human Rights Campaign, who argue the measure is discriminatory and would stifle economic development. The White House also opposes the bill, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law that flies in the face of values that people strongly support. END OF SUMMARY.
