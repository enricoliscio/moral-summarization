SUMMARY: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, has urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill that was sent to him, following criticism that it could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but changed his mind as his state suddenly became the center of a nationwide backlash similar to what Indiana faced with its own religious freedom bill. The governor acknowledged the need to strike a "right balance" between religious traditions and non-discrimination. He requested changes to the bill to more closely align with a 1993 federal law, demonstrating awareness of the intense debate around such legislation nationwide. Hutchinson faced pressure from major employers like Wal-Mart, local organizations, and LGBT rights groups, who all urged him to reject the measure as discriminatory and detrimental to economic development. The White House also opposed similar legislation in Indiana, highlighting the public outcry against these bills that "fly in the face" of American values. Hutchinson's son even signed a petition asking his father to veto the bill, illustrating a "generational gap" in perspectives. The governor plans to issue an executive order to promote tolerance and is working with lawmakers to remedy the issue.
