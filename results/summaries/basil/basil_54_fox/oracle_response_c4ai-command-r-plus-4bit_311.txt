SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced a backlash from critics, including large employers like Wal-Mart, who argued that it would stifle economic development and promote discrimination. The governor acknowledged the need to strike the right balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination and asked for changes to the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law. He suggested recalling the bill or passing additional legislation to remedy the issue. Hutchinson's request reflects a broader debate in state capitals across the country, with backers aiming to replicate the federal law and critics arguing that such bills enable discrimination. The White House also opposed the bill, highlighting the public outcry against similar legislation in Indiana, which has faced similar backlash. The governor plans to issue an executive order to address tolerance and ensure protection for all Arkansans.
