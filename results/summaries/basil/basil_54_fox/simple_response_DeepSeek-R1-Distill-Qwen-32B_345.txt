Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and a religious freedom bill. Let me read through the text carefully.

First, the governor is urging state lawmakers to change the bill because of criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially, he planned to sign it but changed his mind after backlash. This reminds me of what happened in Indiana with a similar law, where they faced criticism too.

Hutchinson wants to strike the right balance, supporting the intent of the bill but wanting changes to mirror the 1993 federal law. He mentioned a generational gap, even his son urged him to veto. There's pressure from big employers like Wal-Mart and others in Arkansas, similar to Indiana's situation where the governor had to clarify the law.

The White House opposed the Indiana law, saying it expanded beyond the 1993 law. The summary needs to capture the moral debate between religious freedom and anti-discrimination, the pressure from various groups, and the comparison to Indiana.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main points: Hutchinson's change of stance, the intent of the bill, the criticism, the comparison to Indiana, the pressure from employers and the White House, and the moral conflict. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has called for changes to a religious freedom bill amid criticism that it could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson now seeks to "strike the right balance," supporting its intent to protect religious beliefs but aligning it with a 1993 federal law. Critics argue the bill could permit businesses to discriminate, similar to Indiana's controversial law. Hutchinson cited a "generational gap," noting even his son urged him to veto. Major employers like Wal-Mart and others in Arkansas have pressured him to reject the measure, while the White House opposed Indiana's law, calling it a "significant expansion" of existing law. The debate reflects a national struggle to reconcile religious freedom with anti-discrimination values. END OF SUMMARY.
