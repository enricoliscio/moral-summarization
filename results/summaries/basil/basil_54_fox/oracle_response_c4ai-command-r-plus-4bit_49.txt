SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced a backlash similar to the one Indiana experienced with its own religious freedom legislation. The governor acknowledged the need to strike a "right balance" between religious traditions and non-discrimination. He requested changes to the bill to more closely align with a 1993 federal law and address provisions that do not "precisely mirror" that law. Hutchinson also mentioned working on an executive order to promote tolerance. The governor faced pressure from major employers and organizations, such as Wal-Mart and the Human Rights Campaign, who viewed the bill as discriminatory and detrimental to economic development. The White House also opposed similar legislation in Indiana, emphasizing the importance of non-discrimination values. Hutchinson's own son even signed a petition urging him to veto the bill, highlighting a "generational gap" in perspectives. The governor's request for changes aims to remedy the issues of discrimination and find a compromise that respects religious freedom while also protecting against unfair treatment.
