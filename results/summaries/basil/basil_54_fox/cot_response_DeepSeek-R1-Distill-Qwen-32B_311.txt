Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words, then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The key points are that the governor is urging changes to the bill because it's controversial. Critics say it allows discrimination based on sexual orientation. The governor initially planned to sign it but faced backlash, similar to what happened in Indiana.

Now, looking for morally framed words. Terms like "controversial," "discriminate," "backlash," "criticism," "balance," "infringing," "compelling interest," "clarify," "discriminatory," "economic development," "tolerance," "values," and "significant expansion" stand out. These words carry moral weight, indicating approval or disapproval.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should mention the governor's initial support, the criticism, his request for changes, and the broader debate. I'll include the impact on businesses and public opinion, using the moral terms identified.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is preserved. I'll start with the governor's call for changes, mention the criticism about discrimination, his support for the intent but wanting it to mirror the federal law, and the pressure from businesses and the public. I'll also note the White House's opposition to the Indiana law as context.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting the governor's actions with the moral implications and the reactions from different stakeholders. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure all the key points are covered and that the moral terms are included appropriately. This should provide a clear, concise summary that reflects the moral framing of the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called for changes to a controversial religious freedom bill amid criticism that it could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson faced backlash similar to Indiana's situation, where a related law sparked nationwide criticism. He emphasized the need to strike the "right balance" and align the bill with a 1993 federal law. Hutchinson supported the bill's intent to protect religious beliefs but criticized provisions that did not "precisely mirror" federal law. He also faced pressure from major employers, including Wal-Mart, and public figures urging him to reject the measure. The debate highlights the tension between religious freedom and non-discrimination, with the governor acknowledging a "generational gap" in opinions. The White House opposed the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" of existing law, and criticized efforts to equate it with the 1993 federal law. Hutchinson's decision to seek changes reflects the intense national debate over balancing religious traditions with anti-discrimination values.
