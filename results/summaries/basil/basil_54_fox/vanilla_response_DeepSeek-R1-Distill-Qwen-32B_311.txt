Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and a religious freedom bill. He initially planned to sign it but then changed his mind due to criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. This is similar to what happened in Indiana, where a similar bill caused a backlash.

Hutchinson wants to balance religious freedom with non-discrimination. He supports the intent of the bill but wants it to mirror a 1993 federal law. He asked lawmakers to revise the bill. Critics, including his own son, oppose it, and major employers like Wal-Mart pressured him to veto it.

The White House also opposed the Indiana law, saying it expanded beyond the 1993 law. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should structure it by mentioning Hutchinson's initial stance, the criticism, his call for changes, the comparison to Indiana, and the pressure from various groups. Keep it clear and within the word limit.
