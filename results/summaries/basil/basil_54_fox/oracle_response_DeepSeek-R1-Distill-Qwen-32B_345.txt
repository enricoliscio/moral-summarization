Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should focus on certain morally charged words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and a religious freedom bill. He initially planned to sign it but then decided to urge changes because of criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. The bill's intent was to mirror a 1993 federal law, but critics say it could lead to discrimination. Hutchinson wants to strike the right balance and make changes to remedy the issue, similar to what Indiana did. There's pressure from employers and the public, including his own son urging him to veto. The White House also opposes the bill, calling it discriminatory and against American values.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The key morally framed words are: discriminate, changes, remedy, discrimination, discriminatory, stifle, reject, suggest, true. I should include these where appropriate.

I'll start by stating that Hutchinson urged changes to the bill to prevent discrimination. Mention the initial support and then the criticism. Highlight the intent to mirror the 1993 law but concerns about discrimination. Note the pressure from employers and public, including his son. Also, include the White House's opposition and the comparison to Indiana's law.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: introduce the governor's action, the initial intent, the criticism, the call for changes, the pressure faced, and the broader context with the White House's stance.

I'll make sure to use the specified moral words naturally in the summary without forcing them. That should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the moral framing as the author intended.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to make changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson faced backlash as criticism mounted, similar to the situation in Indiana. He emphasized the need to strike the "right balance" and ensure the legislation mirrors the 1993 federal law, which prohibits infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest. Hutchinson called for changes to remedy the issue, acknowledging a "generational gap" even within his own family, as his son urged him to reject the bill. Critics, including major employers like Wal-Mart and advocacy groups, argue the bill is discriminatory and could stifle economic development. The White House also opposed the measure, stating it flies in the face of values supporting non-discrimination. Hutchinson remains committed to the bill's intent but wants to address provisions that do not precisely mirror the federal law. END OF SUMMARY.
