SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to make changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. The governor, who initially planned to sign the bill, has backed off amid a nationwide backlash, including pressure from top employers such as Wal-Mart, who claim the measure is discriminatory and would stifle economic development. Hutchinson wants to strike the "right balance" and ensure the bill more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. The governor's chief complaint is that some provisions do not "precisely mirror" the federal law, and he wants that addressed. He is also working on an executive order to promote tolerance. The White House has repeated its opposition to similar legislation in Indiana, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law that "flies in the face of values that people all across America strongly support."
