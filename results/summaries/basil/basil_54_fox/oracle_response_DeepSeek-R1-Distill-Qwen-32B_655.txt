Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the words the author used, such as "discriminate," "changes," "remedy," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "stifle," "reject," "suggest," and "true." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Governor Hutchinson initially wanted to sign a religious freedom bill but faced criticism that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. He then called for changes to align it with the 1993 federal law. Backers say the bill was meant to mirror the federal law, but critics argue it could lead to discrimination. There's also mention of pressure from businesses and the White House opposing similar legislation in Indiana.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words. I'll start by stating Hutchinson's initial stance and the criticism about discrimination. Then, mention his call for changes and the intent of the bill. I'll note the opposition from businesses and the White House, using words like "stifle" and "reject." I should also highlight the generational gap and the pressure from his son, as that adds a personal moral angle. Finally, I'll conclude by emphasizing the debate over balancing religious freedom and non-discrimination.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the specified moral terms. I'll structure it to cover the key points: initial support, criticism, call for changes, opposition, and the ongoing debate. This way, the summary preserves the author's moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson initially planned to sign a controversial religious freedom bill but faced criticism that it could allow businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation. He called for changes to align the bill with a 1993 federal law, urging state lawmakers to "remedy" its provisions. Backers claimed the bill aimed to replicate the federal law, but critics argued it could enable discrimination. Hutchinson, amid pressure from employers like Wal-Mart and local leaders, emphasized the need to strike a "right balance" between religious freedom and non-discrimination. He cited a "generational gap," noting even his son urged him to reject the bill. The governor also faced criticism from the White House, which opposed Indiana's similar law, calling it "discriminatory" and a "significant expansion" of current law. The debate highlights the nation's struggle to balance religious traditions with anti-discrimination values. END OF SUMMARY.
