Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used, specifically using the words they provided: discriminate, changes, remedy, discrimination, discriminatory, stifle, reject, suggest, true. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The governor initially planned to sign the bill but faced criticism that it allows discrimination based on sexual orientation. He now wants changes to mirror the 1993 federal law. There's a debate about balancing religious freedom with non-discrimination. Backers say it's just replicating the federal law, but critics argue it could allow discrimination. Employers like Walmart and others pressured him to reject the bill. The White House also opposed the Indiana version, saying it's a significant expansion.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words. So, I'll mention the bill allowing businesses to discriminate, the need for changes and remedy, the discrimination issue, the discriminatory measure, how it stifle economic development, the pressure to reject the bill, the suggestion that it's the same as the federal law, and the truth that it's not the same.

I should structure the summary to cover the governor's initial stance, the criticism, his call for changes, the debate, the pressure from employers, and the White House's opposition. I'll make sure to use the moral terms as much as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me check if I'm including all the required words: discriminate, changes, remedy, discrimination, discriminatory, stifle, reject, suggest, true. I think I can incorporate all of them naturally into the summary.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the governor urging changes to the bill to prevent discrimination. Then, note the criticism and his intent to balance religious freedom. Include the need for changes to mirror the federal law. Mention the pressure from employers and the White House's stance. Finally, tie it all together with the debate on balancing values.

I think that covers all the points and includes the moral framing words. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called for changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, urging state lawmakers to "remedy" provisions that could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson faced backlash as critics argued it could permit businesses to discriminate. He emphasized the need to strike a "right balance" between religious freedom and non-discrimination, aligning the legislation with a 1993 federal law. Hutchinson acknowledged a "generational gap," even as his own son urged him to veto the bill. The governor also faced pressure from major employers like Wal-Mart, which warned the measure was discriminatory and would stifle economic development. The White House opposed the bill, stating it "flies in the face of values" many Americans support. Hutchinson's call for changes reflects the nationwide debate over balancing religious traditions with anti-discrimination protections, as critics argue the bill does not "precisely mirror" federal law and could suggest a broader expansion of rights. END OF SUMMARY.
