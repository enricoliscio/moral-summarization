SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a religious freedom bill that has sparked controversy over concerns it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially, Hutchinson planned to sign the bill, but after facing backlash, he wants to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination. The governor supports the bill's intent, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest, but wants changes to mirror a 1993 federal law. Critics, including top employers like Wal-Mart, argue the bill is discriminatory and would harm economic development. The Human Rights Campaign has also targeted technology firms in ads, urging the governor to reject the measure. The controversy echoes the backlash faced by Indiana over a similar law, with the White House reiterating its opposition to such legislation.
