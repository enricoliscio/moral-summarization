SUMMARY:
In the face of intense criticism and backlash, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill that was sent to him. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but changed his mind due to concerns about discrimination based on sexual orientation. The governor aims to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination while addressing provisions that do not align with the 1993 federal law. He faces pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and LGBT rights groups who argue that the bill is discriminatory and detrimental to economic development. The White House also opposes similar legislation in Indiana, highlighting the significant expansion of current law and the public outcry against it. Hutchinson's own son even signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. The governor is working on an executive order to promote tolerance and address the issue.
