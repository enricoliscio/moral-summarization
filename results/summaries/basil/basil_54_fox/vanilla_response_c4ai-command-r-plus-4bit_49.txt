SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns about discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but faced intense backlash and pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart. He wants the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law and address the issue of tolerance. The governor cited a "generational gap," even noting that his own son had signed a petition against the bill. Hutchinson asked lawmakers to recall the bill or pass additional legislation to "remedy" the issue. The bill was passed by the state legislature, but Hutchinson's request for changes reflects a nationwide debate on balancing religious traditions with non-discrimination. The White House also opposed similar legislation in Indiana, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. Critics argue that these bills allow discrimination by businesses and others based on sexual orientation. Backers claim they replicate the 1993 federal law and similar laws in other states. Hutchinson plans to issue an executive order to address tolerance and is working with lawmakers to make changes to the bill.
