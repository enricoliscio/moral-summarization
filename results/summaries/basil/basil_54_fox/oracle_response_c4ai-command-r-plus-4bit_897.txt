SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced intense backlash and pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, who argued that the bill was discriminatory and would hinder economic development. The bill intends to replicate a 1993 federal law that prohibits governments from infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest. However, Hutchinson seeks changes to ensure it does not enable discrimination and to address the issue of tolerance. He asked lawmakers to recall the bill or pass additional legislation to remedy the issue. The governor acknowledged a generational gap in perspectives on balancing religious traditions with non-discrimination and even faced opposition from his son, who signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. Hutchinson's request reflects a broader debate in state capitals across the country, with critics suggesting that such bills enable discrimination and stifle progress. The White House also opposed similar legislation in Indiana, emphasizing the importance of non-discrimination values.
END OF SUMMARY.
