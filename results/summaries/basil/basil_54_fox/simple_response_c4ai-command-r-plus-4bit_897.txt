SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is facing a moral dilemma over a controversial religious freedom bill that has sparked intense debate and criticism. On Wednesday, he urged state lawmakers to change the bill to strike a "right balance" between religious traditions and non-discrimination. Hutchinson's initial support for the bill mirrored the intentions of backers in 19 other states and a 1993 federal law, which aimed to protect religious beliefs from government infringement. However, the bill has faced strong opposition from critics who argue it could enable discrimination against the LGBT community. Even Hutchinson's son signed a petition against it. Hutchinson now requests that lawmakers recall the bill or pass additional legislation to address the concerns and mirror the federal law more closely. The governor also plans to issue an executive order promoting tolerance. The controversy echoes the backlash faced by Indiana over a similar law, with companies like Wal-Mart and Acxiom, and organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, speaking out against it. The White House has also expressed opposition to such discriminatory legislation. Hutchinson's challenge highlights the complex ethical and moral questions surrounding religious freedom and non-discrimination.
