SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill that critics argue could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Despite initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson backed off due to nationwide backlash, echoing the criticism faced by Indiana over similar legislation. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination, but critics argue the bill's provisions do not precisely mirror the 1993 federal law. Top employers, including Wal-Mart, and LGBTQ+ rights groups have pressured Hutchinson to reject the measure, citing concerns over discrimination and economic development. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to such laws, calling them a "significant expansion" of current law. Hutchinson's decision reflects the intense debate across the country, highlighting the need to balance religious beliefs with the values of tolerance and non-discrimination.
