SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill, acknowledging that it could enable discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but faced a swift backlash similar to the criticism Indiana received for its own religious freedom bill. The governor aims to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination. He requested that the bill be amended to align more closely with a 1993 federal law, ensuring protection for religious beliefs without promoting discrimination. Hutchinson acknowledged the divide between generations on this issue, even revealing that his own son signed a petition against the bill. He intends to issue an executive order promoting tolerance. The governor has faced pressure from major employers, such as Wal-Mart, and LGBTQ+ rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign, who argue that the bill fosters discrimination. Hutchinson's decision reflects a broader debate in state capitals across the country, navigating between religious freedom and non-discrimination.
