SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to change a religious freedom bill that critics say could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially planned to sign the bill but backed off due to nationwide backlash. He wants to strike a balance between religious beliefs and non-discrimination, and is seeking changes to make the bill more closely mirror a 1993 federal law. The governor is working on an executive order to address tolerance and has faced pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, to reject the measure. The Human Rights Campaign has run ads targeting technology firms to attract to the state. The White House has also opposed the Indiana law, saying it "flies in the face of values that people all across America strongly support."
