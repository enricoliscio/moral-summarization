Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. The user also wants me to identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral framings. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about a bill that's causing controversy because critics say it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. The governor initially planned to sign it but is now asking for changes to align it with a 1993 federal law. There's a lot of pushback from various groups, including businesses and the Human Rights Campaign.

Now, for step one, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. These are words that have a positive or negative connotation in the context of the article. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

- Controversial: implies disagreement or debate, which is a moral framing.
- Discriminate: clearly negative, as it refers to unfair treatment.
- Criticism: suggests disapproval, a moral stance.
- Veto: a political action but in this context, it's about rejecting a bill, which has moral implications.
- Oppose: indicates disagreement, a moral stance.
- Discriminatory: negative, implies unfairness.
- Focal point: not inherently moral, but in context, it's about the center of criticism, so it's framed morally.
- Backlash: negative reaction, implying something wrong.
- Compelling interest: a legal term but in moral terms, it's about what's important enough to override rights.
- Generational gap: implies a divide in values, a moral issue.
- Pressure: suggests influence due to moral concerns.
- Discriminatory: again, negative.
- Stifle: negative, as it's hindering progress.
- False: implies deception, a moral failing.
- Indicative: shows something, but in context, it's about the bill conflicting with values.
- Strongly support: positive, showing approval.
- Falsely: implies lying or misleading, a moral issue.
- Significant expansion: implies a major change, which could be seen as overstepping.
- Clarify: suggests fixing a moral issue.
- Attracts: positive, but in context, it's about bringing in businesses, which is a positive goal.
- Fly in the face: negative, as it's going against values.
- Opposes: negative stance.
- Erodes: implies weakening, negative.
- Compelling: as before, but in a negative context here.
- Uphold: positive, maintaining standards.
- Discrimination: negative.
- Opposes: negative stance.
- Falsely: again, implies misleading.
- Discriminatory: negative.
