SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill that critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Despite initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson backed off due to nationwide backlash, following Indiana's similar experience. The governor wants to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, and is seeking changes to make the bill more closely mirror a 1993 federal law. Hutchinson's announcement reflects the intense debate across the country, with backers arguing the bill simply replicates existing laws, while critics see it as discriminatory. The governor has faced pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and the Human Rights Campaign has run ads targeting technology firms. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to the Indiana law, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law.
