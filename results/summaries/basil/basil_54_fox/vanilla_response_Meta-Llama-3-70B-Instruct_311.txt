SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson initially intended to sign the bill but backed off due to nationwide backlash. He wants the bill to more closely mirror a 1993 federal law, prohibiting state and local governments from infringing on religious beliefs without a compelling interest. The governor faces pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and LGBTQ+ rights groups, who argue the bill is discriminatory and would harm economic development. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to similar legislation in Indiana. Hutchinson aims to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination, citing a "generational gap" in opinions on the issue.
