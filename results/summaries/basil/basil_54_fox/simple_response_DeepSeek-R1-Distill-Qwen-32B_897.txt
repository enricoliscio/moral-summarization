Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and the religious freedom bill. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Governor Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill. The criticism is that the bill could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Initially, he planned to sign it, but faced backlash, making Arkansas a focal point like Indiana was. Indiana had a similar situation with their bill.

Hutchinson wants to strike the right balance and supports the intent of the bill, which is to protect religious beliefs without infringement unless there's a compelling interest. But he wants changes to make it mirror the 1993 federal law. He mentioned a generational gap, even his son urged him to veto. There's pressure from big employers like Wal-Mart and others in Arkansas. The White House also opposed the Indiana law, saying it's not the same as the 1993 law and is a significant expansion.

So, the moral framing here is about balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination. The bill's critics argue it could enable discrimination, while supporters say it's about protecting religious beliefs. The governor is trying to amend the bill to avoid backlash and align with federal law, but there's a clear divide in the country on this issue.

I need to capture that the governor is trying to balance these two moral values, the criticism from both sides, and the broader context of similar legislation in other states. I should also mention the economic pressures from major employers and the White House's stance.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key elements: the governor's initial stance, the criticism, the intent of the bill, the desire to align with federal law, the generational gap, economic pressures, and the broader debate.

I should structure it to first mention the governor's call for changes, then the criticism about discrimination, his support for the intent, the comparison to the federal law, the pressure from employers and the White House, and the ongoing debate.

Let me draft that, making sure it's clear and captures the moral aspects.
