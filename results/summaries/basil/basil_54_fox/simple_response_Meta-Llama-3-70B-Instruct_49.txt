SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has backtracked on his initial plan to sign a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could lead to discrimination based on sexual orientation. Amidst intense backlash, Hutchinson urged state lawmakers to revise the bill to ensure it mirrors a 1993 federal law, which prohibits government infringement on religious beliefs without a compelling interest. Critics, including top employers and the Human Rights Campaign, argue that the bill could stifle economic development and discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. The governor's decision reflects a nationwide debate on balancing religious traditions with non-discrimination, with many arguing that such laws are a step backward for civil rights. Hutchinson's call for changes aims to strike a balance between religious freedom and tolerance, but the move is seen as a response to public outcry and pressure from major businesses.
