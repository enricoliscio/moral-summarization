SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. The bill, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest, has sparked intense debate and backlash nationwide. Hutchinson wants to strike the "right balance" and ensure the bill mirrors a 1993 federal law, citing a "generational gap" in understanding. The governor faces pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, and the Human Rights Campaign, who argue the measure is discriminatory and would stifle economic development. The White House has also reiterated its opposition to similar legislation in Indiana, calling it a "significant expansion" of current law. Hutchinson is working on an executive order to address tolerance and hopes to attract technology firms to the state. END OF SUMMARY.
