SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to make changes to a controversial religious freedom bill, citing concerns that it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. The bill, which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest, has faced intense backlash across the country. Critics argue that it could lead to discrimination by businesses, stifle economic development, and reject the values of tolerance and non-discrimination. Hutchinson, who initially planned to sign the bill, now wants to strike a balance between religious traditions and non-discrimination. He has called for changes to be made to the bill to remedy the issue, citing a "generational gap" and pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart, who have complained that the measure is discriminatory. The Human Rights Campaign has also run ads targeting technology firms, urging the governor to reject the measure.
