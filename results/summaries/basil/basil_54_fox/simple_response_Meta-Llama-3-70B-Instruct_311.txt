SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has urged state lawmakers to revise a controversial religious freedom bill, which critics argue could allow businesses to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. Despite initially planning to sign the bill, Hutchinson backed off due to nationwide backlash, following Indiana's similar experience. He wants to strike a balance between religious freedom and non-discrimination, citing a "generational gap" and pressure from top employers, including Wal-Mart. The governor aims to make the bill more closely mirror a 1993 federal law, and is also working on an executive order to promote tolerance. The White House has reiterated its opposition to such laws, stating they contradict values strongly supported by Americans. The debate highlights the struggle to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination, with Hutchinson's son even signing a petition urging the governor to veto the bill.
