Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson dealing with a religious freedom bill. He initially planned to sign it but faced backlash because critics said it could allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. He wants to change the bill to align it more closely with a 1993 federal law. He supports the intent of the bill, which is to protect religious beliefs, but he's concerned some provisions don't exactly mirror the federal law. He's also facing pressure from major employers and the business community, who are worried about the bill's impact on economic development.

I need to capture the moral aspects, like the tension between religious freedom and anti-discrimination. The summary should mention the criticism from groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the White House, as well as the pressure from businesses. It's important to highlight that the governor wants to balance these values and that there's a generational divide, as his own son opposes the bill.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the governor and the bill, then the criticism and his response, followed by the pressure from various groups, and conclude with the broader debate. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and making sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll use clear and concise language to convey the main points effectively.
