SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders have condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's remarks that the war in Afghanistan is "unwinnable" and a "war of Obama's choosing". Bill Kristol, a prominent conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, labeling the comments an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers "fighting" to accomplish the mission. Kristol argued that Steele's statement is "inconsistent" with the party's stance and undermines the efforts of Republicans who are "pushing" for a clean war funding resolution and "rallying" citizens behind the mission. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible". Steele's remarks have sparked irony, as they resonate with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, but as RNC Chairman, his words are seen as a betrayal of the party's commitment to the war effort. Kristol's call for resignation has sparked a push to oust Steele, whose tenure is once again under scrutiny.

END OF SUMMARY.
