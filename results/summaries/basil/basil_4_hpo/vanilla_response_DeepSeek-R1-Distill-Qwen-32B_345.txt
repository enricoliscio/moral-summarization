Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, facing backlash from conservatives after he made some comments about the Afghanistan war. 

He was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. That's the main point. Now, prominent conservatives like Bill Kristol and Dan Senor are reacting negatively. Kristol wrote a letter calling for Steele's resignation, pointing out that the war started under Bush and was supported by Republicans. He also mentions that Steele's statement goes against the party's stance and is embarrassing.

Steele's spokesman tried to clarify that Steele meant Obama hasn't had a clear strategy, not that the war was his choice. But Kristol and others weren't buying it. Senor called the comments irresponsible, especially since the RNC had previously supported Obama's surge in Afghanistan. 

Steele's past statements are inconsistent too; he had earlier said the war is one we have to win. His recent comments are resonating with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but since he's the RNC chairman, his position is shaky. Kristol's call for resignation is getting traction, and GOP operatives are pushing the story further.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Steele's comments and the backlash, then Kristol's letter, the clarification, Senor's reaction, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, and the impact on his position. I should make sure to include key points like the war's history, the support from Republicans, the inconsistency, and the resulting pressure on Steele.

Let me structure it step by step. First, introduce Steele's comments. Then, the reactions from Kristol and Senor. Mention the clarification and past statements. Highlight the inconsistency and the fact that his comments are resonating with others. Finally, note the impact on his position and the efforts to spread the story.

I should avoid getting too detailed and keep it concise. Make sure it flows well and covers all the main points without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it now, keeping each sentence focused on one main idea.
