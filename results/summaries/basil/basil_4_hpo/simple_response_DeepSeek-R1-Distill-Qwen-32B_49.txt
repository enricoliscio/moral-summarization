Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making a comment that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. Conservatives, including Bill Kristol, reacted negatively, with Kristol calling for Steele's resignation. He argues that the war wasn't Obama's choice and that Republicans have supported it. Kristol's letter emphasizes the embarrassment and affront to the party and soldiers.

Steele's spokesman tried to clarify that Steele meant Obama hasn't shown a winning strategy, not that the war was his choice. But Kristol and others like Dan Senor criticized Steele for inconsistency. Senor noted that Steele had previously supported the surge and now contradicted himself.

Interestingly, Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but he's a Republican leader, making his stance problematic. His tenure seems shaky now, especially after Kristol's call for resignation, and a GOP operative is spreading the story.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems to be about loyalty, consistency, and respect for the party and soldiers. Steele's comments are seen as disloyal and inconsistent, damaging the party's stance on the war.

Now, I'll structure the summary: mention Steele's comment, the negative reactions, Kristol's harsh response, the inconsistency with Steele's previous statements, the resonance with anti-war groups, and the impact on his position.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to highlight the moral implications as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced backlash after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by President Obama. Critics, including influential conservative voices like Bill Kristol, accused Steele of disloyalty and inconsistency, as Republicans have long supported the war effort under both Bush and Obama. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing his comments were an affront to the party and U.S. soldiers. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify that his remark was about Obama's lack of a winning strategy, not the war's origins. However, Steele's past support for the Afghan surge and his recent contradictory statements drew criticism from figures like Dan Senor, who labeled his comments "utterly irresponsible." While Steele's views resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, his position as RNC chairman made his stance particularly problematic. His tenure appears increasingly precarious as the controversy gains traction. END OF SUMMARY.
