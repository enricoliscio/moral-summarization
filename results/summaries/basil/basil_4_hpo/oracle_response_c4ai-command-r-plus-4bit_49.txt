SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives offered swift and negative reactions to RNC chairman Michael Steele on Friday after he was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele’s resignation in a letter published on his Weekly Standard site. Kristol argued that the war in Afghanistan has been prosecuted under both Presidents Bush and Obama and that Republicans have consistently supported the effort. He criticized Steele’s comment as an “affront” to the Republican Party and to the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they have been asked to take on. Other conservative figures, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele’s comments as “irresponsible” and inconsistent with the RNC’s previous support for the war effort. Steele’s most recent comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan war, but they have put him at odds with the majority of the Republican Party.
END OF SUMMARY.
