Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Michael Steele's comments on the Afghanistan war, the reactions from conservatives, and the implications for his position. The key morally charged words include "war," "prosecuted," "pushing," "rally," "affront," "fighting," "irresponsible," "escalate," "engage," "failed," and "inconsistent."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. I'll start by identifying the main events: Steele's statement, the negative reactions, Kristol's harsh letter, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, and the support from anti-war Democrats.

I should structure the summary to include all these elements concisely. I'll make sure to mention the war's prosecution under Bush and Obama, the pushback from Republicans, the affront to the party and soldiers, the irresponsibility, the escalation efforts, the inconsistency, and the resonance with anti-war groups.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary, making sure the summary flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Michael Steele, RNC chairman, faced backlash after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war "of Obama’s choosing." Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol, condemned his remarks, with Kristol calling for Steele’s resignation. Kristol accused Steele of affronting the Republican Party and U.S. soldiers, emphasizing that the war has been prosecuted under both Bush and Obama. Steele’s spokesman clarified his comments, stating Steele meant Obama lacked a clear strategy, but critics like Dan Senor labeled his remarks "utterly irresponsible." Senor noted Steele had previously declared Afghanistan a "war we have to win," highlighting the inconsistency in his statements. Steele’s comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but as the Republican figurehead, his stance was seen as a betrayal of party unity. The controversy underscores divisions over U.S. engagement in Afghanistan, with Steele’s tenure appearing increasingly precarious. END OF SUMMARY.
