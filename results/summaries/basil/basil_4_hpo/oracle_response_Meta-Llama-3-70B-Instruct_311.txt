SUMMARY:

Prominent conservatives swiftly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's statement that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, saying his comment was "an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they've been asked to take on by our elected leaders." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but Kristol and others, including neoconservative Dan Senor, deemed it "utterly irresponsible" and "completely inconsistent" with Steele's previous statements supporting the war effort. Steele's words resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky. Kristol's call for resignation sparked a push for Steele's removal, with a GOP operative pitching the story to reporters.

END OF SUMMARY.
