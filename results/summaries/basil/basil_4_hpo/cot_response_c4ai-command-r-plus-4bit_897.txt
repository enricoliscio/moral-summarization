SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made controversial comments about the war in Afghanistan, stating that it is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. His remarks sparked swift and harsh backlash from prominent conservatives, who viewed them as an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were "embarrassing" and inconsistent with the party's stance on the war. Other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, echoed similar sentiments, calling Steele's comments "irresponsible." Steele's tenure as RNC chairman has been marked by controversy, and his recent remarks have only added to his "troubles." While his comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan war, Steele's position as the figurehead of the Republican Party leaves him vulnerable to criticism for his inconsistent and ill-advised remarks. The pushback against Steele's comments underscores the divide within the Republican Party on the issue of the war in Afghanistan and raises questions about Steele's ability to effectively lead the party.
