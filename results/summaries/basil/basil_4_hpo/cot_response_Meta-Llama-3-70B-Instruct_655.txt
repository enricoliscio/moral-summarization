SUMMARY:
Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, have called for RNC Chairman Michael Steele's resignation after he stated that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Kristol deemed Steele's comment an "affront" to the Republican Party's "honor" and the "commitment" of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor labeled Steele's statement "utterly irresponsible." The backlash comes as Steele's comment contradicts his previous stance that Afghanistan is a war that must be won. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but Kristol and Senor were unswayed. The controversy has sparked irony, as Steele's comment has resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the war. However, as RNC Chairman, Steele's "irresponsible" comment has put his tenure in jeopardy. END OF SUMMARY.
