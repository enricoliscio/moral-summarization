SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders swiftly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's statement that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a prominent voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, saying his comment was "an affront" to the honor of the Republican Party and the commitment of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol emphasized that Republicans have consistently supported the war effort, and Steele's statement puts him at odds with the party. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, labeled Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible" and pointed out the inconsistency with Steele's previous statement that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but Kristol and Senor were unforgiving, saying Steele's words were an embarrassment to the party and undermined the war effort. Steele's tenure as RNC chairman appears shaky as a result.

END OF SUMMARY.
