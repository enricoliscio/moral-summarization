Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, first, I need to read the article carefully to understand the context and the main points.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making a comment that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. Conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, are reacting negatively. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, emphasizing that the war was supported by Republicans under both Bush and Obama. Senor added that Steele's comments were inconsistent with his previous statements supporting the war.

I should note the key points: Steele's comment, the reactions from Kristol and Senor, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, and the irony that anti-war Democrats agree with him. Also, the article mentions that Steele's position is shaky because of this.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. That means I should highlight the criticism from within the Republican party, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, and the broader implications for the party's stance on the war.

I need to make sure the summary is concise but includes all these elements. Let me structure it: start with Steele's comment, then the reactions from Kristol and Senor, mention the inconsistency, note the anti-war Democrats' agreement, and conclude with the impact on Steele's position.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced sharp criticism from prominent conservatives after stating that the war in Afghanistan is largely unwinnable and "a war of Obamaâ€™s choosing." Bill Kristol, a influential Republican voice, condemned Steele's remarks, calling them an "affront" to the party and its support for the war under both Bush and Obama. Kristol demanded Steele's resignation, emphasizing that Republicans have consistently backed the mission. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, labeled Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible," noting that they contradicted his earlier support for the war. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify that his statement referred to Obama's lack of a clear strategy, but critics pointed out that Steele had previously declared Afghanistan "a war we have to win." The controversy has drawn attention from anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, though Steele's position as RNC chairman has come under fire, with GOP operatives seeking to amplify the backlash. END OF SUMMARY.
