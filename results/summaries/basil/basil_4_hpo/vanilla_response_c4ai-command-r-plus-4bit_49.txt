SUMMARY: Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, strongly criticized Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a war of President Obama's choosing. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an embarrassment and an affront to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor, a neoconservative figure and booster of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, also criticized Steele's comments as irresponsible and inconsistent with the RNC's previous support for the war effort. Steele's spokesman tried to clarify his comments, but the damage was done, and his tenure as RNC chairman once again appears shaky. The irony is that Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative pundits who share his skepticism about the war, even though he is not an anti-war Democrat or a pundit himself.
END OF SUMMARY.
