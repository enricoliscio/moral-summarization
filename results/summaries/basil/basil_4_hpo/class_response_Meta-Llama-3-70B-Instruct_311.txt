SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders slammed RNC Chairman Michael Steele for saying the Afghanistan war is "unwinnable" and "of Obama's choosing". Bill Kristol, a prominent Republican voice, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers "fighting" to accomplish the mission. Kristol argued that Steele's statement is "inconsistent" with the party's consistent support for the war effort. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's comment "utterly irresponsible". Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the remark, saying he meant Obama lacks a winning strategy, but Kristol and Senor were unmoved. The backlash is particularly notable given Steele's past statements, including his declaration that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win". The controversy has sparked debate among anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, but Steele's position as RNC leader appears precarious.

END OF SUMMARY.
