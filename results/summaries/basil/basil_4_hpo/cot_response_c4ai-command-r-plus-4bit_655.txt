SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, faced harsh criticism from prominent conservatives after expressing skepticism about the war in Afghanistan. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, called for Steele's resignation, condemning his comments as an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol's reaction was the harshest, but other neoconservatives joined in, with Dan Senor calling Steele's comments "irresponsible." Steele's spokesperson tried to clarify the remarks, but the damage was done. The incident highlights Steele's inconsistent stance on the war and his shaky tenure as the Republican figurehead. It also exposes the internal divisions within the Republican Party, with some conservatives sharing Steele's skepticism about the war. Despite the backlash, Steele's comments resonate with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan deployment. However, his position as RNC chairman demands a different standard, and his remarks were seen as a betrayal of the party's official support for the war effort.
END OF SUMMARY.
