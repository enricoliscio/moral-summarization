Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Michael Steele's comments on the Afghanistan war and the reactions from conservatives.

The user wants a summary that includes specific morally charged words: saying, prosecuted, supported, puts, comment, comments, engage, failed. I need to make sure these words are included.

I'll start by identifying the main points: Steele's statement, the reactions from Kristol and Senor, the inconsistency in Steele's comments, and the political implications. 

Next, I'll structure the summary to include the key events and the moral implications. I'll mention the negative reactions, Kristol's call for resignation, Senor's criticism, and the inconsistency in Steele's statements. I'll also note how his comments align with some anti-war Democrats but not with the Republican stance.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll ensure that each of the moral words is used appropriately in context. For example, "prosecuted" when talking about the war under Bush and Obama, "supported" for the Republican backing, and "failed" regarding historical attempts in Afghanistan.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Steele's statement, the reactions, the inconsistency, and the political fallout. I'll end with the implication that his tenure is shaky, tying back to the moral framing of his comments affecting the party's honor.

SUMMARY:  
Michael Steele, RNC chairman, faced swift criticism from prominent conservatives after saying Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war "of Obama’s choosing." Bill Kristol harshly condemned Steele, calling his comments an "affront" to the Republican Party and soldiers, and demanded his resignation. Kristol emphasized that the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, with Republicans consistently supporting it. Dan Senor, another neoconservative, labeled Steele’s comments "utterly irresponsible," noting the RNC had previously supported Obama’s Afghan surge. Steele’s recent statements conflicted with his own earlier declaration that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." His comments resonated with anti-war Democrats but contrasted with the Republican Party’s stance. Steele’s tenure as RNC chairman appears increasingly precarious amid the backlash. END OF SUMMARY.
