Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making comments about the Afghanistan war. He said it's unwinnable and Obama's choice, which upset conservatives. Bill Kristol called for his resignation, saying the war wasn't Obama's choice and that Republicans supported it. Others like Dan Senor also criticized Steele, pointing out his inconsistent statements. Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats but not with the Republican base. His tenure seems shaky now.

For the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me go through the article again and pick out words that carry moral judgment. Words like "negative," "embarrassment," "affront," "irresponsible," "inconsistent," "skepticism," "critical," "troubles," "shaky." These words convey judgment or evaluation.

Now, for the summary. I need to include these moral words and keep it under 200 words. I'll start by stating that Michael Steele faced backlash for his comments. Mention the conservatives' reactions, Kristol's harsh letter, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, the criticism from Senor, and how it affected his position. Also, note that his comments aligned with some Democrats but not Republicans, leading to questions about his leadership.

Let me put it all together, making sure to include the moral words and keep the summary concise.

Neoconservative Dan Senor labeled Steele's remarks "irresponsible," highlighting Steele's inconsistent stance, as he had previously supported the war.
