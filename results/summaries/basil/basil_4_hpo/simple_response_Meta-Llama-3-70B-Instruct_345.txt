SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, stating that Steele's comment was an "affront" to the honor of the Republican party and the commitment of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol argued that Steele's statement was inconsistent with the party's stance, as Republicans have consistently supported the war effort. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, also criticized Steele's comment as "utterly irresponsible" and pointed out that Steele's RNC had previously sponsored a conference call praising Obama's Afghan surge. Steele's comment has resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky.

END OF SUMMARY.
