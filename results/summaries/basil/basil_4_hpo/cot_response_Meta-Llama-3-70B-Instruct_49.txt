SUMMARY:
RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced swift and negative reactions from prominent conservatives after he stated that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the honor of the Republican party and the commitment of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol argued that Steele's statement was "utterly irresponsible" and "embarrassing" to the party. Other conservatives, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's comment as "inconsistent" with his previous statements supporting the war effort. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but the damage was done. Steele's tenure as RNC chairman now seems "shaky". END OF SUMMARY.
