Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making some comments about the war in Afghanistan, and the reactions from conservatives.

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. Steele was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. This caused a lot of negative reactions from prominent conservatives. Bill Kristol was especially harsh, calling for Steele's resignation. He pointed out that the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, and that Republicans have consistently supported it. Kristol felt that Steele's comments were an affront to the party and the soldiers.

Steele's spokesman tried to clarify that Steele meant Obama hasn't had a winning strategy, but Kristol and others weren't buying it. Dan Senor also criticized Steele, noting that the RNC had previously supported Obama's surge in Afghanistan. Steele had even said before that it's a war we have to win, which makes his recent comments inconsistent.

Interestingly, Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives who are critical of the deployment, but since he's the RNC chairman, it's a bigger issue. His tenure seems shaky now.

Now, the author used specific morally framed words: war, prosecuted, pushing, rally, affront, fighting, irresponsible, escalate, engage, failed, inconsistent. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: Steele's comment, the reactions from Kristol and Senor, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, and the impact on his position. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the severity of the situation.

Let me try to put this together concisely, making sure not to exceed 200 words and including the necessary moral framing words.
