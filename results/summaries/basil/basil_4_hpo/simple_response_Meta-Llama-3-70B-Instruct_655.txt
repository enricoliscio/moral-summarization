SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol argued that Steele's statement is inconsistent with the party's stance, as Republicans have consistently supported the war effort. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, also deemed Steele's comment "utterly irresponsible" and pointed out that Steele's RNC had previously sponsored a conference call to praise Obama's Afghan surge. Steele's recent statement has resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky. 

END OF SUMMARY.
