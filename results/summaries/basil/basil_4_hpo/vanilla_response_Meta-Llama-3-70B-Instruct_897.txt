SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, saying his comment was an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservatives, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's remarks as "utterly irresponsible." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, saying Steele meant that Obama has not provided a winning strategy. However, Steele's previous statements, including one where he declared Afghanistan is "a war we have to win," contradict his latest comment. The controversy has put Steele's tenure as RNC chairman in jeopardy, with some GOP operatives hoping to spread the meme of his troubles.
