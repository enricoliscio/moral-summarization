Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, facing backlash after making comments about the Afghanistan war. 

So, Steele said that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. Conservatives, including Bill Kristol, are reacting negatively. Kristol wrote a letter calling for Steele's resignation because he says the war wasn't Obama's choice; it's been ongoing under Bush and Obama. He also mentions that Steele's comments are embarrassing and an affront to the party and soldiers.

Steele's spokesman tried to clarify that Steele meant Obama hasn't provided a winning strategy, not that the war was Obama's choice. But others like Dan Senor, a neoconservative, also criticized Steele, calling his comments irresponsible. Senor pointed out that Steele had previously supported the war, so this is inconsistent.

Interestingly, Steele's comments are aligning him with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives who are critical of the war, but he's not part of that group. His tenure as RNC chairman is now in question, and Kristol's call for resignation is gaining traction.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event: Steele's comments caused backlash. Then mention the key reactions, including Kristol's letter and Senor's criticism. Also, note the inconsistency with Steele's past statements and the irony of his alignment with anti-war groups. Finally, mention the impact on his position.

I should make sure the summary is concise and covers all these points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step to ensure clarity and brevity.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced sharp criticism after stating that the war in Afghanistan is largely unwinnable and "Obama’s choosing." Conservative figures, including Bill Kristol, condemned Steele, with Kristol calling for his resignation. Kristol argued the war has been ongoing under both Bush and Obama, and Steele’s remarks were inconsistent with Republican support for the conflict. Steele’s spokesman claimed he meant Obama lacked a clear strategy, but critics like Dan Senor accused him of irresponsibility, noting Steele had previously supported the war. Steele’s comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, though he remains a party figurehead. His tenure is now under scrutiny as criticism mounts. END OF SUMMARY.
