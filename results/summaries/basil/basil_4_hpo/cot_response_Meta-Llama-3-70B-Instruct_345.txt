SUMMARY:
RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced swift and negative reactions from prominent conservatives after saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the honor of the Republican Party and the commitment of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Dan Senor, a major neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible." Steele's statement was seen as "inconsistent" with his previous declaration that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." The backlash against Steele's remarks has put his tenure as RNC chairman in a "shaky" position. Ironically, Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his words were deemed an "embarrassment." END OF SUMMARY.
