SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives have criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, for his recent comments about the war in Afghanistan, calling it a war of President Obama's choosing and questioning its winnability. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, called for Steele's resignation, stating that his comments are an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers prosecuting the war. Other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, echoed this sentiment, calling Steele's comments "irresponsible." They highlighted the inconsistency between Steele's previous statements supporting the war and his recent remarks. The irony is that Steele's comments resonate with anti-war Democrats and some conservative pundits who share his skepticism about the war. However, as the figurehead of the Republican Party, Steele's comments are seen as a betrayal of the party's stance and an insult to those fighting in Afghanistan.
END OF SUMMARY.
