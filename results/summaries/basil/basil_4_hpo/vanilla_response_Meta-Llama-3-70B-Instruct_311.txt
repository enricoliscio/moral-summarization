SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and implying it's unwinnable. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, called for Steele's resignation, citing that the war has been prosecuted by both Presidents Bush and Obama, and Republicans have consistently supported the effort. Kristol's letter stated that Steele's comment was an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservatives, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's remarks as "utterly irresponsible" and inconsistent with his previous statements. Ironically, Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky. Kristol's call for resignation was quickly circulated among reporters, potentially further jeopardizing Steele's position.

END OF SUMMARY.
