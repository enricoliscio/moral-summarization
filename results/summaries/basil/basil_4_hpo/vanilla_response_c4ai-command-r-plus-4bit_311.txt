SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, criticized RNC chairman Michael Steele after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a war of President Obama's choosing. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor described Steele's comments as "irresponsible" and inconsistent with the RNC's previous support for the war effort. Steele's spokesman tried to clarify the comments, but the damage was done, and some even called for Steele's resignation. The irony is that Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan war, but as RNC chairman, he is expected to represent the Republican Party's official stance on the issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
