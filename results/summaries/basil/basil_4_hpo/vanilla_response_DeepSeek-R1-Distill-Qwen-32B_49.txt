Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Steele's comments on the Afghanistan war and the reactions from conservatives. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

First, Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, said that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. That's the main point. Then, several conservatives reacted negatively. Bill Kristol wrote a harsh letter calling for Steele's resignation because he said the war wasn't Obama's choiceâ€”it started under Bush and Republicans supported it. Kristol felt it was an embarrassment and an affront to the party and the soldiers.

Steele's spokesman tried to clarify that Steele meant Obama hasn't had a clear strategy, not that the war was his choice. But Kristol wasn't the only one; Dan Senor, a neoconservative, also criticized Steele as "utterly irresponsible." Senor pointed out that Steele's RNC had supported Obama's surge in Afghanistan before, and Steele himself had previously said the war must be won. So his recent comments were inconsistent.

Ironically, Steele's comments aligned with some anti-war Democrats and conservative critics like Joe Scarborough and George Will, but Steele isn't part of that group. He's a Republican leader, so this is a big issue. Kristol's call for resignation was picked up by GOP operatives to spread the story, making Steele's position shaky.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Steele's comment and the negative reactions. Then mention Kristol's letter, the clarification, other reactions, the inconsistency, and the irony with Democrats and conservatives. Finally, note the impact on Steele's position.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Steele's comment on Afghanistan as unwinnable, Obama's choice.
2. Negative reactions from conservatives, especially Kristol's resignation call.
3. Clarification from Steele's spokesman.
4. Other criticisms from Senor and the inconsistency in Steele's statements.
5. Resonance with anti-war groups and conservatives.
6. Steele's position as RNC chairman and the spread of the story.

I should make sure each point is concise and flows logically. Also, keep the language clear and straightforward without any markdown. The summary should end with the specified tokens.
