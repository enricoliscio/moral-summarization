SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives offered swift and negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele’s resignation in a letter published on his Weekly Standard site. Kristol argued that Steele’s comment was “an affront” to the honor of the Republican Party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservative figures, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele’s comments as “utterly irresponsible.” They noted that Steele’s previous statements and actions, including a conference call sponsored by the RNC to praise Obama’s Afghan surge, were inconsistent with his latest remarks. Steele’s comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the U.S. deployment in Afghanistan. However, as the figurehead of the Republican Party, Steele’s tenure once again seems shaky as critics call for his resignation.
END OF SUMMARY.
