SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives were quick to criticize Michael Steele on Friday after the RNC chairman made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a choice made by President Obama. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation in a letter published on his Weekly Standard site. Kristol argued that the war in Afghanistan has been prosecuted under both Presidents Bush and Obama and that Republicans have consistently supported the effort. He criticized Steele's comments as an embarrassment and an affront to the honor of the Republican Party and the commitment of the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, also condemned Steele's comments as irresponsible and inconsistent with the RNC's previous support for the war effort. Steele's tenure as RNC chairman has been marked by controversy, and his recent comments have once again raised questions about his leadership.
END OF SUMMARY.
