Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a specific structure with two steps: first identifying morally framed words, then writing a summary. 

Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "swift," "negative," "embarrassment," "affront," "irresponsible," "inconsistent," "skepticism," "shaky," and "troubles" stand out. These words convey judgment or evaluation, which is the moral framing.

Next, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it concise. I should mention the key points: Steele's comment, the reactions from Kristol and Senor, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, the support from Republicans, and the impact on his position.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the criticism, the inconsistency, and the resulting issues for Steele. Making sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the original tone and framing.

**STEP 1:**  
* Swift  
* Negative  
* Embarrassment  
* Affront  
* Irresponsible  
* Inconsistent  
* Skepticism  
* Shaky  
* Troubles  

**SUMMARY:**  
Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, faced swift negative reactions from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential Republican voice, called for Steele’s resignation, labeling his comments an affront to the Republican Party and the soldiers in Afghanistan. Kristol emphasized that the war was supported by Republicans under both Bush and Obama, and Steele’s statement put him at odds with the party. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, described Steele’s remarks as utterly irresponsible, noting that Steele had previously praised Obama’s Afghan surge. Steele’s latest comments also resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, though Steele is not an anti-war figure but the Republican Party’s leader. His inconsistent statements have raised questions about his leadership, with Kristol’s call for resignation spreading quickly among GOP operatives. END OF SUMMARY.
