SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives have criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, for his recent comments about the war in Afghanistan, calling it a war of Obama's choosing and questioning its winnability. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, led the charge by calling for Steele's resignation, stating that his comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers prosecuting the war. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, called Steele's comments "irresponsible," highlighting their inconsistency with the RNC's previous support for the war and its escalation. Steele's remarks have also been seen as an affront to the honor of the Republican Party and the commitment of the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. While Steele's comments have found resonance among anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the war, they have caused a backlash within the Republican Party, with some calling for his resignation. The incident once again raises questions about Steele's tenure as the figurehead of the Republican Party. END OF SUMMARY.
