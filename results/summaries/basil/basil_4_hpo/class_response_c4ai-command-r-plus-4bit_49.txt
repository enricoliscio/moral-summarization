SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives have criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, for his recent comments about the war in Afghanistan, calling it an "affront" and "irresponsible." Steele was caught on camera saying that the war is largely unwinnable and that it was a war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, called for Steele's resignation, stating that his comments were an "affront to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish their mission." Kristol also highlighted the inconsistency of Steele's comments, noting that Steele himself had previously declared that Afghanistan was "a war we have to win." Other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, echoed Kristol's sentiments, calling Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible." Steele's spokesman tried to clarify the comments, but the damage was done, and once again, Steele's tenure as RNC chairman appears shaky.
END OF SUMMARY.
