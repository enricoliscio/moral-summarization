SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, offered swift and negative reactions to Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele's comments that the war in Afghanistan is largely unwinnable. Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor, a neoconservative figure and booster of U.S. military escalation in Afghanistan, called Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible." Steele's spokesman tried to clarify the comments, but they still caused a backlash, with some calling for his resignation. The irony is that Steele's comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative pundits who share skepticism about the war, even though Steele himself is not an anti-war figure. Once again, Steele's tenure as RNC chairman seems shaky.
END OF SUMMARY.
