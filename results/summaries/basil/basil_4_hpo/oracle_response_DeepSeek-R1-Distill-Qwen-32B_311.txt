Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context. It's about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making comments about the Afghanistan war, which conservatives are reacting to negatively.

The author uses words like "saying," "prosecuted," "supported," "puts," "comment," "comments," "engage," and "failed." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I'll start by identifying the main points: Steele's comments, the reactions from Kristol and Senor, the inconsistency in Steele's statements, and the political implications. 

I should structure the summary to include the key moral points, like how his comments were seen as an affront and inconsistent. Also, note that anti-war Democrats agreed with him, which is an interesting twist. 

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all the important elements are covered. I'll make sure to use the specified morally framed words where appropriate.

Let me draft a summary that flows well, includes all necessary points, and preserves the moral framing. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Several prominent conservatives swiftly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele after he stated that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war "of President Obama’s choosing." Bill Kristol, a influential Republican voice, called for Steele’s resignation, criticizing his comments as an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers serving in Afghanistan. Kristol emphasized that the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, with Republicans consistently supporting it. Steele’s spokesman attempted to clarify, stating that Steele meant Obama lacked a clear winning strategy, but the damage was done. Neoconservative Dan Senor also criticized Steele’s comments as "utterly irresponsible," noting that the RNC had previously supported Obama’s Afghan surge. Steele’s recent remarks contradicted his earlier assertion that Afghanistan was "a war we have to win." His comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, but as the Republican figurehead, his stance was seen as inconsistent and politically damaging. Kristol’s call for resignation sparked a media frenzy, further shaking Steele’s already precarious tenure. END OF SUMMARY.
