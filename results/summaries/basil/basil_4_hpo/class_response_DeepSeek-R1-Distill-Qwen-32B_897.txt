Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I need to ensure the summary captures the ethical and evaluative language used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made controversial comments about the Afghanistan war, leading to criticism from prominent conservatives. Bill Kristol was particularly harsh, calling for his resignation, and others like Dan Senor also criticized him. Steele's statements were inconsistent with his past support and resonated with anti-war Democrats.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article: war, prosecuted, pushing, rally, affront, fighting, irresponsible, escalate, engage, failed, inconsistent. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by stating that Steele's comments sparked criticism, using "prosecuted" and "pushing" to describe the context. Then, I'll mention Kristol's harsh reaction, using "affront" and "irresponsible." I'll note Senor's criticism about inconsistency and the irony that Steele's comments aligned with anti-war groups. Finally, I'll conclude with the impact on his tenure, using "failed" and "inconsistent."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including all the key points and moral terms. Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence contributes to the overall summary without redundancy.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, faced sharp criticism from prominent conservatives after stating that the war in Afghanistan is largely unwinnable and "a war of Obama’s choosing." Bill Kristol, a influential Republican voice, called for Steele’s resignation, labeling his comments an "affront" to the party and the soldiers fighting the war. Kristol emphasized that the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, with Republicans consistently supporting it. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, deemed Steele’s remarks "utterly irresponsible," noting they contradicted his previous support for the Afghan surge. Steele’s spokesman attempted to clarify his comments, stating Steele meant Obama lacked a winning strategy, but critics argued his statements were inconsistent with his past declarations. Steele’s comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but as the Republican Party’s figurehead, his stance was seen as a betrayal of the party’s commitment to the war. His tenure now appears increasingly shaky, with GOP operatives seeking to amplify the criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
