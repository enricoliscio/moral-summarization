Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific instructions to use the morally framed words they've listed. Let me read through the article again to understand the context.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making controversial comments about the Afghanistan war. He said it's a largely unwinnable war chosen by Obama. Conservatives, including Bill Kristol, are criticizing him, calling for his resignation. They argue that the war wasn't Obama's choice but has been ongoing under Bush and Obama. Kristol's letter is harsh, saying Steele's comments are an affront to the party and the soldiers. Others like Dan Senor also criticized Steele, pointing out his past support for the surge. Meanwhile, anti-war Democrats and some conservatives agree with Steele, but he's not part of that group. His tenure is now in question.

Now, I need to make a summary using the words: saying, prosecuted, supported, puts, comment, comments, engage, failed. I should keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step.

First, mention Steele's comments and the negative reactions. Then, Kristol's harsh response, emphasizing the prosecution of the war by both Bush and Obama. Highlight that Republicans supported it. Then, Steele's comment puts him at odds with the party. Mention his previous statements supporting the war, making his recent comments inconsistent. Note that his comments resonate with anti-war groups but he's a Republican leader. Conclude with his shaky tenure.

I should ensure all the moral words are included naturally. Let me draft it, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, RNC chairman, faced sharp criticism after saying Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war "of Obama’s choosing." Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol, condemned his comments, arguing the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, and Republicans have consistently supported it. Kristol called Steele’s comment an affront to the party and soldiers, urging his resignation. Dan Senor, another neoconservative, labeled Steele’s comments "utterly irresponsible," noting the RNC had previously supported Obama’s Afghan surge. Steele’s recent statements contradict his past declarations that Afghanistan is a war "we have to win." His comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but as the Republican figurehead, his remarks are seen as inconsistent and damaging. His tenure now appears shaky amid growing calls for his departure. END OF SUMMARY.
