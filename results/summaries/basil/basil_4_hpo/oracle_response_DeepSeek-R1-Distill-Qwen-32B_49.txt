Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible, which are: saying, prosecuted, supported, puts, comment, comments, engage, failed.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Steele, RNC chairman, made a statement about Afghanistan being unwinnable and Obama's choice. This caused negative reactions from prominent conservatives like Bill Kristol and Dan Senor. They criticized his comments as inconsistent and embarrassing, especially since Republicans have supported the war under both Bush and Obama. Steele's own past statements support the war, adding to the inconsistency. His comments also resonated with anti-war Democrats, but he's a Republican leader, so it's problematic.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary, using the specified moral words. I should mention Steele's "saying" and the fact that the war was "prosecuted" by previous presidents. Kristol's letter "puts" Steele at odds with the party. Steele's "comment" is seen as an "affront" and "irresponsible." His past "supported" the war, making his recent "comments" inconsistent. The article also notes that "failed" attempts by others over a thousand years, and "engage" in a land war, which Steele now advises against. His remarks "resonated" with anti-war groups, highlighting the moral conflict within the party.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words, captures all key points, and uses the moral terms effectively. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
Michael Steele, RNC chairman, faced sharp criticism after saying Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol, condemned his comments, calling them an affront to the Republican Party and the soldiers in Afghanistan. Kristol argued the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, with Republicans consistently supporting it. Steele’s spokesman tried to clarify, stating Steele meant Obama lacked a winning strategy, but Kristol and others, like Dan Senor, deemed the comments utterly irresponsible. Senor noted Steele had previously supported the war, calling his recent statements inconsistent. Steele’s remarks resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but as the Republican Party’s figurehead, his comments were seen as failing to align with the party’s stance. His tenure now appears shaky, with GOP operatives seeking to amplify the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
