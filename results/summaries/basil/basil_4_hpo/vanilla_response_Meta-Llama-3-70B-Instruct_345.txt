SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, stating that Steele's comment was an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservatives, including Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's comment as "utterly irresponsible." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, saying that Steele meant Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy. However, Steele's previous statements have been inconsistent, with him previously declaring that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." Steele's comment has resonated with anti-war Democrats, but his tenure as RNC Chairman appears shaky.

END OF SUMMARY.
