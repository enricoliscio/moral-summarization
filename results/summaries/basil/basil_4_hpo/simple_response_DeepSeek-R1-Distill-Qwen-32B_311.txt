Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. So, I should focus on the key points and the underlying moral implications.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made a statement about Afghanistan being unwinnable and Obama's choice. Conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, reacted negatively, calling his comments irresponsible and inconsistent with Republican support for the war.

I need to highlight the moral framing here. The conservatives are emphasizing loyalty to the party and support for the troops. Steele's comments are seen as disloyal and embarrassing, which goes against the expected unity and support within the Republican Party.

Also, the article mentions that Steele's remarks resonate with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, showing a division within the party. This internal conflict is a moral issue because it reflects a lack of solidarity and undermines the party's stance on the war.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the reactions and the moral implications. I'll structure it to first state Steele's comments, then the conservative backlash, the inconsistency in his statements, and the broader implications for the party's unity and support for the troops.

SUMMARY:  
Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced sharp criticism from conservatives after stating that the war in Afghanistan was "largely unwinnable" and "Obama’s choosing." Prominent figures like Bill Kristol and Dan Senor condemned Steele’s remarks as inconsistent with Republican support for the war and embarrassing to the party. Kristol called for Steele’s resignation, arguing that the chairman’s comments dishonored the party and the troops. Steele’s spokesman attempted to clarify that the remark was about Obama’s lack of a clear strategy, but the damage was done. Steele’s comments also drew parallels with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, though he is not aligned with their views. The incident highlights the tension between party unity and dissent, with Steele’s tenure as RNC chairman appearing increasingly fragile. END OF SUMMARY.
