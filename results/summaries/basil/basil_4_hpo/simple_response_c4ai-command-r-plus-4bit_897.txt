SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, have criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, for his recent comments about the war in Afghanistan. Steele stated that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing, which has been met with backlash as it contradicts the Republican Party's longstanding support for the war effort. Kristol, in a letter calling for Steele's resignation, emphasized that the war has been prosecuted under both Presidents Bush and Obama and that Republicans have consistently supported it. He also highlighted the importance of standing behind the mission and the soldiers fighting to accomplish it. Senor, a neoconservative figure and booster of U.S. military escalation in Afghanistan, also condemned Steele's comments as irresponsible and inconsistent with the RNC's previous statements. Steele's remarks have, however, found resonance among anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan deployment. Despite the backlash, Steele's tenure as RNC chairman remains uncertain.
END OF SUMMARY.
