SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservatives, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's statement as "utterly irresponsible" and inconsistent with his previous support for the war effort. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but the damage was done. Ironically, Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky. Kristol's call for resignation was quickly amplified by GOP operatives, further eroding Steele's credibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
