SUMMARY: Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, strongly criticized RNC Chairman Michael Steele after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a war of President Obama's choosing. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an embarrassment and an affront to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor described Steele's comments as "utterly irresponsible," noting that they contradicted the RNC's previous support for the war effort. Steele's spokesman tried to clarify his comments, but the damage was done, and his tenure as RNC chairman once again appeared shaky. The irony of the situation was noted, as Steele's comments found resonance among anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan war, even as they drew fire from within his own party.
END OF SUMMARY.
