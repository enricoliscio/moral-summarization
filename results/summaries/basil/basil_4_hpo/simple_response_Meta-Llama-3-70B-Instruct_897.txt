SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, faced severe backlash from prominent conservatives after he stated that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment as an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol argued that Steele's statement was inconsistent with the party's stance, which has consistently supported the war effort. Other conservatives, such as Dan Senor, also condemned Steele's remarks as "utterly irresponsible." The criticism is particularly noteworthy given Steele's previous statements, including one in which he declared that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." The incident has raised questions about Steele's leadership and tenure as RNC chairman.
