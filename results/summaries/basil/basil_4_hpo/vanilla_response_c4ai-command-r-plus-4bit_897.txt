SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, strongly criticized Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a war of President Obama's choosing. In a letter published on his website, Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an embarrassment and an affront to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor, a neoconservative figure and booster of U.S. military escalation in Afghanistan, also criticized Steele's comments as irresponsible and inconsistent with the RNC's previous support for the war effort. While Steele's spokesman tried to clarify his remarks, the damage was done, and his tenure as RNC chairman once again appears shaky. The episode highlights the divide within the Republican Party on the issue of the war in Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
