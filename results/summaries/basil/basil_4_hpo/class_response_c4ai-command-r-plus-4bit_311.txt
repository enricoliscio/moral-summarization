SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives have criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, for his recent comments about the war in Afghanistan, calling it a war of President Obama's choosing and questioning its winnability. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, went so far as to call for Steele's resignation, stating that his comments are an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers prosecuting the war. Other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, have also denounced Steele's remarks as "irresponsible." The irony is that Steele's comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative pundits who share his skepticism about the war. However, as the figurehead of the Republican Party, Steele's stance is inconsistent with the party's traditional support for the war effort. The backlash against Steele's comments highlights the ongoing debate within the Republican Party about the war in Afghanistan and the role of the US in it. END OF SUMMARY.
