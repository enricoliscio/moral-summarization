SUMMARY:
RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced severe backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party's "honor" and the "commitment" of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol argued that Steele's statement was "utterly irresponsible" and "embarrassing" to the party. Other conservatives, including Dan Senor, also condemned Steele's remarks, citing their inconsistency with the party's previous stance on the war. Ironically, Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky. Kristol's call for resignation has sparked a meme of Steele's troubles, which is spreading rapidly among GOP operatives.
END OF SUMMARY.
