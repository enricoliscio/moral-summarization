SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including influential neoconservative voices, sharply criticized Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele on Friday after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a mistake by President Obama. Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Dan Senor, a former Bush administration official and advocate for a stronger U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, also criticized Steele's remarks as "irresponsible" and inconsistent with the RNC's previous support for the war effort. While Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify his comments, the incident once again raised questions about Steele's tenure as RNC chairman, with some suggesting that his position may be in jeopardy. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate within the Republican Party over the war in Afghanistan and the appropriate role of the U.S. in foreign conflicts. END OF SUMMARY.
