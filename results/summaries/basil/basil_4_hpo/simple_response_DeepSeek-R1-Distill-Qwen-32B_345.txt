Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is about Michael Steele's comments on the Afghanistan war and the reactions from conservatives. 

First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the key points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, said that Afghanistan is an unwinnable war chosen by Obama. This caused a stir among conservatives. Bill Kristol was especially harsh, calling for his resignation, saying the war wasn't Obama's choice but supported by Republicans. Others like Dan Senor also criticized Steele, pointing out his inconsistent statements. Steele's spokesman tried to clarify, saying he meant Obama didn't have a clear strategy. 

Interestingly, some anti-war Democrats agreed with Steele, but he's a Republican leader, so his stance is seen as a betrayal. His tenure is now shaky, and Kristol's move might be a strategic push for his removal.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." and starting with "SUMMARY:". I need to make sure I include all the main points: Steele's comments, the reactions, the inconsistency in his statements, and the implications for his position. 

I should also maintain the moral framing, which in this case is the criticism from conservatives about loyalty and responsibility towards the party and the troops. It's important to highlight the conflict and the potential consequences for Steele's leadership.

Let me structure the summary: start with Steele's statement, then the reactions from Kristol and Senor, mention the inconsistency, note the irony with anti-war Democrats, and conclude with the impact on his position. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Time to put it all together clearly and succinctly.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced harsh criticism after stating that the war in Afghanistan was "largely unwinnable" and "Obama’s choosing." Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol of *The Weekly Standard*, condemned Steele, with Kristol calling for his resignation. Kristol argued that the war was supported by Republicans under both Bush and Obama, and Steele’s comments were inconsistent with party unity and dishonored soldiers. Dan Senor, another conservative figure, labeled Steele’s remarks "utterly irresponsible," noting that Steele had previously praised the Afghan surge. Steele’s spokesman attempted to clarify that he meant Obama lacked a winning strategy, but critics pointed out Steele’s inconsistency, as he had previously declared Afghanistan a "war we have to win." While Steele’s comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, his position as RNC chairman made his stance particularly problematic. His tenure now appears uncertain, with Kristol’s call for resignation gaining traction. END OF SUMMARY.
