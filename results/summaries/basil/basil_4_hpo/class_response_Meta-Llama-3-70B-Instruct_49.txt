SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders have condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's statement that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and a "largely unwinnable war". Bill Kristol, a prominent conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers "fighting" to accomplish their mission. Kristol argued that Steele's statement is "inconsistent" with the party's stance, as Republicans have consistently supported the war effort. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's comment "utterly irresponsible". Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the statement, but Kristol and Senor were unswayed. The backlash against Steele has put his tenure as RNC chairman in jeopardy. Ironically, Steele's comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his words are seen as a betrayal of the party's values. END OF SUMMARY.
