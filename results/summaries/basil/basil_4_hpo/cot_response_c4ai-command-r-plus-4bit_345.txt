SUMMARY:
Several prominent conservatives had a *negative* reaction to comments made by Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, in which he stated that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and of President Obama's choosing. The *pushback* was led by Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, who called for Steele's resignation in an open letter. Kristol and other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, characterized Steele's comments as "*utterly irresponsible*" and an "*affront* to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan." They pointed out that Steele's recent comments contradicted his previous statements and the official position of the Republican Party, which has consistently supported the war effort. The incident has once again raised questions about Steele's tenure as RNC chairman, with some suggesting that his position may be *shaky*. Conservative operatives were quick to spread the word of Steele's *troubles*, hoping to capitalize on the controversy.
END OF SUMMARY.
