Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that need to be preserved. I need to make sure I include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made a statement saying Afghanistan is an unwinnable war chosen by Obama. This caused a lot of backlash from conservatives, including Bill Kristol, who called for his resignation. Other conservatives like Dan Senor also criticized Steele, pointing out his past support for the war. Meanwhile, anti-war Democrats agreed with Steele, but he's a Republican leader, so it's a big deal.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: war, prosecuted, pushing, rally, affront, fighting, irresponsible, escalate, engage, failed, inconsistent. I should use these words in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning Steele's statement about the war, then the reactions from Kristol and others. I'll note that Kristol called it an affront and that Senor said it was irresponsible. I'll mention how Steele's comments were inconsistent with his past support. Also, include the part about anti-war Democrats agreeing, but Steele's position as a Republican leader makes it significant.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to flow from Steele's statement, the criticism, the inconsistency, and the implications for his position.

Let me draft it:

Michael Steele, RNC chairman, faced backlash for calling Afghanistan a war Obama chose, deemed unwinnable. Critics like Bill Kristol called it an affront, urging resignation. Steele's spokesman clarified it was about Obama's strategy, but Kristol and Dan Senor labeled it irresponsible, highlighting Steele's past support. His recent comments contrasted with his previous stance, resonating with anti-war Democrats but conflicting as a Republican leader. His tenure seems shaky.

Wait, I need to include more of the morally framed words. Maybe add "prosecuted" when talking about the war under Bush and Obama. Also, mention "pushing" for funding and "rallying" support. Also, "failed" in history and "escalate" from Senor's background.

Let me adjust:

Michael Steele, RNC chairman, sparked outrage by calling Afghanistan a war Obama chose, deemed unwinnable. Critics like Bill Kristol called it an affront, urging resignation. The war was prosecuted under Bush and Obama, with Republicans supporting it. Steele's comment was inconsistent with his past support and Senor's push for escalation. His remarks resonated with anti-war Democrats but as a Republican leader, it's a significant issue. His tenure seems shaky.

Hmm, that's better. I included prosecuted, affront, push, escalate, inconsistent. Maybe add "fighting" and "failed" somewhere.

Final version:

Michael Steele, RNC chairman, sparked outrage by calling Afghanistan a war Obama chose, deemed unwinnable. Critics like Bill Kristol called it an affront, urging resignation. The war was prosecuted under Bush and Obama, with Republicans pushing for funding and rallying support. Steele's comment was inconsistent with his past support and Senor's push for escalation. His remarks, echoing anti-war Democrats, failed to align with his role, making his tenure shaky.

That should cover most of the moral words and the key points concisely.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced significant backlash after stating that the war in Afghanistan was "largely unwinnable" and "a war of Obama’s choosing." Critics, including influential conservative voices like Bill Kristol, condemned Steele’s remarks, calling them an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting the war. Kristol urged Steele’s resignation, emphasizing that the war had been prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, with Republicans consistently supporting it. Steele’s spokesman attempted to clarify his comments, stating that Steele was referring to Obama’s lack of a winning strategy. However, other conservatives, like Dan Senor, labeled Steele’s remarks "irresponsible," noting his past support for the war and its escalation. Steele’s recent comments were inconsistent with his earlier statements, such as declaring Afghanistan a "war we have to win." While Steele’s views resonated with anti-war Democrats, his position as a Republican leader made the controversy particularly significant, shaking his tenure. END OF SUMMARY.
