Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should use the morally framed words provided: saying, prosecuted, supported, puts, comment, comments, engage, failed.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made a statement about Afghanistan being unwinnable, which was Obama's choice. Conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, criticized him harshly. Kristol called for his resignation, pointing out that Republicans have supported the war under both Bush and Obama. Steele tried to clarify his statement, but the damage was done. His comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but as the RNC chairman, this was seen as inconsistent and damaging.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary using the specified words. I'll start by mentioning Steele's statement, using "saying." Then, note the conservative reactions, using "prosecuted" and "supported." Kristol's letter should include "puts" and "comment." Highlight the inconsistency in Steele's statements using "comments" and "failed." Also, mention the resonance with anti-war groups, using "engage" and "failed."

I should ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, keeping the moral tone intact. I'll structure it to show the criticism, the context of Republican support, the clarification attempt, and the broader implications of his comments.

Let me piece it together, making sure each morally framed word is appropriately included without forcing them in. The summary should clearly reflect the conflict and the fallout from Steele's remarks.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, RNC chairman, faced criticism after saying Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war "of Obama’s choosing." Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol, condemned his comments, with Kristol calling for Steele’s resignation. Kristol argued the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, and Republicans have consistently supported it. Steele’s statement, Kristol wrote, puts him at odds with the party and dishonors soldiers. Others, like Dan Senor, called the comments "utterly irresponsible," noting Steele had previously supported the war. Steele’s spokesman tried to clarify, insisting he meant Obama lacked a winning strategy. However, Steele’s recent comments failed to align with his past statements, including declaring Afghanistan a war "we have to win." His remarks resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservatives, but as RNC chairman, his stance was seen as inconsistent and damaging to the party. END OF SUMMARY.
