SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders have strongly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's comments that the war in Afghanistan is "a war of Obama's choosing" and "unwinnable". Bill Kristol, a prominent voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, saying his comment is "an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission". Kristol emphasized that Republicans have consistently supported the war effort, and Steele's statement puts him at odds with the party. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, labeled Steele's comments as "utterly irresponsible". Steele's own past statements, including his declaration that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win", contradict his recent comments. The backlash against Steele's remarks has raised questions about his fitness to lead the Republican Party. END OF SUMMARY.
