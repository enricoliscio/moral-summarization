SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders swiftly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's statement that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, saying his comment "puts [him] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party" and is "an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission." Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, labeled Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible" and pointed out the inconsistency with Steele's previous statement that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." The backlash against Steele's comments highlights his failure to support the war effort and engage with the Republican Party's stance on Afghanistan. His words have resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, Steele's tenure is now shaky. END OF SUMMARY.
