SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders have condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's statement that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a prominent conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers "fighting" to accomplish their mission. Kristol argued that Steele's statement is "inconsistent" with the party's stance, as Republicans have consistently supported the war effort. Dan Senor, another major neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible" and noted that the RNC had previously sponsored a conference call to praise Obama's Afghan surge. Steele's statement has sparked outrage among conservatives, who see it as a betrayal of the party's commitment to the war effort. In contrast, Steele's comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats who share his skepticism about the war's winnability. END OF SUMMARY.
