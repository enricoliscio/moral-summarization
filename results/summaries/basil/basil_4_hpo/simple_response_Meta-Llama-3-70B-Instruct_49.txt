SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol argued that Steele's statement contradicts the party's consistent support for the war effort. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, also deemed Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible" and inconsistent with his previous stance that Afghanistan is a "war we have to win." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but the damage was done. The incident has sparked calls for Steele's resignation, with some GOP operatives eager to spread the narrative of Steele's troubles. The episode highlights the importance of responsible leadership and the need for party leaders to stay true to their party's principles.
