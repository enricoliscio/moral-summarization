SUMMARY:
Conservative leaders swiftly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's statement that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling the comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's statement "utterly irresponsible." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but Kristol and Senor argued that it was inconsistent with Steele's previous statements, including his declaration that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." The backlash has put Steele's tenure in a "shaky" position, with some GOP operatives hoping to spread the meme of his troubles. END OF SUMMARY.
