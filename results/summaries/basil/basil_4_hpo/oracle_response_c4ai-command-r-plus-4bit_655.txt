SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, offered swift and negative reactions to Michael Steele, the figurehead of the Republican Party, after he proclaimed that the war in Afghanistan was "a war of Obama's choosing" and unwinnable. Kristol, in a letter calling for Steele's resignation, emphasized that the war has been prosecuted under both Presidents Bush and Obama and that Republicans have consistently supported the effort. He deemed Steele's comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure and booster of U.S. military escalation in Afghanistan, also criticized Steele's remarks as "utterly irresponsible." Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, but the damage was done. Steele's recent statements, contradicting his earlier declaration that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win," have caused a backlash within the Republican Party, with some calling for his resignation.
END OF SUMMARY.
