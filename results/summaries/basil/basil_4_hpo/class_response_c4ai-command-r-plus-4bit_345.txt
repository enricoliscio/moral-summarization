SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives have criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, for his recent comments about the war in Afghanistan, calling it an "unwinnable war of Obamaâ€™s choosing." Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, led the charge by calling for Steele's resignation, stating that his comments are an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers prosecuting the war. Kristol and other neoconservatives, like Dan Senor, criticized Steele for being "irresponsible" and inconsistent with his previous support for the war. Steele's comments have resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the war but have caused backlash within the Republican Party. Steele's tenure as RNC chairman once again appears shaky as some GOP operatives are spreading the word of his troubles.
END OF SUMMARY.
