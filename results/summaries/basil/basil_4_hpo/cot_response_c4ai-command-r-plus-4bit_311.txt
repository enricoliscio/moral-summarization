SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made controversial comments about the war in Afghanistan, stating that it is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. These remarks sparked swift and *negative* reactions from prominent conservatives. The *pushback* was led by Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, who called for Steele's resignation in an open letter. Kristol and other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, criticized Steele for his inconsistency and deemed his comments "irresponsible" and an "*affront* to the honor of the Republican Party." Steele's tenure as RNC chairman once again appears *shaky*, with his comments resonating more with anti-war Democrats than his own party. The GOP quickly circulated Kristol's letter, hoping to spread the narrative of Steele's *troubles*.
END OF SUMMARY.
