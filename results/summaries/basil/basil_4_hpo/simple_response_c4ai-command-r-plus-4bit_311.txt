SUMMARY: Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, strongly criticized Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele for his comments that the war in Afghanistan is largely unwinnable and a war of President Obama's choosing. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor, a neoconservative and booster of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, called Steele's comments "irresponsible" and inconsistent with the RNC's previous support for the war effort. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comments, but the damage was done, and his tenure as RNC chairman once again appears shaky. The irony is that Steele's comments resonate with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan war, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, he faces intense backlash for expressing skepticism about the war's winnability. END OF SUMMARY.
