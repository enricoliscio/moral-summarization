Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making controversial comments about the Afghanistan war. Prominent conservatives like Bill Kristol and Dan Senor reacted negatively. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, saying the war wasn't Obama's choice but supported by Republicans. Senor criticized Steele's inconsistency since he previously supported the surge.

I need to include the moral words: war, prosecuted, pushing, rally, affront, fighting, irresponsible, escalate, engage, failed, inconsistent. I should make sure these terms are present in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to highlight the key points: Steele's comments, the reactions, the inconsistency, and the political implications.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all moral terms are included and the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, faced swift backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential Republican voice, called for Steele’s resignation, emphasizing that the war was prosecuted under both Bush and Obama, and Republicans have consistently supported it. Kristol accused Steele of affronting the party and its soldiers. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, labeled Steele’s comments “utterly irresponsible,” noting that Steele had previously declared Afghanistan a war “we have to win.” Steele’s recent statements contrasted with his past support for Obama’s Afghan surge, making them inconsistent. His remarks resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, though Steele’s role as RNC chairman complicates the issue. His tenure appears increasingly shaky as critics push for his removal. END OF SUMMARY.
