SUMMARY:

Conservative leaders swiftly condemned RNC Chairman Michael Steele's remarks that the war in Afghanistan is "unwinnable" and of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, a prominent Republican voice, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers "fighting" to accomplish their mission. Kristol argued that Steele's statement is "inconsistent" with the party's stance, as Republicans have consistently supported the war effort. Dan Senor, a neoconservative figure, deemed Steele's comments "utterly irresponsible" and contradictory to his previous statement that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." Steele's remarks have resonated with anti-war Democrats, but as the figurehead of the Republican Party, his tenure is now shaky. The pushback against Steele's comments has been intense, with many calling for his resignation.
