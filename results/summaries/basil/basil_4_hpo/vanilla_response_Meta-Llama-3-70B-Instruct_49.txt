SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, labeling his comment an "embarrassment" and "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservatives, including Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's remarks as "utterly irresponsible" and inconsistent with his previous statements supporting the war effort. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify the comment, saying he meant that President Obama lacks a winning strategy. However, Steele's remarks resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the war. The controversy has put Steele's tenure as RNC Chairman in jeopardy, with a GOP operative pitching the story to reporters.
