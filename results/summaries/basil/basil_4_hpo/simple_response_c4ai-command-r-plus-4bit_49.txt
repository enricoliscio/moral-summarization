SUMMARY: Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, harshly criticized Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a mistake by President Obama. Kristol, in a letter calling for Steele's resignation, argued that the war has been prosecuted under both Republican and Democratic presidents and that Republicans have consistently supported it. He characterized Steele's comments as an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Senor, a neoconservative who has supported an escalated U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, also criticized Steele, noting that the RNC had previously sponsored a conference call to praise Obama's surge of troops to the country. Steele's recent comments contradict his earlier statements about the importance of winning the war in Afghanistan, and they have been met with backlash from members of his own party, who view them as irresponsible and inconsistent. Steele's tenure as RNC chairman once again appears precarious as conservatives call for his removal.
END OF SUMMARY.
