SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, faced swift and severe backlash from prominent conservatives after expressing controversial views on the war in Afghanistan. Bill Kristol, an influential Republican voice, demanded Steele's resignation in an open letter, condemning his remarks as an "*embarrassing*" and "*affront*" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Kristol emphasized that Republicans have consistently supported the war effort under both Bush and Obama administrations. Dan Senor, another neoconservative figure, echoed similar sentiments, calling Steele's comments "*irresponsible*." The irony lies in the fact that Steele's previous statements aligned with the Republican stance on Afghanistan, declaring it "*a war we have to win*." However, his recent remarks, suggesting the war is "*unwinnable*" and comparing it to historical failures, have caused an "*shaky*" situation for Steele, with his tenure once again facing "*troubles*" as his comments resonated more with anti-war Democrats than his own party.
END OF SUMMARY.
