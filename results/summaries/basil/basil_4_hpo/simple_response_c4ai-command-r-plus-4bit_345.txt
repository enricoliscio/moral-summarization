SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol and Dan Senor, strongly criticized Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a mistake by President Obama. Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. He also pointed out that Steele's comments contradicted the party's consistent support for the war effort under both Presidents Bush and Obama. Senor, a neoconservative and booster of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, called Steele's comments "irresponsible" and noted their inconsistency with the RNC's previous statements. Steele's remarks, however, found resonance among anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the Afghanistan deployment. Despite the backlash, Steele's spokesman tried to clarify his comments, attributing them to Obama's lack of a winning strategy. This incident once again raises questions about Steele's leadership and his shaky standing within the Republican Party.
END OF SUMMARY.
