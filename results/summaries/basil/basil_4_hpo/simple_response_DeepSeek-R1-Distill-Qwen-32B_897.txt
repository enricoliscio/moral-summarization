Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making comments that the war in Afghanistan is unwinnable and was Obama's choice. Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol, are reacting negatively, calling for his resignation. Kristol points out that the war started under Bush and that Republicans have supported it. Steele's spokesman tried to clarify, saying he meant Obama didn't have a winning strategy, but Kristol wasn't swayed. Others like Dan Senor also criticized Steele, noting his past support for the war. Interestingly, some anti-war Democrats and conservative critics like Joe Scarborough agree with Steele's current stance, but Steele isn't part of that group. His position is shaky because of this.

Now, I need to summarize this in 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The author is showing that Steele's comments are seen as disloyal and inconsistent, causing internal conflict in the Republican party. The moral angle is about loyalty, consistency, and the proper stance on the war.

I should include the key points: Steele's comments, the reactions from Kristol and Senor, the inconsistency with his past statements, and the broader implications for the party. Also, note that some Democrats and conservatives agree with him, but Steele is a Republican leader, making his stance problematic.

Let me structure this: start with Steele's comments, then the reactions, mention the inconsistency, the broader impact, and end with the implications for his position. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced harsh criticism after stating that the war in Afghanistan is largely unwinnable and was Obama's choice. Prominent conservatives, including Bill Kristol, condemned Steele, with Kristol calling for his resignation. Kristol emphasized that the war began under President Bush and has been supported by Republicans, labeling Steele's remarks an embarrassment and affront to the party and its soldiers. Steele's spokesman attempted to clarify that Steele meant Obama lacked a clear strategy, but Kristol and others, like Dan Senor, remained critical, noting Steele's past support for the war. Steele's comments resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, but as RNC chairman, his stance was seen as inconsistent and damaging to the party. His tenure appears increasingly precarious amid the backlash. END OF SUMMARY.
