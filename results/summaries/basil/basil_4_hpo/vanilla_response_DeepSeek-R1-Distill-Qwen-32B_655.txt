Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, facing backlash from conservatives after he made a comment about Afghanistan being an unwinnable war chosen by Obama. 

Hmm, the article mentions that several conservatives reacted negatively. Bill Kristol wrote a letter calling for Steele's resignation. Kristol points out that the war was started under Bush and supported by Republicans, so Steele's statement was out of line. 

Steele's spokesman tried to clarify, saying Steele meant Obama didn't have a clear strategy, not that the war was his choice. But Kristol wasn't the only one criticizing; Dan Senor also called the comments irresponsible. Senor noted that Steele's RNC had previously supported Obama's surge in Afghanistan, which makes his recent comments inconsistent.

Wait, the article also mentions that some anti-war Democrats and conservative critics like Joe Scarborough agree with Steele's skepticism, but Steele isn't in that camp. His position as RNC chairman is shaky now, especially after Kristol's call for resignation, which is being pushed by GOP operatives.

So, I need to capture all these points in a concise summary. I'll start by stating that Steele faced backlash for his comment. Then mention Kristol's letter and the clarification. Highlight the inconsistency with Steele's past support. Note the reactions from Senor and the alignment with anti-war groups. Finally, mention the impact on his position and the efforts to spread the story.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be brief but include all key elements: who reacted, what they said, Steele's clarification, the inconsistency, reactions from others, and the implications for his position.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), faced harsh criticism from prominent conservatives after stating that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. Bill Kristol, a influential Republican voice, called for Steele’s resignation, arguing that the war was initiated under President Bush and consistently supported by Republicans. Steele’s spokesman attempted to clarify his remarks, stating Steele meant Obama lacked a clear strategy, not that the war was his choice. However, Kristol and others, including Dan Senor, criticized the comments as inconsistent with Steele’s past support for the war, such as praising Obama’s Afghan surge. Steele’s statements resonated with anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics, but as RNC chairman, his remarks were seen as embarrassing and out of step with the party. Kristol’s call for resignation gained traction, with GOP operatives promoting the story to highlight Steele’s precarious position. END OF SUMMARY.
