SUMMARY:

RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation, stating that Steele's comment was an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Other conservatives, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's remarks as "utterly irresponsible" and inconsistent with his previous statements supporting the war effort. Steele's comments, however, resonated with anti-war Democrats who share skepticism about the war's winnability. The controversy has put Steele's tenure as RNC chairman in jeopardy, with some GOP operatives hoping to spread the narrative of Steele's troubles.
