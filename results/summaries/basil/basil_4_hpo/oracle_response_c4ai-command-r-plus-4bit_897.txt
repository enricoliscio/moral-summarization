SUMMARY: Several prominent conservatives were quick to criticize Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, after he made comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable and a choice made by President Obama. Bill Kristol, an influential voice among Republican lawmakers, called for Steele's resignation in a letter published on his Weekly Standard site. Kristol argued that Steele's comments were an "affront" to the Republican Party and the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan, and that the war has been prosecuted under both Presidents Bush and Obama with consistent support from Republicans. Other neoconservative figures, such as Dan Senor, also criticized Steele's comments as irresponsible and inconsistent with his previous statements, where he once proclaimed that Afghanistan is "a war we have to win." Steele's comments, however, found resonance among anti-war Democrats and some conservative critics of the deployment in Afghanistan. Despite the backlash, Steele's spokesman tried to clarify his remarks, emphasizing that he believed Obama lacked a winning strategy.
END OF SUMMARY.
