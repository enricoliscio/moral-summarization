SUMMARY:
Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, is set to outline his approach to foreign policy, which prioritizes ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving the moral clarity of America's core values. Rubio's first priority is to "adequately fund" the nation's military, emphasizing the need for a strong defense even in times of peace and stability. He promises to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, and cyberspace, and to support the spread of economic and political freedom. Rubio also vows to reinforce alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities who are often persecuted. He emphasizes that the American people hear the cries and see the suffering of afflicted peoples, and desire their freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
