SUMMARY:
Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, is set to outline his approach to foreign policy in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Rubio's doctrine is built on three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving the moral clarity of America's core values. He prioritizes adequately funding the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. Rubio vows to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space, and to support the spread of economic and political freedom. He promises to reinforce alliances, resist efforts to subjugate smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities who are often persecuted. Rubio's vision is to promote freedom and protect the afflicted, ensuring that the American people hear their cries and see their suffering.
