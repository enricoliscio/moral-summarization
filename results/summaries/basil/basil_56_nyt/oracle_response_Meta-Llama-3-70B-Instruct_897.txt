SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio is set to outline his approach to foreign policy, which prioritizes preserving America's moral clarity and promoting freedom globally. His three-pillar approach focuses on ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and upholding the country's core values. Rubio's first priority is to adequately fund the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He vows to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space, including economic disruption caused by one country invading another. Rubio's vision for America's role in the world includes supporting the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances, and resisting efforts by large powers to subjugate smaller neighbors. He also promises to maintain a robust commitment to foreign assistance programs and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and religious minorities who are often persecuted. Rubio's message is clear: the American people hear the cries, see the suffering, and desire freedom for all.
