SUMMARY: On Wednesday, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a 2016 presidential candidate, will outline his approach to foreign policy in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Rubio's foreign policy approach consists of three main pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the American economy in a globalized world, and preserving the moral clarity of America's core values. Rubio emphasizes the need to "adequately fund" the nation's military and use American power to oppose any violations of international laws and norms, including economic disruptions caused by invasions. He also pledges to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist subjugation by large powers, maintain effective foreign assistance programs, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups. Rubio aims to position himself as a defense hawk and differentiate himself in a crowded primary field.
