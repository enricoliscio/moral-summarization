SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, outlined his approach to foreign policy, which prioritizes preserving America's moral clarity and promoting freedom globally. Rubio's doctrine has three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and upholding the country's core values. He vows to adequately fund the military, even in times of peace, to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space. Rubio promises to resist efforts by large powers to subjugate smaller neighbors and maintain a robust commitment to foreign assistance programs. He also aims to advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities who are often persecuted. Rubio's vision is to spread economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances and supporting the afflicted peoples of the world, who know that the American people hear their cries, see their suffering, and desire their freedom.
