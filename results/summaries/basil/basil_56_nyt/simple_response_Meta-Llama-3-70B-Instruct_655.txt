SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio is set to outline his approach to foreign policy, which is centered around three main pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the American economy, and preserving moral clarity of America's core values. Rubio's priority is to adequately fund the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He promises to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space, and to support the spread of economic and political freedom. Rubio's vision is to reinforce alliances, resist subjugation of smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities. He emphasizes that the American people desire freedom for the afflicted peoples of the world. Rubio's approach is morally framed around the idea of promoting freedom, protecting the vulnerable, and upholding America's core values.
