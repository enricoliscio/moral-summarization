Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article carefully first.

So, the article talks about how Rubio is outlining his approach with three main pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving core values. He's emphasizing funding the military, even in peaceful times, and opposing violations in international spaces like waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space. He also mentions supporting freedom, alliances, and helping vulnerable groups.

I should make sure to include the key points: the three pillars, military funding, opposition to violations, and his vision for spreading freedom and helping the vulnerable. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Maybe start with introducing Rubio and his speech, then outline each pillar briefly. Also, mention his role in Congress and how this could help his campaign.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without unnecessary details. Finally, I'll format it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, will present his foreign policy vision in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. His approach, outlined in excerpts from his speech, centers on three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy in a globalized world, and preserving the moral clarity of U.S. core values. Rubio emphasizes funding the military as a top priority, even in peaceful times, and opposes violations in international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space. He also vows to support economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist large powers' efforts to dominate smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities. Rubio, a defense hawk on the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, aims to differentiate himself in the crowded primary field with this vision. END OF SUMMARY.
