Alright, so the user has given me a task where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech and a list of morally framed words used by the author. My goal is to summarize the article while preserving as many of these moral terms as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is outlining his foreign policy with three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving core values. He emphasizes funding the military, opposing violations in various spaces, and supporting freedom and vulnerable groups.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "preserving," "fund," "oppose," "violations," "invades," "freedom," "reinforce," "resist," "subjugate," "persecuted," "hear," "cries," "see," "suffering," and "desire" are key here. I should make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral framing.

I'll start by introducing Rubio and his speech. Then, I'll mention the three pillars, making sure to use "preserving" when talking about core values. I'll note his emphasis on funding the military, using "fund." Moving on, I'll explain his opposition to violations in international spaces and the consequences of invasions, using "oppose" and "invades." 

I should highlight his commitment to freedom and support for vulnerable groups, using "freedom," "persecuted," and "desire." I'll also include his actions to reinforce alliances and resist subjugation, using "reinforce" and "resist." Finally, I'll mention how he wants the world to know that Americans hear their cries and see their suffering, using "hear," "cries," "see," and "suffering."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating all the necessary moral terms. I'll structure it in a way that each sentence builds on the next, maintaining the moral tone set by the author.
