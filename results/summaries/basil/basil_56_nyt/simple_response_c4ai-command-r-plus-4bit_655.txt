SUMMARY: In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations, Senator Marco Rubio outlined his approach to foreign policy, emphasizing three main pillars: American strength, protection of the American economy, and preservation of moral clarity. Rubio promises to "oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace or outer space" and to use American power to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, and advance the rights of the vulnerable. He also commits to adequately funding the military and maintaining a robust foreign assistance program. Rubio's foreign policy stance, a contrast to the Obama Doctrine of "Don't Do Stupid Stuff" and the Bush Doctrine of preventive strikes, highlights his position as a defense hawk and his belief in America's moral responsibility on the world stage. Rubio's speech underscores the importance he places on moral clarity and America's role in supporting freedom and protecting the vulnerable globally.
