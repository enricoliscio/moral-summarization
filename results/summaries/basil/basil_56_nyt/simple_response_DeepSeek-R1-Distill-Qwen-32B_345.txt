Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about different foreign policy doctrines: Obama's, Bush's, and now Rubio's. Rubio's approach has three pillars: military strength, protecting the economy, and preserving American values. He emphasizes funding the military even in peace, opposing violations in various spaces, and spreading freedom and helping vulnerable groups.

I need to make sure the summary highlights these points without adding my own opinions. Also, it's important to capture the moral aspect, like Rubio's commitment to helping women and religious minorities. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Let me start by outlining the main sections: introduction of Rubio's speech, the three pillars, military funding, opposition to violations, and his broader vision. I'll make sure each part is covered succinctly. Also, note that Rubio is positioning himself as a defense hawk to stand out in the primary.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary straightforward. Make sure to include that he's a 2016 candidate and his role in Congress. Maybe mention that the speech is part of his strategy to differentiate himself.

Putting it all together, I'll draft a summary that flows logically, starting with the speech context, moving through the pillars, and ending with his vision and strategy. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within limits.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure to capture all key points and maintain the moral framing as the author presented it.
