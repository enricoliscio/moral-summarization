Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is outlining his foreign policy approach, which has three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving core values. He emphasizes funding the military, opposing violations in international spaces, and promoting freedom and alliances.

I should include Rubio's background, like his position in the Senate and his role as a 2016 candidate. It's important to note that his speech is a response to previous doctrines, like Obama's and Bush's, to give context.

I'll structure the summary by introducing Rubio and his speech, then list the three pillars. I'll mention his focus on military funding, opposition to violations, and his vision for spreading freedom. I'll also touch on his stance against powerful countries oppressing smaller ones and support for vulnerable groups.

I need to keep the language clear and concise, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll avoid jargon and ensure the key points are covered without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts and ends with the specified tokens. Let me put it all together now.
