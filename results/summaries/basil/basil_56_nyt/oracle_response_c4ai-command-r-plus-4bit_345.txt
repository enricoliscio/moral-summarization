SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and presidential candidate for 2016, is set to outline his doctrine for foreign policy. Dubbed the "Rubio approach," it focuses on three main pillars: strengthening America's military might, protecting the American economy in a globalized world, and preserving the nation's moral values. Rubio emphasizes the importance of adequately funding the military to oppose any violations of international laws, including invasions of other countries, and protecting the vulnerable, such as persecuted religious minorities. He promises to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, and resist the subjugation of smaller nations by larger powers. Rubio also acknowledges the importance of effective foreign assistance programs and expresses the American people's desire for the freedom of the afflicted. His vision seeks to maintain America's strength and moral clarity on the global stage.
