SUMMARY:
Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, outlined his approach to foreign policy in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations. His doctrine is built on three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving the moral clarity of America's core values. Rubio prioritizes adequately funding the nation's military, promising to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space. He also vows to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist subjugation of smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities. Rubio's vision is to promote freedom and protect the afflicted, ensuring that the American people hear their cries, see their suffering, and desire their freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
