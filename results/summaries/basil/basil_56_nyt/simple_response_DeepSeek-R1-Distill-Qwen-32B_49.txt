Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. They want the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about the Obama Doctrine, the Bush Doctrine, and then moves on to Rubio's approach. Rubio's speech has three main pillars: military strength, protecting the economy, and preserving American values. He emphasizes funding the military even in peace, opposing violations in international spaces, and spreading freedom and helping vulnerable groups.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points. Also, the user mentioned it should be under 200 words and end with the specified tokens. I'll structure it to highlight Rubio's priorities and his moral stance on supporting freedom and protecting vulnerable people.

I should also mention that Rubio is positioning himself as a defense hawk to stand out in the primary. That adds context to his motivations. I need to keep the language clear and concise, making sure the moral elements are prominent.

Let me draft a summary that includes all these points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within 200 words. Also, I'll make sure to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.
