SUMMARY: On Wednesday, Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and presidential candidate for 2016, presented his foreign policy approach in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Rubio's foreign policy is based on three main pillars: strengthening America's military capabilities, protecting the American economy in a globalized world, and preserving America's moral values. He promises to "oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space" and emphasizes the importance of supporting economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances, and resisting the subjugation of smaller nations by larger powers. Rubio aims to maintain a robust commitment to foreign assistance and advance the rights of vulnerable groups. He also intends to prioritize adequately funding the military, even in peaceful times, to ensure America's strength and ability to defend itself. Rubio's speech highlights his position as a defense hawk and his efforts to establish himself as a prominent voice in foreign policy within the crowded primary field.
