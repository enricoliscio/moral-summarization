SUMMARY:
Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, outlined his approach to foreign policy, emphasizing the importance of American strength, a strong economy, and preserving the moral clarity of the country's core values. Rubio's priority is to adequately fund the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He promises to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space, and to support the spread of economic and political freedom. Rubio also vows to reinforce alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of the vulnerable, including women and religious minorities who are often persecuted. He believes that the American people hear the cries, see the suffering, and desire the freedom of afflicted peoples around the world. END OF SUMMARY.
