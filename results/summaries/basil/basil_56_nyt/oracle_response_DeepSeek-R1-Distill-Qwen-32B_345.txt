Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Rubio's foreign policy speech, making sure to keep the moral framing as the author presented it. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be preserved in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is outlining his foreign policy approach with three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving moral clarity. He emphasizes funding the military, opposing violations in international spaces, and supporting freedom and human rights. 

I need to make sure I include words like "preserving," "fund," "oppose," "violations," "invades," "freedom," "reinforce," "resist," "subjugate," "persecuted," "hear," "cries," "see," "suffering," and "desire." 

I'll structure the summary by mentioning Rubio's three pillars, his commitment to funding the military, opposing violations, and his broader vision of spreading freedom and supporting vulnerable groups. I should also highlight how these points reflect his moral stance. 

I'll keep each sentence concise and make sure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each key moral term is included where appropriate.
