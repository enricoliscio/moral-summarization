Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech, making sure to keep the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article starts by comparing the Obama Doctrine, Bush Doctrine, and now Rubio's approach. Rubio's speech has three pillars: American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving core values. He emphasizes funding the military, even in peace times, which is a priority. He's positioning himself as a defense hawk, which might help in the crowded primary.

In his speech, Rubio talks about opposing violations in international spaces—waters, airspace, cyberspace, outer space. He mentions economic disruptions from invasions. His broader vision includes spreading freedom, reinforcing alliances, resisting big powers subjugating smaller ones, and committing to foreign assistance. He also wants to advance the rights of vulnerable groups like women and religious minorities, showing that America cares about their suffering and desires freedom.

The author used words like preserve, fund, oppose, violations, invades, freedom, reinforce, resist, subjugate, persecuted, hear, cries, see, suffering, desire. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Rubio's three pillars, his focus on military funding, opposition to violations, and his commitment to spreading freedom and helping vulnerable groups. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well while preserving the moral language.

Let me draft it:

"Senator Marco Rubio will outline his foreign policy approach, emphasizing three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving core values. He prioritizes funding the military, even in peace, to maintain readiness. Rubio will oppose violations in international spaces and resist larger powers subjugating smaller nations. He aims to spread economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, and support vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities, ensuring their cries for freedom are heard. His vision underscores America's commitment to transparency, aid, and addressing global suffering, highlighting a desire for freedom worldwide."

I think that covers all the key points and includes the moral words. Let me check the word count—should be under 200. It looks good.
