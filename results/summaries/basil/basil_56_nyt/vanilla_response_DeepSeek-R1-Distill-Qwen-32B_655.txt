Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. The article contrasts the Obama and Bush doctrines, then focuses on Rubio's three pillars: military strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity. Rubio emphasizes funding the military, opposing violations in international spaces, and promoting freedom and alliances.

I should structure the summary to include Rubio's three pillars, his stance on military funding, opposition to violations, and his broader vision of spreading freedom and supporting vulnerable groups. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit.

I'll start by introducing Rubio and his speech, then outline each pillar briefly. I'll mention his military funding priority, opposition to violations, and his vision for the world. I'll make sure to include his commitment to alliances and helping women and religious minorities.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all key points without exceeding 200 words. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary, making sure it flows well and meets the user's requirements.
