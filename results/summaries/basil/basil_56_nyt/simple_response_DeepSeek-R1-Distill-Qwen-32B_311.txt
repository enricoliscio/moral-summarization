Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, I should make sure I capture the key points without losing the ethical perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main ideas. It's comparing Rubio's approach to Obama and Bush's doctrines. Rubio has three pillars: military strength, protecting the economy, and preserving American values. He's emphasizing funding the military, opposing violations in international spaces, and supporting freedom and human rights.

I should highlight his focus on military funding as a priority, even in peace. Also, his stance against invasions and economic disruptions. The moral clarity part is important—supporting freedom, alliances, and helping vulnerable groups like women and religious minorities.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Rubio's speech, his three pillars, and then go into specifics like military funding and opposition to violations. Finally, I'll touch on his vision for spreading freedom and helping the vulnerable, emphasizing the moral aspect.

Let me structure it: introduce Rubio and his speech, outline the pillars, detail the military and opposition points, and conclude with his broader vision and moral commitment. That should cover the main points while keeping the moral framing intact.
