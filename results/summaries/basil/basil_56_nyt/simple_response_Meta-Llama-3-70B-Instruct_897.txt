SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, is set to outline his foreign policy approach, which prioritizes American strength, economic protection, and moral clarity. Rubio's doctrine is centered around adequately funding the military, even in times of peace, to ensure American power is used to oppose international violations and promote freedom. He vows to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, and resist efforts by large powers to subjugate smaller neighbors. Rubio's approach is rooted in a strong moral foundation, emphasizing the need to advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities, and to promote freedom for afflicted peoples around the world. His speech is seen as an attempt to establish himself as a defense hawk and stand out in a crowded primary field.
