SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio is set to outline his foreign policy approach, which prioritizes American strength, economic protection, and moral clarity. Rubio's doctrine emphasizes the need for a robust military, promising to "adequately fund" the nation's defense even in times of peace. He vows to use American power to defend international waters, airspace, and cyberspace, and to resist large powers' attempts to subjugate smaller neighbors. Rubio's vision also includes promoting economic and political freedom, supporting vulnerable groups such as women and religious minorities, and advancing human rights. His approach is framed as a moral imperative, with Rubio stating that the American people "hear their cries, see their suffering and most of all, desire their freedom." This stance is likely to appeal to conservative voters and distinguish Rubio from his presidential rivals.
