SUMMARY: In a speech to be given on Wednesday, Senator Marco Rubio will outline his approach to foreign policy, which includes three main pillars: strength, economy, and morality. Rubio emphasizes the importance of adequately funding the military and using American power to uphold international laws and protect smaller nations from subjugation by larger ones. He also pledges to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, demonstrating a commitment to moral clarity and transparency in foreign aid. Rubio's vision reflects a desire to maintain American power and influence while also promoting moral values and supporting those in need, striking a balance between strength and compassion.
