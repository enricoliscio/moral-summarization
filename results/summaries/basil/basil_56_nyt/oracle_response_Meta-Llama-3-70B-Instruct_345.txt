Rubio's doctrine opposes any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space, including economic disruption caused by invasions. He promises to reinforce alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors, and maintain a robust commitment to transparent foreign assistance programs. Rubio's vision aims to advance the rights of the vulnerable, including women and religious minorities who are often persecuted.
