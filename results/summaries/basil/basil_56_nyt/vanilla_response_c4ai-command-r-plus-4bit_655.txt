SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and a 2016 presidential candidate, outlined his approach to foreign policy in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations.

He promises to use American power to uphold international laws and protect smaller nations from subjugation by larger powers. Rubio emphasizes the importance of supporting economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances, and advancing the rights of vulnerable groups. He also pledges to maintain a commitment to transparent and effective foreign assistance programs. Rubio aims to present himself as a defense hawk, distinguishing himself from the other candidates in the crowded primary field.
