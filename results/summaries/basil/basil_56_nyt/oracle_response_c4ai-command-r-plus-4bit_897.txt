SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and presidential candidate for 2016, is set to outline his doctrine for foreign policy. His approach is built on three pillars: strengthening America's military might, protecting its economy in a globalized world, and preserving the moral clarity of American values. Mr. Rubio prioritizes funding and strengthening the military to oppose violations of international laws, including invasions of other countries and their economic disruptions. He vows to support the spread of freedom, reinforce alliances, resist the subjugation of smaller nations, and aid the vulnerable and persecuted. Mr. Rubio's vision emphasizes the use of American power to maintain transparency in foreign assistance programs and uphold the rights of those whose cries for freedom and against suffering are heard by the American people.
