Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about different foreign policy doctrines: Obama's, Bush's, and now Rubio's. Rubio's speech has three main pillars: American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving moral clarity. He emphasizes funding the military, opposing violations in international spaces, and supporting freedom and human rights.

I should highlight Rubio's focus on military funding as a priority, his stance against invasions and violations, and his commitment to spreading freedom and aiding vulnerable groups. Also, note his positioning as a defense hawk to stand out in the primary.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects, like supporting freedom and helping the vulnerable. I'll structure it to first mention Rubio's speech, outline the pillars, then his specific commitments and goals.

Let me draft it, ensuring it's clear and sticks to the key points without getting too detailed. I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has outlined his foreign policy approach in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations. His policy is centered on three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the U.S. economy in a globalized world, and preserving the moral clarity of America’s core values. Rubio emphasizes the need to “adequately fund” the military, even in times of peace, and opposes violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space. He also vows to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, and resist efforts by larger powers to subjugate smaller neighbors. Rubio’s speech highlights a commitment to advancing the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities, and to ensuring that the American people are seen as defenders of freedom and justice on the global stage. His approach reflects a blend of military strength and moral leadership, positioning him as a defense hawk in the crowded Republican primary field. END OF SUMMARY.
