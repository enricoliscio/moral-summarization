SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, is set to outline his approach to foreign policy, which is built on three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving moral clarity. Rubio's priority is to adequately fund the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He promises to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space, including economic disruption caused by invasions. Rubio's vision is to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist subjugation of smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and religious minorities. His approach is rooted in a moral framework, emphasizing the importance of promoting freedom and protecting the afflicted. Rubio's stance is a departure from the Obama Doctrine's "Don't Do Stupid Stuff" approach and the Bush Doctrine's emphasis on preventive strikes.
