SUMMARY: In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations, Senator Marco Rubio outlined his approach to foreign policy, which includes three main pillars: strengthening America's military might, protecting the US economy in a globalized world, and preserving moral clarity. Rubio emphasizes the need to "adequately fund" the military and use American power to oppose violations of international laws and economic disruptions caused by invasions. He also promises to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist subjugation by large powers, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups. Rubio aims to present himself as a defense hawk, distinguishing himself in the crowded Republican primary field.
