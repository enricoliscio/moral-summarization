SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, will outline his foreign policy approach in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. His approach has three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and preserving moral clarity. Rubio's top priority is to adequately fund the military, even in times of peace and stability. He promises to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space, and to prevent economic disruption caused by invasions. Rubio also vows to support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist subjugation of smaller nations, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities. His goal is to promote freedom and let afflicted peoples know that the American people hear their cries and desire their freedom.
