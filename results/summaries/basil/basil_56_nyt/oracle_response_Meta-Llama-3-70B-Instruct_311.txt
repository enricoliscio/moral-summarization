SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio is set to outline his approach to foreign policy, which is built on three pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the American economy, and preserving the moral clarity of America's core values. Rubio's top priority is to "adequately fund" the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He vows to use American power to "oppose any violations" of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space, including economic disruption caused by one country invading another. Rubio's vision for America's role in the world includes supporting the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances, resisting efforts by large powers to subjugate smaller neighbors, and advancing the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and religious minorities who are often persecuted. He promises that as president, he will "hear their cries, see their suffering, and desire their freedom."
