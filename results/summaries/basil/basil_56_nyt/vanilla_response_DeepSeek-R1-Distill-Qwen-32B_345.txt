Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by comparing the Obama Doctrine and the Bush Doctrine, but the focus is on Rubio's approach. He's outlining his foreign policy in a speech, and it has three main pillars. The first is ensuring American strength, which means adequately funding the military even in peaceful times. The second is protecting the American economy in a globalized world, so he's concerned about economic disruptions caused by invasions. The third is preserving America's core values, like moral clarity.

Rubio is positioning himself as a defense hawk, which might help him in the crowded Republican primary. His speech also mentions opposing violations in international spacesâ€”waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space. He wants to spread economic and political freedom, reinforce alliances, resist big powers oppressing smaller neighbors, commit to foreign assistance, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups like women and religious minorities.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the three pillars, his focus on military funding, economic protection, and moral values. Also, mention his goal to spread freedom, support alliances, and help vulnerable groups. I should make sure the summary is concise and captures all key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with Rubio outlining his foreign policy, mention the three pillars, explain each briefly, his stance as a defense hawk, his vision for spreading freedom, and his commitment to vulnerable groups. Keep it under 200 words.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and covers all the main points without exceeding the word limit.
