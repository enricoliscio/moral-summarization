SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio outlines his foreign policy approach, the Rubio approach, which focuses on American strength, economic protection, and moral clarity. Rubio prioritizes funding for the military and using American power to oppose violations of international laws and economic disruptions caused by invasions. He also emphasizes supporting the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances, resisting subjugation of smaller nations by larger ones, and advancing the rights of vulnerable groups. Rubio's vision highlights the use of American power to maintain global stability and promote freedom and human rights. He sees the United States as a force for good in the world, hearing the cries of the afflicted and seeking their freedom. This moral framework guides his foreign policy approach, presenting a stark contrast to the isolationist "Don't Do Stupid Stuff" doctrine and the interventionist Bush Doctrine.
