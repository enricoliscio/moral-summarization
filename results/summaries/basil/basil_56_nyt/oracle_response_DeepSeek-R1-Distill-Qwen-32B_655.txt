Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. I should look for the morally charged words listed and make sure they're included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is outlining his foreign policy approach with three pillars: military strength, protecting the economy, and preserving American values. He emphasizes funding the military, opposing violations in international spaces, and supporting freedom and human rights.

Now, I'll identify the key morally framed words: preserving, fund, oppose, violations, invades, freedom, reinforce, resist, subjugate, persecuted, hear, cries, see, suffering, desire.

I need to include as many of these as possible. I'll structure the summary by mentioning the pillars, Rubio's priorities, and his vision for the US's role, highlighting the moral aspects.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral term is appropriately placed without making it sound forced.

Wait, the user also mentioned that I should return the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to format it correctly.

I think I've covered all the points. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.
