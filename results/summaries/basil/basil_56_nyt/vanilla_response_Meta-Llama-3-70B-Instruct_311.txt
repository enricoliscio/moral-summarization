SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, will outline his approach to foreign policy in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. His approach has three main pillars: ensuring American strength, protecting the American economy, and preserving moral clarity of America's core values. Rubio's first priority is to adequately fund the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He promises to use American power to oppose violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space, and to support the spread of economic and political freedom. Rubio also vows to reinforce alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate smaller neighbors, and advance the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and religious minorities. His goal is to promote freedom and let afflicted peoples know that the American people hear their cries and desire their freedom.
