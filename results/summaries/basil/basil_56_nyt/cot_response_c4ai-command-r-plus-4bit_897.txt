SUMMARY: In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations, Senator Marco Rubio outlined his approach to foreign policy, emphasizing three key pillars: strength, protection, and moral clarity. Rubio pledges to prioritize funding for the military and use American power to oppose violations of international norms and to resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors. He promises to reinforce alliances and maintain a commitment to transparent foreign assistance programs. Rubio's vision for America's role in the world includes advancing the rights of the vulnerable and supporting the spread of economic and political freedom. He emphasizes the importance of hearing the cries and seeing the suffering of afflicted peoples, desiring their freedom above all else. Rubio's foreign policy doctrine reflects a desire to balance strength and protectionism with a moral commitment to freedom and assistance for those in need. END OF SUMMARY.
