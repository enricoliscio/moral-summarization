SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, is set to outline his foreign policy approach, which prioritizes preserving America's moral clarity and core values. His three-pillar approach focuses on ensuring American strength, protecting the economy, and promoting freedom. Rubio's first priority is to adequately fund the nation's military, even in times of peace and stability. He vows to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space, including economic disruption caused by invasions. Rubio's vision for America's role in the world involves spreading economic and political freedom, reinforcing alliances, resisting subjugation of smaller neighbors, and advancing the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and religious minorities.
