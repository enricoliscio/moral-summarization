SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has been targeted by Newsweek with a cover story titled "The Queen of Rage," accompanied by an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill has called out the magazine for its sexist depiction, citing a test by founder Gloria Steinem: would they do the same to a man? O'Neill argues that the title is meant to cast Bachmann as a "nut job" and that the magazine's actions are misogynistic. NOW is standing up for Bachmann despite disagreeing with her on almost every issue, as they want women to feel encouraged to run for office without fear of such attacks. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, condemns the magazine's journalistic dishonesty, advising conservatives to steer clear of these untrustworthy venues and demand editorial oversight. Newsweek has defended the photo, but the backlash suggests that the magazine has crossed a line.
