SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has been the subject of what some are calling "sexist" and "misogynistic" attacks by Newsweek magazine, which featured an unflattering photo of her on its cover with the headline "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill criticized the magazine's depiction of Bachmann, arguing that they would not treat a male politician in the same way. Others, such as Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, have also called out the magazine for its dishonesty and conservative bias. Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, but others have defended her, saying that such attacks are unacceptable and could deter women from running for office.

END OF SUMMARY.
