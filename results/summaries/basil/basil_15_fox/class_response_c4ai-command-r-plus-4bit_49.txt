SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has found an unlikely defender in the National Organization for Women (NOW) after a controversial Newsweek cover story branded her "The Queen of Rage." NOW President Terry O'Neill criticized the magazine's depiction of Bachmann as "sexist" and "misogynistic," arguing that such attacks on a prominent female politician could deter other women from running for office. While Bachmann herself has remained largely silent on the issue, others have joined in condemning Newsweek for what they perceive as a pattern of dishonest and biased representations of conservatives. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, echoed O'Neill's sentiment, urging conservatives to steer clear of such publications or at least demand editorial oversight to prevent similar incidents in the future. The magazine, however, defended its choice of photo, claiming that several of the images taken of Bachmann had a similar appearance.
END OF SUMMARY.
