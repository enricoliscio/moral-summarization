SUMMARY:
Rep. Michele Bachmann has been targeted by Newsweek with a cover story titled "The Queen of Rage," accompanied by an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill has condemned the cover as "sexist" and "misogynistic," arguing that the magazine would not use similar language to describe a male candidate. O'Neill believes that Newsweek is casting Bachmann as a "nut job" and that such attacks will deter women from running for office. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, has also criticized the magazine, calling it "journalistic dishonesty." Bachmann herself has declined to comment on the cover, saying she hasn't seen it. The controversy has sparked a debate about the media's treatment of conservative politicians and the impact on women in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
