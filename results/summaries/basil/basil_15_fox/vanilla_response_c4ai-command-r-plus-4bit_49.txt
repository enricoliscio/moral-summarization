SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine featured a cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann with the headline "The Queen of Rage," accompanied by a close-up photo of Bachmann that some have deemed unflattering. The National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, called the cover "sexist," arguing that the magazine would not have used similar language or imagery for a male candidate. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, also criticized the magazine for its treatment of conservatives. Bachmann herself declined to comment on the cover, while Newsweek defended the photo, stating that several of the images taken of her appeared similar. The incident has sparked a debate about the portrayal of female politicians in the media and the potential impact on women's participation in politics.
