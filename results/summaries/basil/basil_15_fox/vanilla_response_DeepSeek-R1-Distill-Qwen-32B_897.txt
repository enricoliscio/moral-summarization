Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Rep. Michele Bachmann and the Newsweek cover. I need to make sure I understand the key points first. The article says that Bachmann didn't engage with Newsweek over the "Queen of Rage" cover, but others criticized the magazine. Terry O'Neill from NOW called it sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test about whether they'd do the same for a man. She pointed out that they wouldn't call a man "The King of Rage," implying gender bias. O'Neill also mentioned that they want more women to run for office, so they're standing up for Bachmann despite disagreeing with her policies.

On the other side, Newsweek defended their photo, saying other images of Bachmann were similar and some were flattering. Bachmann herself hadn't seen the cover but was aware of the headline. Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center criticized the magazine's bias against conservatives and suggested they're dishonest.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating that Bachmann didn't respond to the cover, then mention the criticism from NOW and Bozell. I should include the points about sexism, the comparison to men, and the defense from Newsweek. Also, note Bachmann's reaction and the broader implications about media bias and women in politics.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all the main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it: mention the cover, Bachmann's response, the criticism from NOW and Bozell, Newsweek's defense, and Bachmann's comment. Then wrap up with the implications on media bias and women in politics.

I need to check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence adds necessary information without redundancy. Okay, I think that's a solid plan.
