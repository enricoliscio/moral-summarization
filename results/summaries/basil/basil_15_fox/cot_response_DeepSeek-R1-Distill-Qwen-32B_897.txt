Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words as per the user's instructions. The article talks about Newsweek's cover of Michele Bachmann, which is criticized as sexist and misogynistic. So, words like "sexist," "misogynistic," "dishonesty," "unflattering," "nut job," and "crazy" stand out as morally charged terms. 

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should mention Bachmann's response, the criticism from Terry O'Neill and Brent Bozell, and the defense from Newsweek. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the identified moral terms. 

I'll start by stating that Bachmann declined to comment on the cover. Then, introduce O'Neill's criticism, using "sexist" and "misogynistic." Mention Bozell's point about journalistic dishonesty. Finally, note Newsweek's defense of the photo and Bachmann's intention to review the cover. 

I should ensure the summary flows logically and includes all key points while preserving the moral language. Let me put it all together concisely.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rep. Michele Bachmann has not commented on Newsweek's cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's portrayal is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, stating it unfairly labels Bachmann as a "nut job" and questioned if such a title would be applied to a male candidate. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center called the coverage dishonest, noting similar treatment of conservatives by Newsweek and Time. Newsweek defended the photo, claiming it was part of a series and that other images were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but would review it. O'Neill emphasized the importance of protecting women in politics, even while opposing Bachmann. END OF SUMMARY.
