SUMMARY: Newsweek's depiction of Rep. Michele Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage" has been criticized by the National Organization for Women as sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill, the president of NOW, argued that the magazine's cover story and unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican cast Bachmann as a "nut job," and questioned why a serious presidential contender was being treated in such a disrespectful manner. O'Neill and others, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, accused Newsweek of journalistic dishonesty and out-of-bounds attacks. They argue that such depictions of female politicians discourage women from entering politics and send a message that they will be treated unfairly. Bachmann herself has not commented on the controversy, simply stating that "we'll have to take a look at that." The magazine, however, has defended its choice of photos, claiming that several of the images taken of Bachmann appeared similar.
END OF SUMMARY.
