Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michele Bachmann and the Newsweek cover. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, so I have to be efficient.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the magazine's cover titled "The Queen of Rage" with an unflattering photo of Bachmann. Some people, like Terry O'Neill from NOW, are criticizing the cover as sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test about gender bias. They argue that such titles are usually applied to men differently. Newsweek defended their photo choice, saying it's just one of several images taken. Bachmann herself didn't comment on the cover when asked but mentioned she hadn't seen it. Others, like Brent Bozell, criticized the magazine's bias against conservatives.

I need to structure the summary to include the key elements: the cover's title, the criticism from NOW, the defense by Newsweek, Bachmann's reaction, and the broader criticism of media bias. I should keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I'll start by mentioning the cover and the criticism. Then explain NOW's argument about gender bias. Next, note Newsweek's defense and Bachmann's response. Finally, include Bozell's point about media bias. I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

I also need to make sure the summary is under 200 words. Let me count the words as I draft to stay within the limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the essential information.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the controversy, the arguments from both sides, and the implications for women in politics. That should cover the main aspects of the article concisely.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story titled "The Queen of Rage," which features an unflattering photo of her. Critics, including National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill, argue the cover is sexist, using Gloria Steinem's gender bias test to highlight the magazine's double standard. O'Neill claims Newsweek is portraying Bachmann as a "nut job," a label rarely applied to male politicians. Newsweek defended the photo, stating it was one of several taken and that other images of Bachmann on its website are flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but would look into it. O'Neill emphasized the need to protect women running for office from such misogynistic attacks, while conservative commentator Brent Bozell criticized the magazine for bias against conservatives. END OF SUMMARY.
