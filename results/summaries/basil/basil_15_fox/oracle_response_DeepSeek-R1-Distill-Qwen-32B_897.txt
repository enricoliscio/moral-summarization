Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Michele Bachmann and Newsweek's cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." Some people, like Terry O'Neill, are calling the magazine sexist and misogynistic. They argue that such language isn't applied to male politicians. Others, like Brent Bozell, criticize the media for dishonesty and lack of oversight.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Bachmann's response, then O'Neill's accusations, the comparison to male politicians, the magazine's defense, and Bozell's criticism. I'll make sure to use words like sexist, misogynistic, dishonesty, and oversight.

I should structure it clearly, ensuring each point flows logically. I'll avoid adding any new information beyond what's in the article. Let me check the word count to make sure it's concise.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story labeling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's portrayal is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, using Gloria Steinem's test: would the same label apply to a man? She accused Newsweek of casting Bachmann as a "nut job" and questioned the magazine's fairness, noting it wouldn't apply such language to male politicians like Howard Dean. Newsweek defended its photo, stating it was consistent with other images of Bachmann, some of which were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but acknowledged the story. O'Neill emphasized the need to protect women running for office, even while opposing Bachmann's policies. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center called the cover an example of journalistic dishonesty, urging conservatives to avoid such outlets. END OF SUMMARY.
