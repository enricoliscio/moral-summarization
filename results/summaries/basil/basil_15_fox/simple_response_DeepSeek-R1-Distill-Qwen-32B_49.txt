Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and the Newsweek cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." The author's moral stance seems to be against the magazine's portrayal, highlighting sexism and bias.

First, I'll identify the key points: Bachmann's refusal to comment, NOW's criticism as sexist, the comparison to male politicians, the magazine's defense, Bachmann's reaction, and the broader implications for women in politics.

I should structure the summary to reflect the criticism of Newsweek's approach, emphasizing the sexist angle and the impact on female candidates. I'll make sure to include Terry O'Neill's points and the comparison to male politicians, as well as the defense from Newsweek and Bachmann's response.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”highlighting the unfair treatment of female politicians by the media. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language formal yet clear.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each key point is included and the moral critique is evident.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not commented on Newsweek's cover story dubbing her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the portrayal is sexist. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women (NOW) criticized the magazine, noting that such language would not be applied to a male candidate, calling it a misogynistic attack. O'Neill emphasized the importance of fair treatment for female politicians to encourage more women to run for office. Newsweek defended its photo, stating it was consistent with other images of Bachmann, some of which were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but acknowledged the story. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center condemned the magazine's bias against conservatives, urging them to avoid such outlets. The incident highlights concerns about media bias and its impact on female political candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
