SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has refused to engage with Newsweek over its controversial cover story, which features an unflattering photo of her and labels her "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has condemned the depiction as "sexist," citing a test by founder Gloria Steinem that questions whether the magazine would use a similar label for a male candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the cover is a "misogynistic attack" that casts Bachmann as "a nut job." O'Neill defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on most issues, to promote women's participation in politics. Media critics like Brent Bozell also condemn the cover, calling it "sheer journalistic dishonesty" and advising conservatives to avoid such biased publications. The controversy highlights the need for editorial oversight to prevent such dishonest and sexist depictions.
