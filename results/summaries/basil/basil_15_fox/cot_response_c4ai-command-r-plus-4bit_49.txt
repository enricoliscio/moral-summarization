SUMMARY: 
Rep. Michele Bachmann has been the subject of moral outrage after Newsweek featured her as "The Queen of Rage" on its cover. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill deemed the cover "sexist" and "misogynistic," arguing that such demeaning treatment would never be afforded to a male politician. O'Neill defended Bachmann, stating that such attacks discourage women from entering politics, despite political differences. Brent Bozell, a media critic, concurred that the magazine has a history of dishonest treatment of conservatives. The controversial cover, featuring an unflattering photo of Bachmann, has sparked accusations of sexism and unfair characterization, with critics questioning whether a man would be subjected to similar treatment. Bachmann herself has not directly responded to the controversy, choosing instead to focus on her campaign trail in Iowa. END OF SUMMARY.
