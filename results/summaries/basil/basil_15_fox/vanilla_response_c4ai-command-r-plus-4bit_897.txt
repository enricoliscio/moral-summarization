SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has come under fire for its recent cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill criticized the magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as sexist, arguing that the term "queen of rage" is demeaning and would not be used for a male candidate. O'Neill also pointed out that the magazine's use of an unflattering photo of Bachmann was inappropriate and unfair. Bachmann herself has not directly addressed the controversy, but others have come to her defense, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, who called the magazine's treatment of conservatives dishonest. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate about the portrayal of female politicians in the media and the challenges women face when running for office.
