SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to comment on Newsweek's cover story, which labels her "The Queen of Rage" with an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized the cover, calling it "sexist" and arguing that a similar depiction would not be used for a male candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill said the magazine is implying that Bachmann is "crazy" and that such attacks could deter women from running for office. Other conservatives, including Brent Bozell, have also condemned the cover, accusing Newsweek of "journalistic dishonesty" and suggesting that conservatives should avoid the magazine. Newsweek has defended the photo, saying it is one of several similar images taken of Bachmann. Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, saying she had not seen it.

END OF SUMMARY.
