SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with many criticizing the magazine for its sexist depiction of the congresswoman. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering close-up photo of Bachmann, which has been described as "casting her as a nut job" by National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill. O'Neill and other critics argue that the magazine would not have treated a male candidate in the same way and that such treatment discourages women from running for office. While Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, others have come to her defense, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, who called the magazine's treatment of conservatives "journalistic dishonesty." Newsweek, however, has defended the photo, stating that several of the images taken of Bachmann appeared similar. The magazine also posted other, more flattering photos of Bachmann on its website.
