Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me first read through the article to understand the context.

The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and Newsweek's cover story titled "The Queen of Rage." Bachmann hasn't commented, but others are criticizing the magazine. Terry O'Neill from NOW calls it sexist and uses the term "misogynistic attacks." She also mentions the importance of defending Bachmann to encourage women in politics. Newsweek defends their photo choice, saying other images are flattering. Bachmann hasn't seen the cover yet. Brent Bozell criticizes Newsweek and Time for dishonesty towards conservatives.

Now, I need to extract the key points and incorporate the moral words: depiction, sexist, referred, misogynistic, attacks, defeat, sheer, dishonesty, oversight.

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Bachmann's response, then O'Neill's criticism using "sexist" and "misogynistic attacks." Mention the photo defense and Bachmann's comment. Then Bozell's criticism about dishonesty and the call for oversight.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each moral term is included where appropriate. Also, ensure the summary flows logically, covering the main points without extra details.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story, "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the depiction is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the magazine for applying a label like "Queen of Rage" to a female presidential candidate, a term she said would not be used for a man. O'Neill called the coverage an attack on Bachmann, emphasizing the need to defend women in politics. Newsweek defended its photo, noting it was part of a series and other images were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but acknowledged the story. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center criticized Newsweek and Time for sheer journalistic dishonesty in their treatment of conservatives, urging them to demand editorial oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
