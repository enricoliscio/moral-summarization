SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has been the subject of "sexist" and "misogynistic" attacks by Newsweek magazine, according to the National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill. The magazine's cover story on Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage," featured an unflattering photo of the Republican presidential candidate, and O'Neill argued that the magazine would not have treated a male candidate in the same way. Brent Bozell, a media critic, also criticized the magazine for its "journalistic dishonesty" in its portrayal of conservatives. Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, but others have spoken out against the depiction, arguing that it is unfair and could discourage women from running for office.

END OF SUMMARY.
