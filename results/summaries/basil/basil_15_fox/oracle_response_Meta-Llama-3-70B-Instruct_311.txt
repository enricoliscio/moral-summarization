SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has refused to engage with Newsweek over its cover story, which features an unflattering photo of her and labels her "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has condemned the cover as "sexist" and "misogynistic," arguing that the magazine would not treat a male candidate similarly. NOW President Terry O'Neill stated that the cover is an attempt to cast Bachmann as a "nut job" and that it's unacceptable for a serious presidential contender. O'Neill emphasized that her organization, which disagrees with Bachmann on most issues, is defending her against these attacks because they want to encourage women to run for office. Media critics have also weighed in, calling the cover "journalistic dishonesty" and advising conservatives to steer clear of such biased publications. The controversy has sparked a debate about the media's treatment of female politicians and the need for editorial oversight to prevent such "dishonesty." END OF SUMMARY.
