SUMMARY: Newsweek's cover story on presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with many criticizing the magazine for its sexist and misogynistic portrayal. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering photo of Bachmann and has been deemed by the National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill as a sexist attack that would not be applied to a male candidate. O'Neill argues that such depictions discourage women from running for office and that Newsweek's portrayal of Bachmann as a "nut job" is unacceptable for a serious contender for president. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, also criticized the magazine's treatment of conservatives, highlighting a pattern of journalistic dishonesty. Bachmann herself has not engaged in the controversy, simply stating that "we'll have to take a look at that." The incident raises important questions about the ethical boundaries of journalistic portrayal and the potential impact on women's political participation.
