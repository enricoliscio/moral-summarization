SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann, a presidential candidate, has been featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine with an unflattering photo and the title "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized the cover as "sexist," arguing that a similar depiction would not be used for a male candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill stated that the magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as "crazy" is unacceptable and could deter women from running for office. Bachmann herself has declined to comment on the cover. Conservative critics, such as Brent Bozell, have also condemned the magazine's tactics as "journalistic dishonesty." Bozell suggests that conservatives should avoid interacting with Newsweek and similar publications due to their biased reporting.

END OF SUMMARY.
