Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story titled "The Queen of Rage." The cover has an unflattering photo of her, and she didn't comment on it directly. However, others are criticizing the magazine. Terry O'Neill from NOW calls the cover "sexist" and uses a test by Gloria Steinem to argue that the same wouldn't be done to a man. She mentions that Newsweek is portraying Bachmann as a "nut job" and compares it to how they wouldn't do this to Howard Dean. Newsweek defends the photo, saying other images of Bachmann are flattering. Bachmann herself said she hadn't seen the cover but would look into it. O'Neill also states that they're defending Bachmann to encourage more women to run for office, even though they oppose her. Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center accuses Newsweek of journalistic dishonesty and says conservatives should avoid such media.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping in mind the moral words: out, sexist, nut, this, misogynistic, run, get, dishonesty, oversight. I should include as many as possible without forcing them in.

I'll start by mentioning Bachmann's response, then the criticism from O'Neill, using "sexist" and "nut job." Then, mention the comparison to Dean. Newsweek's defense. Bachmann's comment. O'Neill's stance on encouraging women to run. Bozell's point about dishonesty and avoiding such media.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while including the key moral points.

Let me structure it:

- Bachmann didn't comment on the Newsweek cover.
- Critics, including NOW's O'Neill, call the cover sexist and compare it to wrestlers or nuts.
- O'Neill questions if they'd do this to a man, referencing Dean.
- Newsweek defends the photo, showing other flattering images.
- Bachmann says she hasn't seen the cover but will check.
- O'Neill supports Bachmann to encourage women to run for office, despite opposing her.
- Bozell accuses Newsweek of dishonesty and suggests conservatives avoid such media.

Now, I'll put this together, ensuring the moral words are included.

She accused Newsweek of casting Bachmann as a "nut job," comparing it to the media's treatment of Howard Dean. Newsweek defended the photo, noting other flattering images of Bachmann were published. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but would review it. O'Neill emphasized defending Bachmann to encourage more women to run for office, despite opposing her politically.
