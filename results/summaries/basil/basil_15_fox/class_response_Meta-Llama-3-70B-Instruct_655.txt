SUMMARY:

The National Organization for Women (NOW) has condemned Newsweek's depiction of Rep. Michele Bachmann as "sexist" and "misogynistic". The magazine's cover story, titled "The Queen of Rage", features an unflattering photo of the presidential candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the magazine would not have used such a title for a male candidate, implying that the attack is gender-based. O'Neill defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on most issues, because she wants to encourage women to run for office without fear of such sexist attacks. Others, like Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, agree that the magazine's depiction is an example of "sheer journalistic dishonesty" and that conservatives should be cautious when dealing with such biased media outlets. The controversy highlights the need for editorial oversight to prevent such attacks.
