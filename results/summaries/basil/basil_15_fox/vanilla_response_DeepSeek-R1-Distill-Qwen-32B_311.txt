Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Michele Bachmann and the Newsweek cover. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Bachmann declined to comment on the Newsweek cover story titled "The Queen of Rage," which has an unflattering photo. Then, Terry O'Neill from NOW calls the cover sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test about whether they'd do the same for a man. She points out that they wouldn't call a man "The King of Rage," implying gender bias.

O'Neill also mentions that Newsweek didn't treat Howard Dean the same way when he had his famous scream, which suggests a double standard. Newsweek defended the photo, saying it's just one of several images taken, and they have other flattering photos online. Bachmann, when asked about it, said she hadn't seen the cover and would look into it.

Terry O'Neill explains that NOW supports Bachmann against this attack because they want more women in politics. Even though they oppose Bachmann's policies, they don't want such sexist media tactics to discourage other women from running. Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center criticizes Newsweek and Time for their bias against conservatives, calling it journalistic dishonesty and advising conservatives to avoid these publications.

So, the key points are: the Newsweek cover is criticized as sexist, Bachmann's response, NOW's stance on supporting her despite policy disagreements, and criticism of media bias from Bozell.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the cover's criticism, mention O'Neill's points about sexism and the comparison to men, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's reaction, and the broader implications NOW and Bozell highlight. I should keep it concise, ensuring all main points are covered without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: mention the cover and criticism, O'Neill's arguments, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's response, and the broader media bias issue. That should cover all necessary points succinctly.
