SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy due to its allegedly sexist and misogynistic portrayal of the congresswoman. The magazine's cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," featured an unflattering close-up photo of Bachmann, which has been criticized by the National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill and others as an attempt to cast Bachmann as a "nut job." O'Neill argued that the magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage" is demeaning and would not be applied to a male candidate. Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, also criticized the magazine for its biased and dishonest portrayal of conservatives. Bachmann herself has not directly addressed the controversy, but others have spoken out against the magazine's treatment of a prominent female politician, arguing that such attacks discourage women from running for office.
