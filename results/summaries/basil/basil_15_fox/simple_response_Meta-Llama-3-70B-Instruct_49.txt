SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has been accused of sexism and journalistic dishonesty for its cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, labeling her "The Queen of Rage" with an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill condemned the cover, citing a test by founder Gloria Steinem: would the magazine do the same to a man? O'Neill argued that the depiction is misogynistic and would deter good women from running for office. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, also criticized the magazine, calling it "sheer journalistic dishonesty" and advising conservatives to avoid such venues. Bachmann herself declined to comment, but others are speaking out against the magazine's biased portrayal. The incident highlights the importance of fair and respectful treatment of women in politics.
