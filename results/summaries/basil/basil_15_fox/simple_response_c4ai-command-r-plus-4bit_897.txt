SUMMARY: Newsweek's latest cover story on presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann has sparked accusations of sexism and misogyny. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering photo of Bachmann, and many, including the National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill, believe it casts her as a "nut job." O'Neill argues that the magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage" is demeaning and would not be applied to a male candidate. She also points out that such attacks discourage women from running for office. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, agrees that the magazine has a history of unfairly targeting conservatives. The incident highlights the importance of ethical standards in journalism and the need for editorial oversight to prevent biased and misleading portrayals of public figures. END OF SUMMARY.
