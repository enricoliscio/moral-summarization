SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked outrage with its cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, labeling her "The Queen of Rage" with an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill calls the cover "sexist," citing a double standard where a man would not be similarly portrayed. O'Neill argues that the magazine's depiction of Bachmann as "crazy" or "nuts" is a misogynistic attack that could deter women from running for office. Even those who disagree with Bachmann's politics, like O'Neill, are defending her against this kind of treatment. Others, like Brent Bozell, see this as part of a larger pattern of journalistic dishonesty by liberal media outlets towards conservatives. The controversy highlights the need for fair and respectful treatment of all political candidates, regardless of gender or ideology.
