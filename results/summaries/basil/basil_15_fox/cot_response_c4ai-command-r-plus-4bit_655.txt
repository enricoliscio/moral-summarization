SUMMARY: 
Rep. Michele Bachmann has found herself at the center of a moral controversy sparked by a recent Newsweek cover story titled "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized the magazine's depiction of Bachmann, calling it "sexist" and "misogynistic." Terry O'Neill, president of NOW, questioned the magazine's choice of words and photography, suggesting that such treatment would not be afforded to a male politician. She argued that the cover story casts Bachmann as a "nut job" and discourages women from entering politics. Brent Bozell, a media critic, echoed similar sentiments, accusing Newsweek of journalistic dishonesty and bias against conservatives. Bachmann herself has not directly responded to the controversy, only alluding to the situation briefly during a campaign appearance in Iowa. The magazine, however, has defended its choice of photography, claiming that several of the photos taken of Bachmann appeared similar. END OF SUMMARY.
