SUMMARY:
The National Organization for Women (NOW) has condemned Newsweek's recent cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, labeling it "sexist" and "misogynistic". The magazine's depiction of Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage" has sparked outrage, with NOW President Terry O'Neill arguing that the title would never be applied to a male candidate. O'Neill claims that the cover is an attempt to cast Bachmann as a "nut job" and that it's a "journalistic dishonesty" that undermines women's participation in politics. Bachmann herself has declined to comment on the cover, while conservative critics like Brent Bozell have accused Newsweek of perpetuating a pattern of "dishonesty" against conservative politicians. The controversy has sparked a debate about the media's treatment of female politicians and the need for editorial oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
