SUMMARY: 
Newsweek's latest cover story on presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann has sparked outrage, with many criticizing the magazine for what they perceive as a "sexist" and "misogynistic" attack. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering close-up photo of Bachmann, which has been described as casting her as a "nut job." The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill called out the magazine for its depiction of Bachmann, arguing that such misogynistic attacks discourage women from running for office. O'Neill and others question whether a man would be subjected to similar treatment, asking, "Who has ever called a man 'The King of Rage?'" Brent Bozell, a media critic, also condemned Newsweek, stating that the magazine has a history of dishonest representation of conservatives. While Bachmann herself has not directly addressed the controversy, she hinted at the need to "take a look" at the cover. The magazine, however, defended its choice of photography, claiming that several of the photos taken of Bachmann had a similar appearance. END OF SUMMARY.
