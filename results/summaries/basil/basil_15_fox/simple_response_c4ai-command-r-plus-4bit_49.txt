SUMMARY: Newsweek's cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked accusations of sexism and misogyny. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," featured an unflattering photo of Bachmann, and many, including the National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill, criticized the magazine for its portrayal of a female politician. O'Neill argued that the term "Queen of Rage" casts Bachmann as a "nut job" and questioned whether a male candidate would be subjected to similar treatment. She defended Bachmann against the "misogynistic attack," arguing that such depictions deter women from running for office. Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, also criticized Newsweek for its biased and dishonest treatment of conservatives. The magazine defended the photo, claiming that several of the images taken of Bachmann appeared similar. However, Bachmann herself chose not to engage in the controversy, only briefly acknowledging the cover story during a campaign event in Iowa.

END OF SUMMARY.
