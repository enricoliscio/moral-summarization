SUMMARY: Newsweek's cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with many, including the National Organization for Women (NOW), calling out the magazine for what they perceive as a sexist and misogynistic attack. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering photo of Bachmann, and has been criticized for casting her as a "nut job." NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the magazine would never do the same to a male politician and that such attacks discourage women from running for office. Others, like Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, agree that the magazine has a history of dishonest and biased treatment of conservatives. Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, simply stating that "we'll have to take a look at that." The incident raises questions about the ethics of journalistic oversight and the potential impact on women's political participation.
END OF SUMMARY.
