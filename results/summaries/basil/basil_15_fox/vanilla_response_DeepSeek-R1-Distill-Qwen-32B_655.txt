Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." The cover has an unflattering photo of her. 

Some people are criticizing Newsweek for being sexist. Terry O'Neill from NOW says the cover is sexist and points out that they wouldn't call a man "The King of Rage." She also mentions that this kind of portrayal discourages women from running for office. 

Newsweek defended the photo, saying it's just one of several images taken, and they have other flattering photos online. Bachmann herself hasn't seen the cover yet but was aware of the headline. 

Others, like Brent Bozell, are critical of Newsweek and Time for their treatment of conservatives. They think these magazines are dishonest and conservatives should avoid them.

So, the summary needs to include that Bachmann's cover is controversial, accusations of sexism, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's response, and the broader criticism of media bias against conservatives.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: mention the cover, the criticism, the defense, Bachmann's reaction, and the media bias part.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Also, start with the summary token and end with the end token.
