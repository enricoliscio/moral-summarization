SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover story on presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy due to its unflattering photo and headline, "The Queen of Rage." While Bachmann herself has not commented on the matter, others have criticized the magazine for its depiction of her, with the National Organization for Women (NOW) calling it "sexist" and misogynistic. NOW President Terry O'Neill argued that the magazine would not treat a male candidate in the same way and that the headline and photo cast Bachmann as a "nut job." Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, also criticized the magazine's treatment of conservatives. Newsweek has defended the photo, stating that several of the images taken of Bachmann appeared similar. Bachmann herself has not yet seen the cover, responding with a simple "Ah-hah" when told about it during a campaign event in Iowa. The controversy highlights the challenges faced by women running for political office and the potential impact of media portrayal on their public image.
