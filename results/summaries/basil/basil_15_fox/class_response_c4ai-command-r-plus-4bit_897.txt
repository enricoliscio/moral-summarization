SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has found an unlikely defender in the National Organization for Women, as the group's president, Terry O'Neill, called out Newsweek magazine for its "sexist" and "misogynistic" depiction of the Republican presidential candidate on the cover of its latest edition. O'Neill argued that the headline "The Queen of Rage" and the accompanying unflattering photo cast Bachmann as a "nut job," and questioned whether a male candidate would be subjected to the same treatment. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center echoed these sentiments, criticizing the magazine's "sheer journalistic dishonesty." Bachmann herself declined to comment on the controversy, simply stating that "we'll have to take a look at that." The incident has sparked a broader discussion about the treatment of women in politics and the potential deterrent effect of such attacks on women's participation in public office.
END OF SUMMARY.
