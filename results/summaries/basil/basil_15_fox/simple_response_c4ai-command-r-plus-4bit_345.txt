SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has come under fire for its recent cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill has criticized the magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as sexist and misogynistic, arguing that such depictions discourage women from running for political office. O'Neill and others have questioned the magazine's ethics and journalistic integrity, suggesting that the unflattering photo and headline would not have been used for a male candidate. Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, echoed similar sentiments, accusing Newsweek and Time of engaging in similar tactics against conservatives for years. While Bachmann herself has not directly addressed the controversy, she has chosen to focus on her campaign in Iowa. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about the portrayal of women in media and the potential impact on their participation in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
