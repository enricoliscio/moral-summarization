SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has come under fire for her depiction as "The Queen of Rage" on the cover of Newsweek magazine, with many, including the National Organization for Women, calling the image sexist and misogynistic. The photo, an extreme close-up of Bachmann with a dark blue background, has been criticized for its unflattering portrayal and for the use of a derogatory term that would not likely be applied to a male candidate. Others have also spoken out against the magazine's apparent lack of oversight and sheer dishonesty in its portrayal of conservatives. Bachmann herself has not engaged in the debate, simply stating that "we'll have to take a look at that." The incident has sparked concerns that such attacks could deter good women from running for office. 

END OF SUMMARY.
