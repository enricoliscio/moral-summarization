SUMMARY:
Rep. Michele Bachmann has been depicted as "The Queen of Rage" on the cover of Newsweek magazine, accompanied by an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill has called the cover "sexist" and accused the magazine of casting Bachmann as a "nut job". O'Neill argues that the magazine would not have used a similar title for a male candidate, and that this kind of "misogynistic attack" could deter women from running for office. Bachmann herself has declined to comment on the cover. Critics, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, have accused Newsweek of "journalistic dishonesty" and of having a history of unfairly targeting conservatives. The controversy has sparked a debate about the media's treatment of female politicians and the importance of fair representation.
