SUMMARY:

The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized Newsweek magazine for its cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, labeling it "sexist" and "misogynistic". The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage", features an unflattering photo of Bachmann, which NOW president Terry O'Neill argues would not be used to describe a male candidate. O'Neill defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on most issues, because she wants to encourage women to run for office without fear of unfair media treatment. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, also condemns the magazine's "journalistic dishonesty" and advises conservatives to avoid such publications. The controversy highlights the importance of fair and respectful media coverage, particularly for women in politics.
