Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story titled "The Queen of Rage." The author uses several morally charged words like "sexist," "nut," "misogynistic," "dishonesty," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I should identify the main points: Bachmann's response, the criticism from Terry O'Neill, the defense from Newsweek, and Brent Bozell's comments. I need to condense these points concisely.

I should start by mentioning Bachmann's refusal to engage with Newsweek. Then, highlight O'Neill's accusation of sexism and the comparison to male politicians. Next, note the magazine's defense and Bachmann's campaign activities. Finally, include Bozell's criticism of the media's bias and the implications for women in politics.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll structure it to cover each point succinctly, using the morally framed words where appropriate. Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each key element is included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has avoided commenting on Newsweek's cover story labeling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's portrayal is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, calling it an unfair attack on a serious presidential candidate, likening it to calling a man "The King of Rage." Newsweek defended the photo, claiming it was not unique and posted other flattering images of Bachmann online. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but would look into it. O'Neill emphasized the importance of defending women in politics, even while opposing Bachmann's policies. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center accused Newsweek and other outlets of journalistic dishonesty, urging conservatives to avoid such venues. The争议 highlights concerns about media bias and its impact on women running for office. END OF SUMMARY.
