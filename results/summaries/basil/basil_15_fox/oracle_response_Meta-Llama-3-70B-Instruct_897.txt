SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has been targeted by Newsweek with a cover story titled "The Queen of Rage," accompanied by an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill has called out the magazine for its sexist depiction, citing a simple test by founder Gloria Steinem: would they do the same to a man? O'Neill argues that the title is meant to cast Bachmann as a "nut job," and that it's a misogynistic attack. Newsweek has defended the photo, but O'Neill and others, including Brent Bozell, are not buying it. Bozell calls it "sheer journalistic dishonesty" and advises conservatives to steer clear of such venues. O'Neill, despite disagreeing with Bachmann on most issues, stands up for her against such attacks, saying that good women won't run for office if they can be treated this way. The magazine's actions are out of bounds, and it's time for some oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
