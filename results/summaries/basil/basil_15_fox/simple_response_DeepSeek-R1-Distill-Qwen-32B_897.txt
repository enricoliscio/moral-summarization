Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." The article mentions that Bachmann didn't comment on the cover, but others criticized it as sexist. Terry O'Neill from NOW says it's sexist and compares it to how a man wouldn't be labeled similarly. Newsweek defended the photo, saying other images were similar and some were flattering. Bachmann said she hadn't seen the cover but would look into it. O'Neill argues that such treatment discourages women from running for office. Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center calls it journalistic dishonesty and advises conservatives to avoid such media.

I need to summarize this in under 200 words, focusing on the moral aspects. The key points are the criticism of the cover as sexist, the comparison to men, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's response, and the implications for women in politics. Also, the conservative media criticism adds another layer of the moral argument.

I should structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, making sure to highlight the moral framing, like sexism and discouraging female candidates. I'll start by stating the cover and the criticism, then mention O'Neill's points, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's reaction, and conclude with the broader implications and Bozell's criticism.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and covers the main points without unnecessary details. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. 

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me review that to ensure my summary aligns with their expectations. The example included all the main points and the moral framing, so I should follow that structure. 

I think I have all the necessary elements. Now, I'll write the summary, keeping it concise and making sure the moral aspects are highlighted.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage," has sparked criticism for its perceived sexist portrayal of the presidential candidate. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women (NOW) argued that the label "Queen of Rage" would not be applied to a male candidate, calling it misogynistic and discouraging for women in politics. Newsweek defended the cover photo, stating it was part of a series of similar images, some of which were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, acknowledged the cover but had not seen it. O'Neill emphasized the importance of defending women candidates against such attacks to encourage more women to run for office. Conservative commentator Brent Bozell criticized Newsweek and Time for biased coverage of conservatives, urging them to avoid such media. The controversy highlights concerns about media bias and its impact on women in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
