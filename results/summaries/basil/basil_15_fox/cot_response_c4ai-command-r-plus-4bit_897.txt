SUMMARY: 
Rep. Michele Bachmann's recent Newsweek cover story has sparked controversy, with many, including the National Organization for Women (NOW), calling out the magazine for its "sexist" and "misogynistic" depiction of the presidential candidate. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering close-up photo of Bachmann, which has been criticized for casting her as a "nut job" and "crazy." NOW President Terry O'Neill questioned the magazine's ethics, asking if they would depict a man as the "King of Rage." She defended Bachmann, despite their political differences, arguing that such attacks discourage women from running for office. Brent Bozell, of the Media Research Center, echoed similar sentiments, accusing Newsweek of journalistic dishonesty and bias against conservatives. The magazine, however, defended its choice of photo, claiming that several other images of Bachmann appeared similar. Bachmann herself has not directly addressed the cover, only alluding to it briefly during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
