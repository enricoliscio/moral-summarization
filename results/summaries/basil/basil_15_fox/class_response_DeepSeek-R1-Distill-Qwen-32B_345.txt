Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of certain words. Let me start by understanding the article's content.

The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann's response to Newsweek's cover story titled "The Queen of Rage." The cover has an unflattering photo, and Bachmann hasn't commented on it. However, others, like Terry O'Neill from NOW, are criticizing the magazine for sexism. They use the "man test" to argue that Newsweek wouldn't call a male candidate "The King of Rage." O'Neill claims this portrayal is misogynistic and discourages women from running for office. Newsweek defends their photo choice, saying it's just one of many, and Bachmann herself hasn't seen the cover yet. Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center accuses Newsweek of dishonesty and bias against conservatives.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the moral words: depiction, sexist, referred, misogynistic, attacks, defeat, sheer, dishonesty, oversight. I need to ensure these words are included where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to cover Bachmann's situation, the criticism from NOW, the defense from Newsweek, Bachmann's response, and Bozell's comments. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to frame the issues as presented.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Bachmann's reaction, then NOW's criticism using the moral terms, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's comment, and Bozell's accusation of dishonesty and oversight. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear and the key points are covered concisely.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that all the required moral terms are included. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's depiction is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, using Gloria Steinem's "man test" to highlight the double standardâ€”would a male candidate be labeled "The King of Rage?" O'Neill accused Newsweek of casting Bachmann as a "nut job" and warned that such attacks discourage women from running for office. Newsweek defended its photo, stating it was one of several taken and that many were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but acknowledged the story. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center condemned the magazine for sheer journalistic dishonesty, urging conservatives to avoid such venues or demand editorial oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
