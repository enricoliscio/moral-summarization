Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." The author used specific morally charged words like "depiction," "sexist," "misogynistic," "attacks," "dishonesty," etc. I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Bachmann didn't respond to the Newsweek cover, but others criticized it. Terry O'Neill from NOW called it sexist and used a test about how they wouldn't do the same to a man. She also mentioned that Newsweek is a reputable magazine, so it's a big issue. O'Neill supports Bachmann against misogynistic attacks because they want more women in politics. Newsweek defended the photo, saying other images were similar, and Bachmann didn't comment on it when asked. Brent Bozell criticized the media for dishonesty and urged conservatives to avoid such outlets.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Bachmann's response, then O'Neill's criticism using "sexist" and "misogynistic attacks." I'll include the test about how they wouldn't call a man "The King of Rage." Then, mention O'Neill's support for Bachmann despite disagreeing with her, to encourage women in politics. Newsweek's defense and Bachmann's lack of comment. Finally, Bozell's criticism of media dishonesty and the call for editorial oversight.

I should make sure the summary flows well and doesn't exceed 200 words. Let me put it all together, ensuring I include all the key points and the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story labeling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's depiction is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, using Gloria Steinem's test: would a man be called "The King of Rage"? She accused Newsweek of casting Bachmann as a "nut job" and defended her, despite opposing her policies, to encourage more women in politics. Newsweek defended the photo, saying other images of Bachmann were similar, while Bachmann herself downplayed the cover. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center condemned the magazine for journalistic dishonesty and urged conservatives to avoid such outlets. END OF SUMMARY.
