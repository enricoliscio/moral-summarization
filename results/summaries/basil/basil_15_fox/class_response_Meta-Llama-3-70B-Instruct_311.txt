SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has refused to engage with Newsweek over its cover story, which features an unflattering photo and labels her "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has condemned the depiction as "sexist," citing a test by founder Gloria Steinem that questions whether the magazine would use a similar label for a man. NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the cover is a "misogynistic attack" that casts Bachmann as "a nut job." O'Neill defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on most issues, because she wants to encourage women to run for office. The Media Research Center's Brent Bozell calls the cover "sheer journalistic dishonesty" and advises conservatives to avoid such venues or demand editorial oversight. Newsweek has defended the photo, saying it is one of several similar images taken of Bachmann.
