SUMMARY:

The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized Newsweek magazine for its recent cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, labeling it as "sexist" and "misogynistic." The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering photo of Bachmann, which NOW President Terry O'Neill argues would not be used to describe a male politician. O'Neill contends that the magazine is portraying Bachmann as "a nut job" and that such attacks could deter women from running for office. Bachmann herself has declined to comment on the cover, while conservative critics like Brent Bozell have denounced the magazine's "journalistic dishonesty." The controversy highlights the ongoing struggle for fair and respectful media representation of women in politics.
