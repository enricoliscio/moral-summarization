SUMMARY:

The National Organization for Women (NOW) has condemned Newsweek's latest cover story on Rep. Michele Bachmann, labeling it "sexist" and "misogynistic". The magazine's depiction of Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage" with an unflattering photo is seen as an attack on her character, implying she's unstable and unfit for office. NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the magazine would not treat a male candidate similarly, and that such attacks could deter women from running for office. Even those who disagree with Bachmann's politics, like O'Neill, are standing up for her against this kind of sexism. Others, like Brent Bozell, see this as part of a larger pattern of journalistic dishonesty by liberal media outlets against conservatives. The incident raises important questions about media bias and its impact on women in politics.
