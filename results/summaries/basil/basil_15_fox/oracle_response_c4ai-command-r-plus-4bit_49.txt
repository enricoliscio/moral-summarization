SUMMARY: Newsweek has come under fire for its recent cover story on Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, with critics calling the magazine "out of bounds" and "misogynistic" in its depiction of the Minnesota congresswoman. The cover, titled "The Queen of Rage," features an unflattering photo of Bachmann and has been criticized by the National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill as "sexist." O'Neill argues that the magazine is casting Bachmann as a "nut job," and that they would not have done the same to a male candidate. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, also condemned the magazine's "journalistic dishonesty," stating that conservatives should steer clear of such venues or demand editorial oversight. Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, but others have defended her, arguing that such misogynistic attacks could deter women from running for office.
END OF SUMMARY.
