SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has drawn criticism for her recent Newsweek cover, which features an unflattering photo and the headline "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has called the cover "sexist," arguing that the magazine is casting Bachmann as a "nut job" and that they would not do the same to a male candidate. Others, such as Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, have also criticized the magazine for its treatment of conservatives. Bachmann herself has not commented on the cover, simply stating that she had not seen it. NOW President Terry O'Neill defended Bachmann, stating that they want to encourage women to run for office and that "good women will not run for office" if they are subjected to such treatment. The magazine has defended the photo, claiming that several of the images taken of Bachmann appeared similar, and has posted other, more flattering photos of her on their website.
END OF SUMMARY.
