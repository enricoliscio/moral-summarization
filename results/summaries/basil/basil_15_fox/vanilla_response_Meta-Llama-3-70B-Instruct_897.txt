SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann, a presidential candidate, has been featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine with an unflattering photo and the title "The Queen of Rage". The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized the cover, calling it "sexist" and claiming it would not be used for a male candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill argued that the title is demeaning and would not be used for a man. Bachmann herself has declined to comment on the cover. Defenders of Bachmann, including NOW, argue that the cover is an example of misogynistic attacks that could discourage women from running for office. Critics of the magazine, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, claim that Newsweek has a history of biased and dishonest reporting, particularly against conservatives.
