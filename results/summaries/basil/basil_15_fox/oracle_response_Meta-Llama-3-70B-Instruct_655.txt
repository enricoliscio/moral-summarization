SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has refused to engage with Newsweek over its controversial cover story, which has been labeled "sexist" by the National Organization for Women (NOW). The magazine's depiction of Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage" is seen as a misogynistic attack, with NOW President Terry O'Neill arguing that the same treatment would not be given to a male candidate. O'Neill called out the magazine's "dishonesty" and emphasized the importance of defending women in politics, even if they disagree on issues. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, condemned the cover as "journalistic dishonesty" and advised conservatives to steer clear of such biased publications. The controversy highlights the need for editorial "oversight" to prevent such attacks on women in politics. Bachmann herself has remained calm, saying she will "take a look" at the cover. The incident raises concerns about the treatment of women in politics and the media's role in perpetuating sexism.
