Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user mentioned that I should preserve the author's moral perspective. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." The cover has an unflattering photo. Bachmann didn't comment, but others criticized the magazine. Terry O'Neill from NOW called it sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test—would they call a man "The King of Rage?" She argues that the title is dehumanizing, comparing it to wrestlers or crazy people. Newsweek defended the photo, saying it's part of a series, some of which are flattering. Bachmann said she hadn't seen the cover. O'Neill supports Bachmann despite disagreeing with her policies because they want more women in politics. Bozell from the Media Research Center criticized Newsweek for bias against conservatives, suggesting they can't be trusted.

Now, I need to capture the moral issues here. The main points are sexism in media portrayal, the impact on women running for office, and media bias. I should highlight how the cover is seen as sexist and the implications for female politicians. Also, mention Bachmann's response and the defense from NOW and Bozell's criticism of Newsweek.

I should structure the summary to include these elements concisely, under 200 words. Make sure to mention the criticism of Newsweek, the sexist angle, Bachmann's lack of comment, and the broader implications for women in politics. Also, include Bozell's point about media bias. 

Let me start drafting: Newsweek's cover on Bachmann as "Queen of Rage" sparked criticism for sexism. NOW argues it's dehumanizing and unfair, using the test of whether it would apply to a man. Bachmann didn't comment but was campaigning. Newsweek defended the photo as part of a series. NOW supports Bachmann to encourage women in politics. Bozell criticized Newsweek's bias against conservatives. So, the summary should cover these points, emphasizing the moral issues of sexism and media bias.
