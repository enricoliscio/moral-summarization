SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has been the subject of sexist and misogynistic attacks by Newsweek magazine, which featured an unflattering photo of her on its cover alongside the headline "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill criticized the magazine for its depiction of Bachmann, arguing that such attacks discourage women from running for office. O'Neill and others have called out Newsweek for its dishonesty and lack of oversight in portraying Bachmann as a "nut job." While Bachmann has chosen not to engage with the magazine, others, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, have spoken out against the unfair treatment she has received.
END OF SUMMARY.
