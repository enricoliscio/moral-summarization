Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. Rep. Michele Bachmann didn't engage with Newsweek over their "Queen of Rage" cover, but others are criticizing it. Terry O'Neill from NOW called it sexist, using Gloria Steinem's testâ€”would they do this to a man? She argues that Newsweek is portraying Bachmann as a nutjob, which is unfair. Newsweek defended the photo, saying other images were similar and some were flattering. Bachmann said she hadn't seen the cover but would check. O'Neill supports Bachmann despite disagreeing with her policies, wanting more women in politics. Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center called it journalistic dishonesty and urged conservatives to avoid such outlets.

I need to include the morally framed words: depiction, sexist, referred, misogynistic, attacks, defeat, sheer, dishonesty, oversight. I should keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: mention Bachmann's response, NOW's criticism as sexist and misogynistic, their reasoning, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's reaction, O'Neill's stance, and Bozell's comments on dishonesty and oversight.

I should make sure to include all the key points and the moral terms without making it too long. Let me check the word count as I go. I'll start with Bachmann declining to respond, then NOW's criticism, their test, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's comment, O'Neill's support, and Bozell's take. That should cover all points concisely.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not responded to Newsweek's "Queen of Rage" cover, but critics argue the depiction is sexist and misogynistic. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the magazine, using Gloria Steinem's test: would they call a man "The King of Rage"? O'Neill accused Newsweek of unfairly casting Bachmann as a "nut job," while the magazine defended the photo, noting other images were similar and some were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but would review it. O'Neill, though opposing Bachmann's policies, supports her against such attacks, fearing they discourage women from running for office. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center called the coverage journalistically dishonest and urged conservatives to avoid such outlets or demand oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
