SUMMARY:
Rep. Michele Bachmann has been depicted as "The Queen of Rage" on the cover of Newsweek magazine, accompanied by an unflattering photo. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill has called the cover "sexist" and claims it is a "misogynistic attack" on Bachmann. O'Neill argues that the magazine would not use the same language to describe a male politician, citing a test by Gloria Steinem. Bachmann has declined to comment on the cover, while NOW and other conservative groups have come to her defense, calling out Newsweek for "journalistic dishonesty". The magazine has defended the photo, saying it is one of several taken of Bachmann. The controversy has sparked debate about the media's treatment of female politicians and the potential impact on women's willingness to run for office. END OF SUMMARY.
