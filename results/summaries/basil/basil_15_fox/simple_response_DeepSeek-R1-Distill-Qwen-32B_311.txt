Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rep. Michele Bachmann and the Newsweek cover story that's being criticized for sexism.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main issue is the cover calling her "The Queen of Rage" with an unflattering photo. Critics, like Terry O'Neill, argue it's sexist because such terms aren't applied to male candidates. They mention Gloria Steinem's test about how men wouldn't be labeled similarly.

Newsweek defends the photo, saying other images were similar and some were flattering. Bachmann didn't comment on it directly. The National Organization for Women supports her, even though they oppose her policies, to encourage more women in politics. They worry that such attacks discourage women from running.

Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center criticizes the magazine for bias against conservatives. The summary needs to capture the moral arguments about sexism and bias, and the defense from Newsweek.

I should structure the summary to include the criticism, the defense, and the reasons behind the support for Bachmann. Keep it under 200 words, focus on the moral aspects, and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story labeling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's portrayal is sexist. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, noting that such language is rarely applied to male politicians. O'Neill emphasized that Newsweek, a prominent publication, is casting Bachmann as a "nut job," which she claims is misogynistic and discourages women from running for office. Newsweek defended the photo, stating it was part of a series and that other images of Bachmann were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover but acknowledged the story. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center accused Newsweek and Time of bias against conservatives, calling their approach "journalistic dishonesty." The争议 highlights concerns about media bias and its impact on women in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
