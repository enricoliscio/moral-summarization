SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann, a presidential candidate, has been featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine with an unflattering photo and the title "The Queen of Rage". The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized the cover as "sexist", arguing that a similar depiction would not be used for a male candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill stated that the magazine's portrayal of Bachmann as "crazy" could deter women from running for office. Bachmann herself declined to comment on the cover, saying she had not seen it. Others, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, have also criticized the magazine's depiction of Bachmann, calling it "journalistic dishonesty". The controversy has sparked debate about the media's treatment of female politicians and the potential impact on women's participation in politics.
