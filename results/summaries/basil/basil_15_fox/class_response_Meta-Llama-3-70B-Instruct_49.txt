SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to comment on Newsweek's cover story, which features an unflattering photo of her and labels her "The Queen of Rage". The National Organization for Women (NOW) has called out the magazine for its sexist depiction of Bachmann, citing a simple test by founder Gloria Steinem: would the magazine do the same to a man? NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the cover is a misogynistic attack, implying that Bachmann is a "nut job" and not a serious contender for president. O'Neill defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on most issues, because she wants to encourage women to run for office without fear of such attacks. Others, like Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, condemn the magazine's sheer journalistic dishonesty and advise conservatives to steer clear of such biased publications. The controversy highlights the need for editorial oversight to prevent such attacks.
