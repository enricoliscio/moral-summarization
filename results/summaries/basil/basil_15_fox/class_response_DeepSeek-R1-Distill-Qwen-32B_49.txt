Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they probably want an accurate summary that reflects the original article's tone and the author's moral perspective.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. It's about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage." The article mentions that Bachmann didn't comment, but others criticized the magazine. Terry O'Neill from NOW called it sexist and used a test by Gloria Steinem, pointing out that men aren't labeled similarly. She also mentioned that Newsweek's portrayal could discourage women from running for office, even though they oppose Bachmann.

Newsweek defended the photo, saying it was just one of several taken. Bachmann said she hadn't seen the cover but would look into it. Brent Bozell criticized the magazine for bias against conservatives, calling it dishonest.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words like depiction, sexist, misogynistic, attacks, defeat, dishonesty, and oversight. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I'll start by stating the main issue: Bachmann's criticism of Newsweek's cover. Then, mention O'Neill's points about sexism and the impact on women in politics. Include Bachmann's response and Newsweek's defense. Finally, add Bozell's criticism about media bias and dishonesty.

I should make sure each point flows logically, keeping the moral implications front and center. Also, I'll ensure the summary doesn't add any new information beyond what's in the article and sticks to the key points.

Let me put it all together, making sure to include all the necessary moral terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll check for clarity and that all important aspects are covered without being too verbose.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Michele Bachmann has faced criticism over Newsweek's cover story, "The Queen of Rage," which some argue perpetuates a sexist depiction of her. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women called the cover "sexist," referencing Gloria Steinem's test: would a man be labeled "The King of Rage"? O'Neill argued the magazine is casting Bachmann as a "nut job," a label more suited for wrestlers or the mentally unstable, and criticized the media for failing to apply the same scrutiny to male politicians. Newsweek defended the photo, stating it was part of a series and that other images of Bachmann were flattering. Bachmann herself declined to comment on the cover when asked. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center accused Newsweek of "sheer journalistic dishonesty," arguing conservative politicians are often targeted by such outlets. O'Neill emphasized the need to defend Bachmann against "misogynistic attacks" to encourage more women to run for office, even as she aims to "defeat" Bachmann politically. END OF SUMMARY.
