Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story titled "The Queen of Rage." The cover has an unflattering photo, and there's criticism from Terry O'Neill of NOW, who calls it sexist. She uses Gloria Steinem's test to question if a man would be treated the same way. O'Neill argues that such coverage discourages women from running for office. Newsweek defended the photo, saying it's just one of many images taken and that others are flattering. Bachmann hasn't seen the cover yet. Others, like Brent Bozell, criticize Newsweek for bias against conservatives.

I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by mentioning Bachmann's refusal to comment, the criticism from NOW, the sexist claim, the example with Howard Dean, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's response, and the broader implications. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without too much detail.

I should structure it so it flows logically: introduce the issue, mention the criticism, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's reaction, and the implications for women in politics. Make sure to include that the National Organization for Women is supporting Bachmann despite opposing her policies because they don't want sexist media practices to deter women candidates.

I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Rep. Michele Bachmann has not responded to Newsweek's cover story calling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the magazine's portrayal is sexist. National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill criticized the cover, using Gloria Steinem's test to question whether a man would be labeled similarly. O'Neill defended Bachmann, a serious presidential contender, against what she called misogynistic attacks, emphasizing the importance of supporting women in politics. Newsweek defended the photo, stating it was one of several taken and that other images were flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she hadn't seen the cover. Critics like Brent Bozell accused Newsweek of bias against conservatives, urging them to avoid such outlets. END OF SUMMARY.
