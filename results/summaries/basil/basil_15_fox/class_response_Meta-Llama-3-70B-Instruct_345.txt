SUMMARY:

Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to comment on Newsweek's cover story, which features an unflattering photo of her and labels her "The Queen of Rage." The National Organization for Women (NOW) has called out the magazine for its sexist depiction, citing a test by founder Gloria Steinem: would they do the same to a man? NOW President Terry O'Neill argues that the label is misogynistic and reduces Bachmann to a "nut job." O'Neill defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on most issues, because she wants to encourage women to run for office. Media Research Center head Brent Bozell also condemns the cover, calling it "sheer journalistic dishonesty" and advising conservatives to avoid such venues or demand editorial oversight. Newsweek has defended the photo, claiming that several images of Bachmann appeared similar. The controversy highlights the importance of fair and respectful depiction of political candidates, particularly women.
