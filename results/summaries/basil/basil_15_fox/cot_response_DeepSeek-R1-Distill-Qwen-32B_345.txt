Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article, then write a concise summary that includes those words.

First, I'll read through the article to get a sense of the main points. It's about Rep. Michele Bachmann and a Newsweek cover story that's been criticized for being sexist and unfair. The National Organization for Women (NOW) is calling out Newsweek for using terms like "Queen of Rage," which they argue would not be applied to a male candidate. They're concerned that such treatment discourages women from running for office. On the other hand, Newsweek defended their photo choice, and some conservative media outlets are criticizing the magazine's bias against conservatives.

Now, for the first step, identifying the morally framed words. I need to look for words that carry strong ethical or evaluative connotations. Words like "sexist," "nut job," "misogynistic," "dishonesty," and "unfair" come to mind. These terms are used to criticize the magazine's actions, highlighting the moral issue of gender bias in media portrayal.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be concise but comprehensive. I'll start by mentioning Bachmann's reaction, then the criticism from NOW, their argument about gender bias, the defense from Newsweek, and the conservative perspective on media bias.

I should ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use the identified words where appropriate. I'll also make sure to include the key points: the cover story's title, the criticism of sexism, the comparison to male politicians, Newsweek's defense, and the broader implications for women in politics.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Bachmann's decline to engage, then the criticism from NOW, their argument, Newsweek's defense, Bachmann's campaign, the support from NOW despite disagreements, and the conservative media's take on bias.

I need to keep the language clear and direct, making sure each sentence flows logically to the next. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.

Double-checking to ensure all morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding any personal opinions. The focus should be on the moral critique of the media's handling of Bachmann's image and the implications for gender representation in politics.

Alright, I think I've got a good structure for the summary. Now, I'll put it all together, making sure it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

**STEP 1:**  
* Sexist  
* Nut job  
* Misogynistic  
* Dishonesty  
* Unfair  

**SUMMARY:**  
Rep. Michele Bachmann has not directly responded to Newsweek's cover story labeling her "The Queen of Rage," but critics argue the portrayal is sexist and unfair. Terry O'Neill of the National Organization for Women (NOW) criticized the magazine for using language that would not be applied to a male candidate, calling it misogynistic and casting Bachmann as a "nut job." Newsweek defended its photo choice, stating it was consistent with other images of Bachmann, some of which are flattering. Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa, said she had not seen the cover but acknowledged the story. O'Neill, while opposing Bachmann politically, defended her against such attacks, arguing that such treatment discourages women from running for office. Conservative media critic Brent Bozell accused Newsweek of journalistic dishonesty and bias against conservatives, urging them to avoid such outlets. END OF SUMMARY.
