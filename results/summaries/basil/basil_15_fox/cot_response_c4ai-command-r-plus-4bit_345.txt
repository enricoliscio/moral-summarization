SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has come under fire for its cover story on presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage," which featured an unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican. The National Organization for Women (NOW) president Terry O'Neill called the cover "sexist" and "misogynistic," arguing that the magazine would not have treated a male candidate in the same way. O'Neill defended Bachmann, despite their political differences, stating that such attacks discourage women from running for office. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, agreed that the cover was out of bounds and accused Newsweek of journalistic dishonesty, urging conservatives to steer away from the magazine or demand editorial oversight. While Newsweek defended the photo, the incident has sparked a debate about the moral implications of media portrayal and its potential impact on women's political participation. END OF SUMMARY.
