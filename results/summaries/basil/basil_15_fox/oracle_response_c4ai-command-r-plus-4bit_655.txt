SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover story on presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann has sparked accusations of sexism and misogyny. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill criticized the magazine for its depiction of Bachmann as "The Queen of Rage," arguing that such a characterization would never be applied to a male candidate. O'Neill and others, including Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, denounced the cover as an unfair and dishonest attack on a prominent female politician, suggesting that it could deter other women from running for office. While Newsweek defended the photo choice, claiming similar photos were taken, Bachmann herself chose not to engage in the controversy. This incident highlights concerns about sexist and dishonest media portrayals of conservative women in politics, with calls for greater editorial oversight to prevent such incidents in the future.
