Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump choosing an interim FBI Director. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by saying Trump is close to selecting an interim candidate to replace James Comey. He told reporters that Joe Lieberman is his top choice. Lieberman is a former senator and a centrist Democrat. He doesn't have federal law enforcement experience, which is a point of contention. Some Democrats are against this choice, saying the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. They mention that Lieberman's background is in politics, not law enforcement, and that it's unusual for the Senate not to back the choice fully. Some senators, like Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, are critical, while others like Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse also oppose it.

On the other hand, Republicans support Lieberman. Rubio, Cornyn, and McCain are mentioned as praising him, with McCain saying he has more experience than all Democratic colleagues combined. The need for a new director came after Trump fired Comey, which was during the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. There have been reports suggesting Trump interfered with the investigation, including a New York Times report about Trump asking Comey to stop an investigation into Michael Flynn.

So, the main points are:
- Trump is choosing Lieberman as interim FBI Director.
- Lieberman has no law enforcement experience, which is a concern for Democrats.
- Republicans support him, highlighting his political experience.
- The move comes after Comey's firing during an ongoing Russia investigation, with allegations of interference.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words. I should mention Trump's selection of Lieberman, the criticism from Democrats about his lack of law enforcement background, Republican support, and the context of Comey's firing and the Russia investigation.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Trump is close to selecting Lieberman as interim FBI Director.
2. Lieberman lacks federal law enforcement experience, causing Democratic concern.
3. Democrats argue the FBI director should be from law enforcement, not politics.
4. Republicans praise Lieberman, noting his experience and potential for confirmation.
5. The decision follows Comey's firing during the Russia investigation, with reports of possible interference.

Now, I'll make sure the summary is concise and includes all these points without exceeding 200 words.

Republicans, however, praise Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain highlighting his political experience. The decision follows Trump's firing of James Comey amid the FBI's Russia investigation, with reports suggesting potential interference. END OF SUMMARY.
