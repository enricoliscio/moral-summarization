Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: "contrary," "undermines," and "interfered." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI Director, likely Joe Lieberman. Lieberman is a politician with no law enforcement experience, which has caused concern among Democrats. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, which they see as contrary to the agency's mission. This choice could undermine public confidence in the FBI's independence. Additionally, Trump's firing of Comey and the reports of interference in the Russia investigation add to the controversy.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral terms. I'll structure the summary to highlight the main points: Trump's selection of Lieberman, the Democratic opposition, the Republican support, and the context of the Russia investigation. I'll use "contrary," "undermines," and "interfered" appropriately to maintain the moral framing.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and captures all key elements without going into too much detail. I'll avoid any markdown and present it as a natural summary after the "SUMMARY:" token.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator and politician without federal law enforcement experience, has drawn severe criticism from Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician to lead the FBI is "contrary" to the agency's mission and would "undermine" public confidence in its independence. Democrats, including Sen. Claire McCaskill and Sen. Brian Schatz, oppose the choice, while Republicans, like Sen. John McCain, praise Lieberman. The decision comes amid heightened scrutiny over Trump's handling of the FBI's Russia investigation, with reports suggesting Trump may have "interfered" in the probe. END OF SUMMARY.
