Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's potential choice for the interim FBI Director. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that Trump is close to selecting an interim candidate to replace James Comey. He mentioned Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman is a former senator and a centrist Democrat. Interesting, since he doesn't have law enforcement experience.

Next, the article talks about the candidates Trump met with, including Andrew McCabe, Frank Keating, and Richard McFeely. Lieberman stands out because he's a politician without law enforcement background, which is causing concern among Democrats. They argue that the FBI director should come from law enforcement, not politics.

Democrats like Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz are criticizing the choice, saying it undermines the FBI's independence. They also note that it's rare to appoint an FBI director without Senate backing. A Democratic aide called it a bad move, especially given the current context with the Russia investigation.

On the other hand, Republicans are supportive. Rubio, Cornyn, and McCain praise Lieberman, with McCain dismissing Democratic concerns. The article mentions that Trump fired Comey amid an investigation into Trump's campaign ties with Russia, adding to the tension.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. I'll start by stating Trump is close to selecting Lieberman. Then mention Lieberman's background and the criticism from Democrats. Highlight the political versus law enforcement debate. Also, include Republican support and the context of Comey's firing and the Russia investigation.

Let me structure it: Introduction about Trump's choice, Lieberman's background, criticism from Democrats, support from Republicans, and the context of the Russia probe.

I should ensure the summary is concise, hitting all key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the political vs law enforcement divide and the implications for the FBI's independence.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, keeping it under 200 words.
