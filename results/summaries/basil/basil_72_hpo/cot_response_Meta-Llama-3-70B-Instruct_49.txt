SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, calling it a "mistake" to select an elected official to the post. Sen. Brian Schatz described the possible nomination as "shocking," arguing that it is "contrary" to everything the FBI is about and would "undermine" the public's confidence in the agency's independence. Many Democrats agree that a politician should not head the FBI, with Sen. Dick Durbin stating that the director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement, not politicians. In contrast, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump's controversial decision to fire James Comey, which has sparked concerns about interference with the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
