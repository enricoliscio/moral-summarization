SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, citing that Lieberman's background in politics would be "contrary to everything the FBI is about" and would "undermine the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency." Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination "shocking," emphasizing that there are dozens of qualified individuals who could get a unanimous vote. Trump's decision to consider a politician for the role has sparked concerns about the agency's independence, particularly given the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump's actions have already raised questions about interference, with reports suggesting he asked former FBI Director James Comey to shut down a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials. The nomination of Lieberman would only exacerbate these concerns.
