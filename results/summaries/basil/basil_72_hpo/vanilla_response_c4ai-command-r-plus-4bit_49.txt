SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is reportedly very close to selecting an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, stating that his top choice is former Sen. Joe Lieberman. This decision has sparked mixed reactions among Democrats and Republicans. Some Democrats, such as Sen. Claire McCaskill and Sen. Brian Schatz, have expressed strong opposition to the choice, arguing that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official and not a politician. They also highlight the potential conflict of interest due to Lieberman's association with a law firm connected to the president's legal team. On the other hand, Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. John Cornyn, and Sen. John McCain have praised Lieberman, with McCain going as far as to say he would be "overjoyed" with the pick. The debate over Lieberman's potential nomination comes amid ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia and the recent firing of Comey, which has raised concerns about possible interference in the investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
