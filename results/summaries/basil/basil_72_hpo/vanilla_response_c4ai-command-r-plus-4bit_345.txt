SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is reportedly close to selecting an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Senator Joe Lieberman as the top choice. Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience and is associated with the Democratic Party, which has caused severe reservations among Democrats. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official and not a politician. Some Democratic senators, including Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, have expressed strong opposition to Lieberman's possible nomination. On the other hand, Republican senators like Marco Rubio, John Cornyn, and John McCain have praised Lieberman, with McCain going so far as to say he would be "overjoyed" with the selection. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired Comey last week amidst the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. Reports have suggested that Trump may have interfered with the investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
