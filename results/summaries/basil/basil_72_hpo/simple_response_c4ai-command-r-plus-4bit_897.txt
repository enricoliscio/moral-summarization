SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice for interim FBI Director, despite opposition from Democrats who argue that the position should be filled by a law enforcement official with no political affiliation. Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience but is a close associate of Trump's top lawyer. His possible nomination has sparked moral concerns among Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician to head the FBI would undermine the independence of the agency and could split the Senate. Despite this, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain expressing his support for the former senator. The consideration of Lieberman as FBI Director comes amid ethical concerns surrounding Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
