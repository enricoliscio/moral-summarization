Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump selecting an interim FBI Director to replace James Comey. He's considering Joe Lieberman, a former senator, which is unusual because Lieberman doesn't have law enforcement experience. Democrats are against this choice, arguing that the FBI director should come from law enforcement, not politics. They worry it undermines the FBI's independence, especially since Trump fired Comey during an investigation into Russian ties. Republicans, however, support Lieberman, praising his experience. The article also mentions the context of the Russia investigation and the concerns about political interference.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, ending with the specified tokens. I need to make sure to include the key points: Trump's choice of Lieberman, the criticism from Democrats, support from Republicans, the context of Comey's firing, and the implications for the FBI's independence.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Trump's decision, then the reactions from both parties, and the broader context of the Russia investigation. I'll need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main arguments without getting too detailed.

Let me start drafting: Trump is close to choosing Lieberman as interim FBI Director. Democrats oppose because he's a politician without law enforcement background, fearing it affects FBI's independence. Republicans support him, citing his experience. The choice comes after Comey's firing during the Russia investigation, raising concerns about political interference.

Wait, that's a bit too short. I should add more details about the reactions. Maybe mention that Democrats think it's a mistake and Republicans think he's qualified. Also, note the context of the investigation and the potential for undermining public trust.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and captures the moral framing from both sides.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat without federal law enforcement experience, has faced criticism from Democrats who argue the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official, not a politician. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz warned it would undermine public confidence in the FBI's independence. Democrats expressed strong opposition, deeming Lieberman a poor choice. Republicans, however, praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain asserting he has more experience than all Democratic colleagues combined. The need for a new director arose after Trump fired Comey amid the FBI's investigation into Russian ties with Trump's campaign. Critics fear the move could signal political interference in the ongoing probe. END OF SUMMARY.
