SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has sparked severe reservation among Democrats. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, and that Lieberman's nomination would undermine the agency's independence. Democrats, including Sens. Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, have expressed strong opposition to the pick, citing the need for a non-partisan leader. In contrast, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were selected. The controversy comes amid ongoing investigations into Trump's ties to Russia, which have raised concerns about the president's interference with the probe. The nomination of a politician like Lieberman has sparked moral outrage, with many arguing that it would compromise the integrity of the FBI.
