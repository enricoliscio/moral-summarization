SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice for interim FBI director, a move that has sparked severe reservations among Democrats. They argue that appointing a politician to head the FBI is "contrary" to the nature of the agency and "undermines" public confidence in its independence. Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination "shocking," emphasizing that there are many qualified non-political candidates for the role. This sentiment was echoed by other Democratic senators, who expressed strong opposition to the idea of a politician leading the FBI. Meanwhile, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain dismissing Democratic concerns. The consideration of Lieberman as FBI director comes amid ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia and reports that Trump interfered with the probes, asking former FBI Director James Comey to shut down an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials.
