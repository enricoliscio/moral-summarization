SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice to replace former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump last week. The decision has sparked mixed reactions from Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. While some Republicans praised Lieberman, Democrats expressed severe reservation about selecting an elected official with no federal law enforcement experience for the role. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a “mistake,” while Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination “shocking.” Some Democrats also highlighted the potential for immense opposition to the pick, given the ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Meanwhile, Republicans such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. John Cornyn praised Lieberman, with Cornyn speculating that he could receive 100 confirmation votes. The need for a new FBI director comes as explosive reports suggest that Trump interfered with the FBI's investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
