SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is close to choosing an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked moral concerns and strong reactions from both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats, such as Sens. Claire McCaskill, Brian Schatz, Dick Durbin, and Sheldon Whitehouse, find Lieberman's potential nomination **shocking**, calling it a **mistake** to select an elected official with no federal law enforcement experience. They argue that it is an **unprecedented** and **terrible** choice, emphasizing the importance of the FBI director being a career law enforcement official. Meanwhile, Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio and John Cornyn have praised Lieberman, with Cornyn suggesting he could receive overwhelming confirmation votes. The FBI director position has become vacant after Trump fired Comey amid the Russia investigation. The decision to fire Comey and potentially appoint Lieberman has raised questions about the independence of the FBI and the administration's ties to Russia. Sen. John McCain, however, had a strong message for Democrats, saying, "**screw** them." END OF SUMMARY.
