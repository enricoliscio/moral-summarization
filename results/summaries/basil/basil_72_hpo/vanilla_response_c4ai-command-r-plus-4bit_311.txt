SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, who was fired last week. Trump's top choice is former Senator Joe Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience. Democrats have expressed severe reservation about Lieberman's possible nomination, arguing that the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official. Republicans, however, have praised Lieberman, with some speculating that he could receive widespread confirmation support in the Senate. The need for a new FBI director comes amid an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and reports that Trump interfered with the investigation. The selection of Lieberman, a politician, as FBI director is an unconventional and controversial choice, with some Democrats calling it a "mistake."
