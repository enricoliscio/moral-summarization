SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice to replace former FBI Director James Comey, a move that has sparked severe reservations among Democrats. They argue that appointing a politician to head the FBI is contrary to the agency's nature and undermines public confidence in its independence. Senators Claire McCaskill, Brian Schatz, Dick Durbin, and Sheldon Whitehouse have all expressed opposition to the idea of a politician leading the FBI, emphasizing that the director should have a background in law enforcement. Meanwhile, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain going as far as to say he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The consideration of Lieberman as a potential FBI director comes amid an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and reports that Trump interfered with the investigation by asking Comey to shut down a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials.
