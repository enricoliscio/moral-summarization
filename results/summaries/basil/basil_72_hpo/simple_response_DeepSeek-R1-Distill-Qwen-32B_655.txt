Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump choosing an interim FBI Director after firing James Comey. He's considering Joe Lieberman, a former senator, which is unusual because Lieberman has no law enforcement experience. Democrats are upset because they think the FBI director should come from law enforcement, not politics. They worry this move undermines the FBI's independence. Republicans, on the other hand, support Lieberman, saying he's qualified.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. So I need to highlight the key points: Trump's choice, the unusual nature of Lieberman's background, the Democratic opposition based on the importance of the FBI's independence, and Republican support.

I should structure the summary to first state Trump's action, then introduce Lieberman, explain the Democrats' concerns, and mention the Republicans' support. I need to keep it concise and include the moral aspects, like the potential impact on the FBI's independence and the political implications.

Let me draft that, making sure to stay under 200 words and include all necessary elements without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat without federal law enforcement experience, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who argue the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official. Sen. Claire McCaskill called the choice a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz deemed it "shocking," emphasizing the need for public confidence in the FBI's independence. A Democratic aide described the nomination as "the worst time" to appoint a politician to the role. Meanwhile, Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, praised Lieberman's qualifications, with McCain dismissing Democratic concerns. The decision comes amid heightened scrutiny of Trump's handling of the FBI's Russia investigation, following reports of potential interference. END OF SUMMARY.
