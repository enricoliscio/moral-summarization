SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is nearing a decision on an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, who he fired last week amid an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump's top choice is former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a centrist Democrat and close friend of Sen. John McCain. However, Democrats have severely criticized the potential nomination, calling it a "mistake" and an "unprecedented" step to appoint a politician to head the FBI. They argue that the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official. In contrast, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. Marco Rubio expressing "great admiration" and Sen. John Cornyn predicting a smooth confirmation process. The nomination of Lieberman, who has no federal law enforcement experience, comes at a sensitive time as new *explosive* reports suggest Trump *interfered* with the Russia investigation by asking Comey to *shut down* a separate *probe* into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's *contacts* with Russian officials.
