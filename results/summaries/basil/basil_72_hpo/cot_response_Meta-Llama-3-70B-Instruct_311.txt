SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats have reacted with severe reservation, calling it a "mistake" to select an elected official to the post. Sen. Brian Schatz deemed the possible nomination "shocking," arguing that it's "contrary" to the FBI's independence and would "undermine" public confidence. Democrats believe the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. In contrast, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, a move that has raised concerns about Trump's interference with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
