SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats have reacted with severe reservation, calling it a "mistake" to select an elected official to the post. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) described the possible nomination as "shocking," arguing that it is "contrary" to everything the FBI is about and would "undermine" public confidence in the agency's independence. Many Democrats, including Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), believe the FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement, not politicians. In contrast, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, a move that has sparked concerns about Trump's interference with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
