SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is nearing a decision on an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked moral concerns and reservations among Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician to head the FBI "undermines" the public's confidence in the agency's independence. Sen. Claire McCaskill asserted that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not an elected official. Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination "shocking" and "contrary" to the nature of the FBI. A Senate Democratic aide also emphasized the problematic timing of appointing a politician to lead the FBI, given the ongoing investigations into potential ties between Trump's administration and Russia. Meanwhile, Republicans expressed admiration for Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain dismissing Democratic concerns. This comes amidst moral scrutiny over Trump's firing of Comey and reports suggesting Trump interfered with the FBI's investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
