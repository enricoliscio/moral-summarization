SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice for interim FBI Director, despite criticism from Democrats who argue that the position should be filled by a law enforcement official with no political ties. Lieberman has no federal law enforcement experience and is associated with a centrist Democrat, raising concerns about the independence of the FBI. Some Democratic senators, such as Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, strongly opposed Lieberman's nomination, arguing that it undermines the public's confidence in the agency. Meanwhile, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. Marco Rubio expressing "great admiration" and Sen. John Cornyn speculating that he could receive widespread confirmation support. The need for a new FBI director arises after Trump fired James Comey last week, amid the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. This has led to concerns about Trump's interference in the investigation, as reported by The New York Times.
