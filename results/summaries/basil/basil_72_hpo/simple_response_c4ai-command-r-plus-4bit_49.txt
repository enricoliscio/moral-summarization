SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice to replace former FBI Director James Comey, a move that has sparked moral concerns and political opposition. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat-turned-independent with no federal law enforcement experience, has close ties to Trump's top lawyer and has expressed support for an independent commission to investigate the administration's ties to Russia. Democrats have strongly criticized the potential nomination, arguing that the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official, not a politician. They warn that appointing Lieberman would undermine public confidence in the independence of the agency and could split the Senate. Republicans, however, have praised Lieberman, with some predicting a smooth confirmation process. The consideration of Lieberman as FBI director occurs amid ethical concerns about Trump's interference in the FBI's investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia, including reports that Trump asked Comey to shut down a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials.
