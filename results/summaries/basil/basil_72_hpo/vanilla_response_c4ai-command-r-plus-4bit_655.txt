SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is close to choosing an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman has no law enforcement experience but is a centrist Democrat and has expressed support for an independent Russia investigation. Democrats have reacted with strong reservations, arguing that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. Some Democratic senators, including Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, expressed their opposition to Lieberman's nomination, while Republicans praised him. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired Comey amid the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. Reports have suggested that Trump may have interfered with the investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
