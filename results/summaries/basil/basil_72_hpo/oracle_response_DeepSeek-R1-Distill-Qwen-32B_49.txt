Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used words like "contrary," "undermines," and "interfered." I should make sure to include these words in the summary.

The article is about Trump selecting Joe Lieberman as interim FBI Director. Lieberman is a politician without law enforcement experience, which some Democrats oppose, using "contrary" and "undermines" to describe the choice. Trump fired Comey, who was investigating Russia ties, and there are reports he tried to interfere with the investigation.

I should start by stating Trump is close to selecting Lieberman. Mention Lieberman's background and why Democrats are against it, using the moral terms. Also, note the opposition from Democrats and support from Republicans. Highlight the context of Comey's firing and the interference allegations.

Need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include the moral framing words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a former senator and centrist Democrat, lacks federal law enforcement experience, drawing criticism from Democrats who argue the role should be filled by a career law enforcement official. Sen. Claire McCaskill called the choice a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz deemed it "shocking," stating it "undermines" public confidence in the FBI's independence. Democrats argue appointing a politician is "contrary" to the agency's mission, with many opposing the move. Republicans, however, praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain asserting his support. The need for a new director arose after Trump fired Comey amid the FBI's Russia investigation. Reports suggest Trump may have interfered with the probe, including asking Comey to halt an inquiry into Michael Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
