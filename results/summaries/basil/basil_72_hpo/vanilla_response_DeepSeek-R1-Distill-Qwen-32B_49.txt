Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump choosing an interim FBI director. Let me read through the article first.

So, Trump is close to picking someone to replace Comey. He mentioned Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman is a former senator and an independent now. He's from a law firm whose founder is one of Trump's lawyers. Trump met with Lieberman and three others: McCabe, Keating, and McFeely. 

Lieberman doesn't have law enforcement experience, which is making some Democrats worried. They think the FBI director should come from law enforcement, not politics. Some senators like McCaskill and Schatz are against it. Schatz said it's a bad idea because there are plenty of qualified people. 

On the other hand, Republicans like Rubio, Cornyn, and McCain support Lieberman. They think he's qualified and might get bipartisan support. 

The context is that Trump fired Comey during an investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia. There are reports suggesting Trump tried to interfere with the investigation, like asking Comey to drop the Flynn probe.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on Trump's choice of Lieberman, the political background, reactions from both parties, and the context of Comey's firing and the Russia investigation.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's decision, mention Lieberman's background, the political split, and the context of the investigation.

Make sure to include key points: Lieberman's political past, lack of law enforcement experience, Democratic concerns, Republican support, and the reason for the vacancy (Comey's firing and the Russia probe).

Also, note that Lieberman's nomination is unusual and the implications for the FBI's independence.

I think that's all. Now, put it together concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat turned independent, lacks federal law enforcement experience, sparking criticism from Democrats who argue the role should be filled by a career law enforcement official. Senate Democrats, including Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, oppose the nomination, calling it a mistake that undermines the FBI's independence. Republicans, however, praise Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain stating he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman is chosen. The need for a new director arises after Trump fired James Comey amid the FBI's investigation into ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. Comey's firing and reports of Trump's potential interference in the investigation have heightened scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
