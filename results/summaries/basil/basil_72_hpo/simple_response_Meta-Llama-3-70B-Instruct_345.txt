SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI Director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are strongly opposed to the idea, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his background in politics. They argue that the FBI Director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, and that Lieberman's nomination would undermine the agency's independence and public confidence. Senators Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz have expressed severe reservations, with Schatz calling the possible nomination "shocking" and "contrary to everything the FBI is about." Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Lieberman, with Senators Marco Rubio, John Cornyn, and John McCain expressing support for his nomination. The controversy comes amid the FBI's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, which has been marred by reports of Trump's interference.
