SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, met with Trump on Wednesday along with three other candidates. Democrats have expressed severe reservations about Lieberman's potential nomination, citing his lack of law enforcement experience and his background in politics. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Lieberman, with some predicting he could get 100 confirmation votes. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired Comey last week, amid the FBI's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
