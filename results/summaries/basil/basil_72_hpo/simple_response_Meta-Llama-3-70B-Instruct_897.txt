SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are strongly opposed to the idea of a politician leading the FBI, citing the need for independence and law enforcement experience. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake" and Sen. Brian Schatz said it would be "shocking" and "contrary to everything the FBI is about." Even a top Senate Democratic aide stated that it would be a "terrible choice." In contrast, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The controversy comes amid the ongoing investigation into Trump's campaign ties to Russia, which Trump has been accused of interfering with. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the integrity of the FBI and the justice system is at stake, and partisan politics should not be allowed to compromise it.
