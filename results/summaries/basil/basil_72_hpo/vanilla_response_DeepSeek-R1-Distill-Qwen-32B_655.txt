Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the interim FBI Director. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Trump is close to selecting an interim candidate after firing James Comey. He mentioned Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman is a former senator and has no federal law enforcement experience, which is a bit unusual. He's a centrist Democrat and supports an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump's administration and Russia. This choice is causing reactions from both parties.

Democrats are against it, with some like Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz saying it's a mistake because the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. They argue it undermines public confidence and that there are plenty of qualified candidates. Senate Democrats are opposed, and even some top aides are blunt about their opposition.

On the other hand, Republicans are supportive. Rubio, Cornyn, and McCain praise Lieberman, with McCain even saying he'd be "overjoyed" if Lieberman is chosen. The context is that Trump fired Comey amid the Russia investigation, which has led to concerns about interference.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's choice of Lieberman, the reasons behind it, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, and the context of Comey's firing and the Russia investigation.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump considering Lieberman, mention Lieberman's background, the political reactions, and the context of the investigation. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and ends with the key point about the investigation and interference concerns.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat without federal law enforcement experience, has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. Senate Democrats oppose the nomination, deeming it a mistake and a blow to public confidence in the agency's independence. Republicans, however, support Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain calling him highly qualified. The need for a new director arises after Trump fired James Comey amid the FBI's investigation into ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. Critics fear this move could heighten concerns of political interference in the ongoing probe. END OF SUMMARY.
