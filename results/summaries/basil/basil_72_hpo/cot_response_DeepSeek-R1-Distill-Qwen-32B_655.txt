Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure, so I should follow that.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "close," "top choice," "top lawyers," "unconventional," "severe reservation," "mistake," "shocking," "undermines," "independence," "qualified," "unanimous," "rare," "split," "opposition," "worse time," "unprecedented," "handing over," "terrible choice," "drawn from," "experience," "interfered," "explosive," "interfere," "interference," "stunning," "shut down," "screw them." These words seem to carry moral implications in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: Trump is close to selecting Lieberman as interim FBI director, his background, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, the context of Comey's firing, and the implications for the investigation.

I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's perspective. For example, Democrats' severe reservations, the shock of the nomination, undermining independence, and the Republicans' praise despite the opposition.

I should structure the summary to first state Trump's decision, then Lieberman's background and lack of law enforcement experience. Then, mention the Democratic opposition, their reasons, and the Republican support. Finally, tie it back to Comey's firing and the ongoing investigation, highlighting the moral implications of the decision.

I need to keep the summary clear and within the word limit, ensuring all key points are covered without going into too much detail. Also, I should use the morally framed words naturally within the summary to maintain the original article's tone.

Let me put it all together, making sure each part flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump is close to selecting Joe Lieberman as the interim FBI director, a choice that has sparked severe reservation among Democrats. Lieberman, a former senator and centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, is seen as an unconventional pick. Democrats, including Sen. Claire McCaskill and Sen. Brian Schatz, argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, as Lieberman’s nomination would undermine the agency’s independence. Schatz called the move “shocking” and questioned the need to appoint a politician to the role, emphasizing that there are dozens of qualified candidates. A Democratic aide described the decision as the “worse time” to hand the FBI over to a politician. Meanwhile, Republicans, like Sen. John McCain, praised Lieberman, claiming he has more experience than all Democratic colleagues combined. The decision comes amid heightened scrutiny of Trump’s interference in the FBI’s Russia investigation, following the firing of Comey, who documented Trump’s request to shut down a probe into Michael Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
