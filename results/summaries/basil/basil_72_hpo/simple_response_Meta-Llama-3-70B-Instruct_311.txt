SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are strongly opposed to the idea, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his background in politics. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, to maintain the agency's independence and public trust. Sen. Claire McCaskill called the potential nomination a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz deemed it "shocking" and "contrary to everything the FBI is about." Even a top Senate Democratic aide stated that there couldn't be a worse time to appoint a politician to the role. In contrast, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, amid the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
