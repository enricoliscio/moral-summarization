Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral implications.

The article is about President Trump's potential appointment of Joe Lieberman as the interim FBI Director. The main points are that Trump is considering Lieberman, who has no law enforcement experience, and this decision is causing significant political fallout. Democrats are concerned because Lieberman is a politician, which they believe undermines the FBI's independence. Republicans, on the other hand, support the choice, highlighting Lieberman's political experience.

I need to capture the moral framing here. The Democrats are emphasizing the importance of an independent, non-political FBI director, arguing that appointing a politician could erode public trust. They're worried about the FBI's impartiality, especially given the ongoing Russia investigation. Republicans, though, are framing Lieberman's political background as a strength, suggesting he's capable despite the lack of law enforcement experience.

I should make sure the summary reflects these opposing moral viewpoints. It's important to mention the concerns about the FBI's independence and the potential impact on public confidence. Also, noting that this decision comes amidst an ongoing investigation into Trump's campaign ties with Russia adds context to why this appointment is controversial.

I'll structure the summary to first state Trump's consideration of Lieberman, then outline the Democratic concerns, followed by Republican support, and conclude with the context of the Russia investigation. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while ensuring all key points are included.

Let me draft this, making sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides without taking a stance. The summary should be neutral but comprehensive, preserving the author's framing of the issue.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who argue that the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official, not a politician. Senate Democrats, including Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz, have condemned the potential nomination, warning it undermines the FBI's independence and public trust. Lieberman's background as a politician and his support for an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump's administration and Russia have further fueled Democratic opposition. Republicans, however, have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain calling him highly qualified. The decision comes amid heightened scrutiny over Trump's interference in the FBI's Russia investigation, including reports that Trump asked Comey to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
