SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has indicated that he is very close to choosing an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, with former Senator Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked controversy among Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician to head the FBI is "contrary" to the agency's nature and "undermines" the public's confidence in its independence. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake," emphasizing that the FBI director should have a background in law enforcement. Meanwhile, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain expressing his support for the potential nominee. The debate over the appointment of a new FBI director comes amid ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia and reports that Trump interfered with the probes, requesting that Comey shut down an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials.
