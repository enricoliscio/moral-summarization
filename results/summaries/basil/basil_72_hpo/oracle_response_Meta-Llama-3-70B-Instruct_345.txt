SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, citing that Lieberman's background in politics would be "contrary to everything the FBI is about" and would "undermine the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency." Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination "shocking," emphasizing that there are many other qualified individuals who could get a unanimous vote. Democrats argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, and that Lieberman's nomination would split the chamber. In contrast, Republicans have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, a move that has raised concerns about Trump's interference with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
