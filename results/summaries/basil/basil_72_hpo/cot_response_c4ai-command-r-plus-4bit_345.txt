SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is reportedly "very close" to selecting an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Senator Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked *shocking* and *unprecedented* reactions from Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician like Lieberman to head the FBI is a *mistake*. They assert that the FBI director should be a seasoned law enforcement official. A *terrible* choice, Lieberman's nomination would face *immense opposition* from Democrats, as expressed by Senators Claire McCaskill, Brian Schatz, Dick Durbin, and Sheldon Whitehouse. Republicans, however, have praised Lieberman, with Senator John McCain defending him against Democratic concerns. Trump's decision to fire Comey amid the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia has already led to a series of *stunning* and *explosive* reports, heightening the *appearance* of interference with the investigation. The decision to appoint Lieberman as interim FBI director is controversial and highlights the partisan divide in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
