SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI Director to replace James Comey. His top choice is former Sen. Joe Lieberman, who has no federal law enforcement experience. Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, citing Lieberman's background in politics as a mistake. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. Republicans, on the other hand, are praising Lieberman, with some predicting he could get 100 confirmation votes. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired Comey last week, amid the FBI's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump's decision has raised concerns about interference with the investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
