Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump choosing Joe Lieberman as the interim FBI director. But I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me read through the article again to pick up on those.

The article starts by talking about Trump being "very close" to selecting an interim candidate. That's not really a moral word, just a descriptor. Then it mentions Lieberman as the top choice. Lieberman's law firm's founder is one of Trump's top lawyers. That's more factual.

Then it says Lieberman is an unconventional choice because he has no federal law enforcement experience. "Unconventional" could have a moral connotation, implying it's a bad or unusual choice. Democrats are reacting with "severe reservation," which is a strong negative moral judgment. Senators like Claire McCaskill call it a "mistake," which is a clear moral framing, indicating disapproval. Brian Schatz calls it "shocking," another strong negative word.

He mentions that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. "Politician" here is framed negatively, suggesting it's inappropriate. Schatz also says it's "contrary to everything the FBI is about," implying a moral failing. The idea of appointing a politician is seen as undermining public confidence, which is a moral issue about trust and independence.

Democrats argue that the director should come from "career law enforcement," which is presented as the correct, moral choice. They express "opposition" and "objection," which are moral stances. The article also notes that it's rare for an FBI director to be appointed without Senate backing, which ties into the idea of proper procedure and respect for institutions.

On the other hand, Republicans praise Lieberman, using words like "great admiration" and "overjoyed," which are positive moral judgments. They argue he has "more experience" and would get "unanimous votes," framing their support as morally correct.

The article also mentions that Trump fired Comey amid an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. This is a moral issue because it involves interference in an investigation, which is seen as wrong. Comey's memo about Trump asking him to shut down a probe adds to the moral framing of potential interference and misuse of power.

So, the morally framed words I identified are: mistake, shocking, undermine, confidence, overjoyed, admire, experience, rare, objection, opposition, reservation, unconventional, split, trashed, terrible, wrong, wrong, wrong, interference, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The summary should highlight the moral arguments from both sides, the implications of the choice, and the context of the Russia investigation.

I should start by stating Trump's decision, mention Lieberman's background, the Democratic opposition, the reasons they give (like undermining confidence, splitting the Senate), and the Republican support. I should also tie in the context of Trump firing Comey and the ongoing investigation to show the moral stakes involved.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key points without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll also need to ensure that the morally framed words are naturally integrated into the summary without forcing them in.

**SUMMARY:**

President Trump is nearing the selection of Joe Lieberman as the interim FBI Director, a decision met with severe reservation by Democrats. Lieberman, a former senator and centrist Democrat, lacks federal law enforcement experience, making his choice unconventional. Democrats argue this undermines public confidence in the FBI's independence, as the director should be a career law enforcement official, not a politician. Senator Claire McCaskill called the move a "mistake," while Brian Schatz deemed it "shocking," predicting it would split the Senate. Republicans, however, praised Lieberman, with Marco Rubio expressing "great admiration" and John McCain asserting he has more experience than his Democratic colleagues.

This decision comes amid heightened scrutiny following Trump's firing of Comey, amid an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Comey's memo detailing Trump's request to halt a probe into Flynn has fueled concerns of interference. The appointment of a politician to lead the FBI is seen as a wrong move by Democrats, while Republicans argue it's a correct choice, highlighting the moral divide over the decision. END OF SUMMARY.
