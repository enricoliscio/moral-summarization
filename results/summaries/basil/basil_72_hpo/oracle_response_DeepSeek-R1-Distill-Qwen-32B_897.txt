Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep the morally framed words like "contrary," "undermines," and "interfered." 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The main issue is President Trump choosing Joe Lieberman as the interim FBI Director. The article discusses the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, the background of Lieberman, and the implications of this choice.

I should identify the morally charged parts. The Democrats are criticizing the choice because Lieberman is a politician, not a law enforcement expert. They argue that this undermines the FBI's independence. The Republicans, on the other hand, support Lieberman, highlighting his experience.

Also, the article mentions that Trump fired Comey during an investigation into Russian ties, which could imply interference. The author uses "contrary" when Democrats say it's contrary to what the FBI stands for, "undermines" confidence, and "interfered" with the investigation.

In my summary, I need to include these words to maintain the moral framing. I should structure the summary to cover Trump's decision, Lieberman's background, the opposing views from Democrats and Republicans, and the context of Comey's firing and the Russia investigation.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start by stating Trump is close to selecting Lieberman, mention Lieberman's background, then the opposing reactions, and finally the context of Comey's firing and the interference implication.

I also need to ensure that the summary is clear and captures the essence without adding extra information. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each key point is included with the moral language preserved.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI Director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician undermines the FBI's independence and contradicts its mission. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz criticized the move as "shocking," stating there are "dozens of people" better qualified. Democrats also expressed concern that Lieberman's nomination would split the Senate. Meanwhile, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain asserting he has more experience than all Democratic colleagues combined. The need for a new director arose after Trump fired James Comey amid an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Reports have suggested Trump interfered with the probe, including a memo by Comey detailing Trump's request to shut down an investigation into Michael Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
