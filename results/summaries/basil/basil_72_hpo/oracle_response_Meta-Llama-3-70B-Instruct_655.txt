SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, citing that Lieberman's background in politics would be "contrary to everything the FBI is about" and would "undermine" the public's confidence in the agency's independence. Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination "shocking," emphasizing that there are dozens of qualified individuals who could get a unanimous vote. The move comes after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey, sparking concerns that Trump "interfered" with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia. Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The nomination would require Senate confirmation, and Democrats are likely to strongly oppose it.

END OF SUMMARY.
