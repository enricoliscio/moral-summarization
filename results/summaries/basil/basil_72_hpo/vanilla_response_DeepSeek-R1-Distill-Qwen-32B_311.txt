Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump selecting an interim FBI Director after firing James Comey. He's considering Joe Lieberman, a former senator, which is unusual since Lieberman isn't from law enforcement. 

I should note that Trump met with Lieberman and three others, but Lieberman is the top choice. Democrats are against this, fearing it politicizes the FBI. They mention the need for a career law enforcement official. Republicans, however, support Lieberman, thinking he's qualified.

The article also mentions the context of the Russia investigation, which adds to the tension. Trump's decision is seen as interfering with the probe, especially since he asked Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll highlight Trump's consideration of Lieberman, the political divide, and the implications for the FBI's independence. Also, include the context of the Russia investigation to show why this is significant.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's decision, mention Lieberman's background, the reactions from both parties, and the context of the ongoing investigation. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI Director to replace James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has drawn criticism from Democrats who argue the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz criticized the move as undermining public confidence in the FBI's independence. Republicans, however, praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain asserting he has more experience than Democratic colleagues combined. The decision comes amid heightened scrutiny over Trump's potential interference in the FBI's Russia investigation, including reports that Trump asked Comey to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
