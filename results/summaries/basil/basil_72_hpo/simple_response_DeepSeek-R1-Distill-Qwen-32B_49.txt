Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about President Trump selecting an interim FBI Director after firing James Comey. He's considering Joe Lieberman, a former senator and centrist Democrat. The key points are that Lieberman has no law enforcement experience and that this choice is causing a lot of controversy. Democrats are upset because they think the FBI director should be a law enforcement professional, not a politician. They argue that this move undermines the FBI's independence. On the other hand, Republicans are supporting Lieberman, saying he's qualified and that it's a good choice.

I need to capture the moral framing here. The author seems to present this as a conflict between Democrats who value the FBI's independence and Republicans who support Lieberman despite his political background. The moral issue is about whether a politician should lead the FBI, which is supposed to be neutral. The Democrats' concern is about the integrity of the FBI, while Republicans are more about Lieberman's qualifications and political support.

So, the summary should mention Trump's consideration of Lieberman, the criticism from Democrats about his lack of law enforcement experience and the potential impact on the FBI's independence, and the support from Republicans. Also, it's important to note the context of Comey's firing and the ongoing Russia investigation, as that adds to the moral stakes.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points without getting too detailed. I should structure it to first state Trump's action, then the reactions from both sides, and the underlying moral concerns.

Let me draft that.
