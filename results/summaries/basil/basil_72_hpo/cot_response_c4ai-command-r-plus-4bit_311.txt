SUMMARY: 
President Donald Trump is considering former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice to replace former FBI Director James Comey, a decision that has sparked moral concerns and political debates. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake", arguing that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not an elected official like Lieberman. Sen. Brian Schatz found the possible nomination *shocking*, stating that appointing a politician undermines the independence of the agency and the public's confidence. A senior Democratic aide also expressed *unprecedented* opposition to the pick, emphasizing the need for the FBI to be led by someone from career law enforcement or prosecution backgrounds. 

During a Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse strongly opposed the idea of Lieberman leading the FBI, with a majority of Democrats in agreement. They asserted that the FBI director should come from the ranks of career law enforcement, prosecutors, or the FBI itself. On the other hand, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. Marco Rubio expressing *great admiration* and Sen. John Cornyn predicting a potential unanimous confirmation vote. 

The consideration of Lieberman as FBI director comes amid *stunned* and controversy surrounding Trump's decision to fire Comey last week, particularly due to the FBI's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. Reports have indicated that Trump may have *interfered* with the investigation, leading to *explosive* revelations and concerns about the integrity of the process. END OF SUMMARY.
