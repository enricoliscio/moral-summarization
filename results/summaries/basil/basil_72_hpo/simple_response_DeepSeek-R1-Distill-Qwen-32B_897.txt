Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Trump choosing a replacement for Comey, with Lieberman as the top candidate. I should focus on the key points: who Lieberman is, why his nomination is controversial, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, and the context of Comey's firing and the Russia investigation.

First, I'll mention Trump is close to selecting Lieberman as interim FBI director. Lieberman's background is in politics, not law enforcement, which is a point of contention. Democrats are against this choice because they believe the FBI director should come from law enforcement, not politics. They worry about the independence of the FBI and public confidence. On the other hand, Republicans support Lieberman, highlighting his experience and political background as strengths.

I also need to include the context that this nomination comes after Trump fired Comey, which is under investigation for Russia ties. This adds a moral dimension, as the timing is seen as problematic by Democrats, fearing interference in the investigation.

I'll structure the summary to first state the main event, then outline the opposing viewpoints, and conclude with the implications of the nomination. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring the moral framing is preserved by highlighting the concerns about politicizing the FBI and the potential impact on the Russia investigation.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who argue the FBI director should come from law enforcement ranks. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake," while Sen. Brian Schatz described the nomination as "shocking," warning it would undermine public confidence in the FBI's independence. Democrats also noted the rarity of appointing an FBI director without Senate backing. Meanwhile, Republicans praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain calling him highly qualified. The nomination comes amid heightened scrutiny over Trump's decision to fire Comey, as well as reports suggesting Trump may have interfered in the FBI's Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
