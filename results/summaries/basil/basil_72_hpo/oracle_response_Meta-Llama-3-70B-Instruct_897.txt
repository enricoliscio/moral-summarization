SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience and his background in politics. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake" to select an elected official to the post, while Sen. Brian Schatz said it was "shocking" and "contrary to everything the FBI is about." Schatz argued that it would "undermine" the public's confidence in the agency's independence. Democrats also pointed out that there are many other qualified candidates who could get a unanimous vote. Republicans, on the other hand, praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, which raised concerns that Trump "interfered" with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
