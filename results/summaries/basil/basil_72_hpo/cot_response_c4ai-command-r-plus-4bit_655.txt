SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is reportedly very close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked intense reactions, with Democrats expressing severe reservation and Republicans praising the choice. Senators Claire McCaskill and Brian Schatz strongly oppose Lieberman's nomination, arguing that appointing a politician to lead the FBI is a "*shocking*" and "*mistake*"*. They emphasize the need for the FBI director to come from a law enforcement or prosecutorial background, not politics. A senior Democratic aide also condemns the choice as an "*unprecedented*" move that undermines the independence of the agency. On the other hand, Republicans like Senators Marco Rubio, John Cornyn, and John McCain voice their support for Lieberman, with McCain even going as far as to say, "*screw*" them. The debate over Lieberman's nomination comes amid the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia and the "*stunning*" firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Reports suggest Trump "*interfered*" with the investigation, creating an "*appearance*" of impropriety.
