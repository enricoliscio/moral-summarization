SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. Lieberman, a centrist Democrat, has no federal law enforcement experience, which has sparked severe reservations from Democrats. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake" to select an elected official, while Sen. Brian Schatz said it would "undermine the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency." Republicans, on the other hand, praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired Comey last week, amid the FBI's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
