SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, calling it a "mistake" and "shocking" to appoint a politician to the post. They argue that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official, not a politician, as it would "undermine" the public's confidence in the agency's independence. Sen. Brian Schatz noted that it is "contrary" to everything the FBI is about. Republicans, on the other hand, praised Lieberman, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, a move that has raised concerns about Trump's interference with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia. Trump's actions have been reported to have "interfered" with the investigation, including asking Comey to shut down a probe into Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials.
