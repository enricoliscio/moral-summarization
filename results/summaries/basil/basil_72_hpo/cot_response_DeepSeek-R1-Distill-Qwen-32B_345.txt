Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again. 

The article talks about Trump selecting an interim FBI director. The key morally charged words I see are "unconventional," "reservation," "mistake," "shocking," "undermine," "independence," "unanimous," "precedent," "terrible," "overjoyed," "screw them," "interfere," "explosive," "interference," and "stunning." These words carry strong moral connotations.

Now, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the main points: Trump's choice of Lieberman, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, the context of Comey's firing, and the implications for the FBI's independence.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's selection of Lieberman, noting it's unconventional. Then, I'll highlight the Democrats' reservations, calling it a mistake and shocking, and how it undermines the FBI's independence. I'll contrast that with Republicans' praise. I'll also touch on the context of Comey's firing and the interference allegations, ending with the potential precedent set by appointing a politician.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without getting too detailed. Let me check the word count to stay within 200 words.

**SUMMARY:**
President Trump is nearing the selection of an interim FBI director, with former Senator Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked strong reactions, as Lieberman's political background is seen as unconventional for the role. Democrats express severe reservation, calling it a mistake and shocking, arguing it undermines the FBI's independence. They emphasize the need for a career law enforcement official instead. Republicans, however, praise Lieberman, with some suggesting he could secure unanimous confirmation. The selection comes amid the FBI's investigation into Trump's ties with Russia, following the stunning firing of Comey. Critics warn this move sets a dangerous precedent, with Democrats unanimously opposing the choice. Republicans, meanwhile, defend Lieberman's qualifications, dismissing Democratic concerns. The decision has drawn sharp criticism, with some questioning the wisdom of appointing a politician to lead the FBI, especially during such a critical time. END OF SUMMARY.
