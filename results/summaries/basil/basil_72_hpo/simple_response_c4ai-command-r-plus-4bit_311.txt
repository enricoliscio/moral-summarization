SUMMARY: President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday that he is "very close" to selecting an interim FBI director to replace James Comey, who he fired last week amid an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. The stunning move has raised questions about the independence of the FBI and the integrity of the investigation. Trump's top choice, former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has faced severe criticism from Democrats, who argue that the FBI director should be a career law enforcement official. Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake" to select an elected official, while Sen. Brian Schatz called the possible nomination "shocking." A top Senate Democratic aide said that appointing a politician to head the FBI would be an "unprecedented" and "immense mistake." During a Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse also trashed the idea of appointing a politician to lead the FBI, with a majority of Democrats agreeing that Lieberman is a terrible choice. Republicans, however, have praised Lieberman, with Sen. Marco Rubio expressing "great admiration" and Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" with the pick. The selection of Lieberman, who has said he would support an independent commission to investigate the Trump administration's ties to Russia, raises further ethical concerns about the integrity of the FBI and the potential for political interference in its investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
