SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is nearing a decision on an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. This decision has sparked moral concerns and reservations among Democrats, who argue that appointing a politician to head the FBI "undermines" the independence of the agency and is "contrary" to its values. They assert that the FBI director should have a background in law enforcement, not politics. This move comes amid explosive reports of Trump's interference in the FBI's investigation into his campaign's ties with Russia, including his request to shut down a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials. The selection of Lieberman, a centrist Democrat with no federal law enforcement experience, has the potential to split the Senate, with some Republicans praising the choice while Democrats vehemently oppose it. Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Lieberman, dismissing Democratic concerns.
END OF SUMMARY.
