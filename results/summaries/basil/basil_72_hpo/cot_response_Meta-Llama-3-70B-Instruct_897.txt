SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is close to selecting an interim FBI director, with former Sen. Joe Lieberman as his top choice. However, Democrats are reacting with severe reservation, calling it a "mistake" to select an elected official to the post. Sen. Brian Schatz described the possible nomination as "shocking," saying it's "contrary to everything the FBI is about" and would "undermine" the public's confidence in the agency's independence. Many Democrats agree that Lieberman is a "terrible" choice, while Republicans, on the other hand, praised him, with Sen. John McCain saying he would be "overjoyed" if Lieberman were picked. The need for a new FBI director arose after Trump fired James Comey, a move that has raised concerns about Trump's interference with the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
