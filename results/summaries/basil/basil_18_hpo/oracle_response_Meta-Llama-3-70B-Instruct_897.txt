SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to "end [President Barack] Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage". Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's wrong for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while kids can't pray in school or openly celebrate Christmas. He claims that Obama's administration is "at war with people of faith" and has "mistaken America's tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles". Perry's ad is part of a larger campaign to appeal to conservative voters, with a $1 million broadcast television buy and plans to bring over 600 influential Texans to Iowa in December. Despite this, Perry only garnered 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in a recent Des Moines Register poll.
