SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to put an end to what he perceives as President Obama's "war on religion" in America. Perry's new campaign ad, airing in Iowa, takes aim at the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. He asserts that there is something wrong when gays can serve openly in the military, but children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry promises to fight against what he sees as liberal assaults on America's religious heritage and to restore the influence of faith in the country. He criticizes the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad, deeming it an attack on people of faith. Perry's campaign is making significant efforts in Iowa, purchasing substantial broadcast television time and planning to bring hundreds of influential Texans to the state. However, he currently lags behind in the polls, with only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. END OF SUMMARY.
