SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a new TV ad in Iowa, criticizing President Obama for his stance on religious issues. Perry claims Obama is waging a "war on religion" and vows to end it if elected. Specifically, he opposes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the ban on prayer in public schools. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that faith is essential to America's strength and promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. This ad is part of Perry's recent focus on cultural issues, including his criticism of the Obama administration's decision to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad using foreign aid. Despite his efforts, Perry currently polls at only 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa.
