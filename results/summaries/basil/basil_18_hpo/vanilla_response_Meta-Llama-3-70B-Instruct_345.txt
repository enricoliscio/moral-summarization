SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a new TV ad in Iowa, in which he pledges to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion". Perry criticizes the Obama administration for allowing open service of gays and lesbians in the military and prohibiting prayer in public schools. He claims that faith is being attacked and that America's tolerance for different lifestyles is being mistaken for endorsement. Perry has recently increased his attacks on Obama's cultural policies, including the administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad. Despite his efforts, a recent Des Moines Register poll shows Perry with only 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. Perry's campaign has invested $1 million in broadcast TV time and plans to bring over 600 influential Texans to Iowa in December.

END OF SUMMARY.
