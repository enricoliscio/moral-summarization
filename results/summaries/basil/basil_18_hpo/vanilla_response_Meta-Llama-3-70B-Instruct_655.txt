SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a new TV ad in Iowa, criticizing President Obama's policies on religion. Perry claims Obama is waging a "war on religion" and vows to end it if elected. He specifically targets the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition on prayer in public schools. Perry asserts that faith is essential to America's strength and promises to fight against "liberal attacks" on religious heritage. This ad is part of Perry's increased focus on cultural issues, including his recent criticism of the Obama administration's decision to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad using foreign aid. Despite his efforts, Perry currently polls at just 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa.

END OF SUMMARY.
