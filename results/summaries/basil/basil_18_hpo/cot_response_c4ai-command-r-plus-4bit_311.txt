SUMMARY: 
Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, has pledged to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" by speaking out against the inclusion of gays and lesbians in the military and the ban on prayer in public schools. Perry asserts that it is *wrong* to prioritize the open service of LGBTQ+ individuals in the military over children's ability to openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against what he perceives as *liberal attacks* on America's *religious heritage*. Perry criticizes the Obama administration for its decision to allocate foreign aid for promoting LGBTQ+ rights globally, deeming it a waste of tax dollars on a *lifestyle* that many Americans of *faith* find *objectionable*. He believes Obama has *mistaken* America's *tolerance* for an *endorsement* of these lifestyles. Perry vows to strengthen America by upholding its religious foundations, stating, "Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." Perry's campaign strategy involves significant investments in television advertising and bringing influential Texans to Iowa. However, recent polls show him lagging behind other Republican candidates, with only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa.
