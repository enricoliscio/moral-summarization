SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to "end" what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry rails against the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition on prayer in public schools, arguing that "there's something wrong in this country" when gays can serve openly but children can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. As a self-proclaimed Christian, Perry pledges to "fight" against "liberal attacks" on America's "religious heritage", claiming that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. Perry has also decried the Obama administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it an example of the administration being "at war" with people of faith. Perry's campaign is investing heavily in Iowa, but he currently polls at just 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers.

END OF SUMMARY.
