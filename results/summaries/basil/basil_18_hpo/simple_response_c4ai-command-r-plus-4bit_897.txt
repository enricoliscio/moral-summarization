SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has stooped to a new low in his desperate bid for the presidency, exploiting religious faith and targeting minorities with divisive and discriminatory rhetoric. In a new ad, Perry pledges to end "Obama's war on religion," falsely claiming that Christians are under attack and that their religious freedoms are being restricted. He shamefully uses religion as a weapon to gain political support, distorting the truth and promoting intolerance. Perry's ad condemns the open service of LGBTQ+ individuals in the military while suggesting that celebrating Christmas and praying in school is prohibited, which is simply untrue. He further demonstrates his bigotry by implying that being LGBTQ+ is a "lifestyle" that is objectionable to people of faith. This is a harmful and offensive generalization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to a culture of discrimination and exclusion. It is disturbing that Perry is willing to exploit religion and target vulnerable minorities to further his political ambitions. Such tactics are dangerous and have no place in a diverse and inclusive society.

END OF SUMMARY.
