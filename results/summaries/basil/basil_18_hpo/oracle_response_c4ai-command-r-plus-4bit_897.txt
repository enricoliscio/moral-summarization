SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion" in a new television ad airing in Iowa. Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while claiming that children are prohibited from openly celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He pledges to fight against what he sees as liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry promises to end Obama's supposed war on religion and emphasizes the importance of faith in making America strong. Perry has intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues, including the use of foreign aid to promote rights for gays and lesbians, which he considers an attack on people of faith. His campaign has invested significantly in television advertising time and plans to bring influential Texans to Iowa ahead of the caucuses. However, recent polls show Perry lagging behind other Republican candidates in terms of voter support. END OF SUMMARY.
