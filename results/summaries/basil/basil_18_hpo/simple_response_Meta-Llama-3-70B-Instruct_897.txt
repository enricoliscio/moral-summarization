SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, accusing President Obama of waging a "war on religion" and vowing to end it. Perry criticizes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the ban on prayer in public schools, claiming that faith is being suppressed in America. He argues that it's wrong for the Obama administration to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, as it goes against the values of many Americans of faith. Perry's campaign is stepping up its attacks on Obama over cultural issues, with a $1 million ad buy in Iowa and plans to bring influential Texans to the state in December. Despite this, Perry's support among likely Republican caucus-goers remains low, at just 6%.

END OF SUMMARY.
