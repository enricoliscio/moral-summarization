SUMMARY: Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, pledges to end "Obama's war on religion" in a new ad campaign. Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while restricting public school students from openly celebrating Christmas or praying. He vows to fight against what he perceives as *attacks* on America's *religious heritage* and *faith*. Perry promises to reverse the *wrong* that he believes is being done to people of *faith* in the country. The ad campaign is part of Perry's strategy to intensify his *criticisms* of Obama on cultural issues. He also plans to bring a significant number of Texans to Iowa in December and has invested significantly in broadcast television time ahead of the caucuses. However, recent polls show that Perry's support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa is relatively low.
