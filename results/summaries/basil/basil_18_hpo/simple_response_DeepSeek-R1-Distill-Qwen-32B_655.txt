Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the key points Perry makes regarding his religious stance and his criticisms of Obama's policies.

First, I'll note that Perry is targeting Iowa voters with his ad. He's talking about ending Obama's "war on religion." That's a strong moral statement, so I need to include that. He mentions two main issues: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military and the prohibition of prayer in schools. These are presented as moral issues, so I should highlight that.

Perry's quote about being a Christian and the comparison between military service and celebrating Christmas or praying in schools is important. It shows his stance on religious freedom versus what he perceives as overreach by the government. I should include that quote to capture the moral framing.

He also criticizes Obama's use of foreign aid for promoting gay rights, calling it a war against people of faith. That's another key point about cultural issues. I need to mention that as well.

The article also talks about Perry's campaign spending and the low poll numbers. These are factual details that provide context but don't carry the moral framing. I'll include them briefly to give a complete summary without going into too much detail.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first introducing Perry's ad and its purpose, then outline his main criticisms, include the quotes, mention the foreign aid issue, and wrap up with his campaign efforts and poll numbers. That should cover all the important points while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new television ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the Obama administration for allowing open service of gays and lesbians in the military and banning prayer in public schools, asserting that these policies undermine religious freedom. "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," Perry says, "but there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." He vows to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, emphasizing that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. Perry has also condemned the Obama administration's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it a misuse of tax dollars and a reflection of the administration's war on people of faith. Despite these efforts, Perry's support among Republican caucus-goers in Iowa remains low, at just 6%. END OF SUMMARY.
