Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the main points. 

Perry is attacking Obama, claiming there's a "war on religion." He mentions two issues: gays serving openly in the military and prayer in schools. He's emphasizing his Christian identity and contrasting it with what he sees as Obama's policies that restrict religious expression. 

He also criticizes Obama's foreign aid supporting gay rights, saying it's wrong to use tax dollars for that. There's mention of his campaign spending and efforts to rally support, but his poll numbers are low. 

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: Perry's ad, the two main criticisms, his religious stance, the foreign aid point, and his campaign efforts despite low support. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone from the article. 

I'll start by stating Perry's claim about the war on religion, then list his criticisms. I'll mention his Christian identity and the contrast he draws. Then, include the foreign aid part and his fundraising efforts, ending with his low poll numbers. 

Let me check the word count to make sure it's within limits. Also, ensure that the moral framing is clear, showing Perry's perspective on religious freedom and Obama's policies as problematic. 

I think that covers all the key points without going into too much detail. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a television ad in Iowa, claiming President Barack Obama is waging a "war on religion." Perry criticizes Obama's policies, including the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. He emphasizes his Christian identity, stating, "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," and argues that religious heritage is under attack. Perry vows to end what he perceives as Obama's assault on faith, asserting that "Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." He has also condemned the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "wrong" and a misinterpretation of American tolerance. Despite his efforts, Perry's support among Republican caucus-goers in Iowa remains low, at just six percent. His campaign has invested heavily in advertising and is mobilizing supporters ahead of the January 3 caucuses. END OF SUMMARY.
