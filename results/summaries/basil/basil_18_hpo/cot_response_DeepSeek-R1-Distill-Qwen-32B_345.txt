Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. The user wants me to list them in step 1, each on a new line with an asterisk. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "pledges," "end," "war," "against," "prohibition," "ashamed," "Christian," "wrong," "liberal attacks," "strong," "wrong," "tolerance," "endorsement," and "objectionable" stand out as having moral implications.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should capture the essence of Perry's arguments against Obama's policies, emphasizing his moral stance. I should mention the ad, the specific issues like military service and prayer in schools, Perry's Christian identity, and his criticism of the administration's use of foreign aid for LGBTQ rights. Also, including the political strategy and the poll results will give a complete picture without getting too detailed.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing from the original text. I'll structure it to first introduce Perry's pledge, then outline his criticisms, and finally mention the political moves and poll numbers. This approach should meet the user's requirements and provide a clear, morally framed summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republican candidate Rick Perry has released a television ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." He criticizes the Obama administration for allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while prohibiting prayer in public schools, stating, "There's something wrong in this country." Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and asserts that faith made America strong, vowing to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. He also condemns the administration's use of foreign aid to promote LGBTQ rights, calling it "wrong" and a misuse of tax dollars. Perry has purchased $1 million in TV ads ahead of the Iowa caucuses and plans to bring influential Texans to the state. However, his support among Republican caucus-goers remains low at 6%.
