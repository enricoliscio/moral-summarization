SUMMARY: Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, vows to end "Obama's war on religion" in a TV ad airing in Iowa. Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while restricting children from openly celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He pledges to fight against what he perceives as "liberal attacks" on America's religious heritage. Perry condemns the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote rights for gays and lesbians abroad, deeming it an "endorsement of those lifestyles." The ad reflects Perry's strategy to emphasize cultural issues and his Christian faith. He plans to invest significant resources in Iowa ahead of the caucuses, despite currently polling at only six percent support among Republican caucus-goers. Perry's message is clear: he wants to restore faith in America to make the country strong again. END OF SUMMARY.
