SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion" in a new television ad airing in Iowa. Perry's ad takes on moral issues, criticizing the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while claiming that children are prohibited from openly celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He pledges to fight against what he sees as liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry promises to end this perceived "war," stating that faith can make America strong again. He also criticizes the Obama administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad, calling it an endorsement of a lifestyle that many Americans of faith find objectionable. Perry is increasing his focus on cultural and moral issues, investing $1 million in broadcast time ahead of the Iowa caucuses. However, recent polls show him lagging behind other Republican candidates, with only six percent support among likely caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
