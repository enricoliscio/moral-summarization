SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to "end" what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry attacks the Obama administration for allowing open service of gays and lesbians in the military, while prohibiting prayer in public schools. He claims that "faith made America strong" and promises to "fight" against "liberal attacks" on America's religious heritage. Perry also criticizes the administration's decision to use foreign aid to "promote" rights for gays and lesbians abroad, calling it "wrong" and "objectionable" to people of faith. He argues that Obama has "mistaken" America's tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles. Despite his efforts, Perry only garnered 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in a recent poll.

END OF SUMMARY.
