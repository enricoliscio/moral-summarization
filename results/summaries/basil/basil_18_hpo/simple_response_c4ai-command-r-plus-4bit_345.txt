SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while restricting prayer and celebration of religious events in public schools. Perry pledges to defend America's "religious heritage" and blames the Obama administration for waging a war on people of faith, citing the use of foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad as an attack on moral values. He promises to reverse these policies and make America strong again through faith. Perry has increased his criticism of Obama on cultural issues and plans to invest heavily in campaigning in Iowa, despite low poll numbers. END OF SUMMARY.
