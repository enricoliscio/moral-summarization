SUMMARY:
Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry, who proudly declares "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian", criticizes the Obama administration for allowing open service of gays and lesbians in the military while prohibiting prayer in public schools. He argues that "there's something wrong in this country" when gay rights are prioritized over religious freedoms. Perry also condemns the administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "wrong" and an example of the administration being "at war with people of faith". He promises to "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage" and restore America's strength through faith. Despite his efforts, Perry currently polls at just 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers.
