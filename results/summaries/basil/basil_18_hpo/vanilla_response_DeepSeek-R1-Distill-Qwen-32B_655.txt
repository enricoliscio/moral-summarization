Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, is running ads in Iowa. The main focus is on his criticism of Obama's policies related to religion. He mentions two specific issues: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military and the prohibition against prayer in public schools. He says he's not ashamed to be a Christian but points out that even if someone doesn't go to church every week, they can see that something's wrong when gays can serve in the military but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. 

He vows to end what he calls Obama's war on religion and to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. He believes faith made America strong and can do so again. 

The article also mentions that Perry has been stepping up his attacks on Obama, especially on cultural issues. For example, he criticized Obama's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad. He argues that this is wrong because many Americans of faith find this lifestyle objectionable and that Obama is misinterpreting tolerance as endorsement.

Additionally, the article notes that Perry has purchased a million dollars in TV ads before the January 3 caucuses. He's bringing over 600 Texans to Iowa in December. However, his support among Republican caucus-goers is only six percent, according to a recent poll.

So, to summarize, I need to include all these key points: Perry's ad in Iowa, his criticism of Obama's policies on religion, the two specific issues (military service and school prayer), his vows to end the so-called war on religion, his belief in the importance of faith, his recent criticism of Obama's foreign aid use, and the context of his ad spending and low poll numbers.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to first mention the ad and its main message, then the specific criticisms, his vows, the foreign aid point, and end with the ad spending and his low support.

Let me check the word count as I draft it. I need to be clear and precise, avoiding unnecessary details. Maybe start with the ad and its purpose, then list the issues, his statements, the foreign aid part, and conclude with the ad spending and poll numbers.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together in a coherent summary.
