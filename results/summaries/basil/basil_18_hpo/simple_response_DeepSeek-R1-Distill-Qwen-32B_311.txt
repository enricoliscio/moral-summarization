Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. They specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rick Perry is attacking Obama's policies on religion, specifically targeting military service for gays and lesbians and prayer in schools. He's making a moral argument, linking faith to the strength of America. 

I should note that Perry is using this as part of his campaign strategy, especially in Iowa, and he's investing in ads and bringing supporters there. However, his support is low. I need to make sure the summary includes these elements without losing the moral angle. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new television ad in Iowa, criticizing President Barack Obama for waging a "war on religion." Perry condemns the Obama administration for allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while restricting prayer in public schools, asserting that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. He accuses Obama of promoting a lifestyle many Americans of faith oppose, using foreign aid to advance gay and lesbian rights abroad. Perry has invested $1 million in broadcast ads ahead of the Iowa caucuses and plans to bring 600 Texans to the state, though his support among Republican caucus-goers remains low at 6%.
