SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a new TV ad in Iowa, pledging to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". In the ad, Perry criticizes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition on prayer in public schools. He claims that Obama's administration is "at war with people of faith" and vows to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. Perry has recently increased his attacks on Obama's cultural policies, including the use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad. Despite his efforts, Perry only garnered 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in a recent Des Moines Register poll. The ad is part of a $1 million broadcast television ad buy ahead of the January 3 caucuses.

END OF SUMMARY.
