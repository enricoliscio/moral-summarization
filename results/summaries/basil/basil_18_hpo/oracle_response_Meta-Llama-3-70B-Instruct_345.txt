SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to "end [President Barack] Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage." Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's wrong for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He believes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. Perry has intensified his attacks on Obama's cultural policies, including the administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, which he calls "an administration at war with people of faith." He argues that investing tax dollars in promoting a lifestyle many Americans find "objectionable" is wrong and that Obama has "mistaken America's tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles." Despite his efforts, Perry only garnered 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in a recent poll.
