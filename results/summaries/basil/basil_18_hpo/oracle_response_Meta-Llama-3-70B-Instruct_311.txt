SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to "end" what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion" in a new TV ad, criticizing the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition on prayer in public schools. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's wrong that "gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." He pledges to "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage" and restore faith as a strength of America. Perry has intensified his attacks on Obama's cultural policies, including the use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, which he deems an "attack" on people of faith. He believes Obama has "mistaken" America's tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles. Perry's campaign is investing heavily in Iowa, but he currently polls at just 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers.
