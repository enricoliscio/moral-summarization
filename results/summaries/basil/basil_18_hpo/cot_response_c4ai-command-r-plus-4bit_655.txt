SUMMARY: Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, has pledged to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" in a new TV ad airing in Iowa. Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while restricting public school students from praying or openly celebrating Christmas. He presents himself as unashamed of his Christian faith and blames the current administration for being at war with people of faith. Perry promises to fight against what he perceives as liberal assaults on America's religious heritage, arguing that faith can once again make the country strong. He has intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues, including the use of foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad, which he considers objectionable and a mistake in equating tolerance with endorsement. Despite his efforts and investments in Iowa, Perry currently holds only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
