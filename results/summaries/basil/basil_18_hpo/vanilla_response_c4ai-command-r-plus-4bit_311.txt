SUMMARY: Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, pledges to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" in a new TV ad in Iowa. Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against "liberal attacks" on America's religious heritage and believes faith can make the country strong again. Perry has intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues and has recently criticized the administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad. Perry's campaign has purchased significant TV airtime in Iowa and plans to bring hundreds of Texans to the state ahead of the caucuses. However, a recent poll shows Perry with low support among likely Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
