SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to end "Obama's war on religion" in a new TV ad, criticizing the allowance of gays in the military while restricting religious expression in schools. Perry pledges to fight against "liberal attacks" on America's "religious heritage," emphasizing that faith can make the country strong again. He condemns the use of foreign aid to promote LGBT rights, positioning himself as a defender of religious values against a president who he claims is waging a war on faith. Perry's campaign strategy includes significant ad buys and bringing influential Texans to Iowa, despite low poll numbers. Perry's message frames the issue as a moral battle between religious freedom and secularism, with his candidacy as a bulwark against "objectionable" liberal policies. END OF SUMMARY.
