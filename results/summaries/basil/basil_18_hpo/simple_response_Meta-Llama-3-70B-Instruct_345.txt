SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, accusing President Obama of waging a "war on religion". Perry vows to end this perceived war, citing the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition on prayer in public schools as examples of religious oppression. He claims that faith made America strong and can do so again. Perry has also criticized the Obama administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it an attack on people of faith. The ad is part of a larger effort by Perry to appeal to conservative voters, with his campaign planning to bring over 600 influential Texans to Iowa in December. Despite this, Perry currently polls at just 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers.
