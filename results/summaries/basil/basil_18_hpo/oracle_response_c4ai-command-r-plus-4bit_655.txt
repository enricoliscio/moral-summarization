SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry vows to end "Obama's war on religion" in a new TV ad, criticizing the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the ban on prayer in public schools. Perry pledges to fight against "liberal attacks" on America's religious heritage and to restore faith as a source of national strength. He condemns the Obama administration's use of foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad, claiming it is "investing tax dollars" in a "lifestyle" that people of faith find objectionable. Perry's campaign is ramping up efforts in Iowa with significant ad buys and supporter imports from Texas, despite low poll numbers. Perry's moral stance emphasizes ending the "war," allowing the "serving" of gays, and permitting students to "celebrate" and "pray" in school. He frames his position as a defense against "attacks," promoting faith, and correcting Obama's "mistaken" stance. Perry's strategy leverages moral values to appeal to conservative voters.
