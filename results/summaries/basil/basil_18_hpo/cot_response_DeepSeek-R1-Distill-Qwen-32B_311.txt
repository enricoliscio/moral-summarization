Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad in Iowa. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again to catch those. 

The article mentions "war on religion," which is definitely a moral frame. Then, "open service of gays and lesbians in the military" and "prohibition against prayer in public schools" are both framed morally. Perry says he's not ashamed to be Christian, so "ashamed" is a moral word here. He mentions "gays can serve openly" but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray, so "objectionable" comes up when talking about Obama's policies. 

He also talks about "fighting against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," so "attacks" is another moral term. "Faith made America strong" uses "strong" in a moral sense. The article mentions "tolerance for different lifestyles" and "endorsement of those lifestyles," both of which are moral concepts. 

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Perry's pledge to end Obama's war on religion. Then mention the issues he's highlighting: open service of gays in the military and prayer in schools. Include his Christian statement and the comparison between military service and religious expression. 

Next, mention his fight against liberal attacks and the strength from faith. Also, note his criticism of Obama's foreign aid for gay rights, calling it objectionable. Finally, add the political context: the ad buy, the campaign efforts, and his low support in polls. 

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too lengthy. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each moral term is included naturally.

He criticizes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools, stating, "There's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and pledges to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, claiming "Faith made America strong." He also condemns the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "deeply objectionable." Despite these efforts, Perry's support among Republican caucus-goers remains low at six percent. END OF SUMMARY.
