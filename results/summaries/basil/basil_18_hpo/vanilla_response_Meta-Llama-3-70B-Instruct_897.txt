SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry criticizes the Obama administration's policies, including allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military and prohibiting prayer in public schools. He claims that these policies are an attack on religious heritage and that faith is essential to making America strong again. Perry has also spoken out against the administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it an example of the administration being "at war with people of faith". Despite his efforts, Perry's campaign is struggling, with a recent poll showing him at just 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa.

END OF SUMMARY.
