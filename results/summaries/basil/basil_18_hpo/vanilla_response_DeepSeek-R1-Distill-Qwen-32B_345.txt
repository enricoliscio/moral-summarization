Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. The task is to summarize a provided news article about Rick Perry's campaign ads. They've specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.", and it should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about Rick Perry's television ad in Iowa, where he criticizes Obama's policies on religion. He mentions issues like allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military and the prohibition of prayer in schools. He also criticizes the Obama administration's use of foreign aid for promoting gay rights, arguing it's against the religious values of many Americans.

I should identify the key elements: Perry's claims, the specific policies he's criticizing, his religious stance, and the political context like the upcoming caucuses and his campaign strategy. Also, the article mentions his campaign spending and the poll numbers, which are important to include.

Next, I need to condense this information into a concise summary. I should make sure to mention that Perry is a Republican candidate, his criticisms of Obama, the specific issues he's targeting, his religious statements, and the political strategies like buying ad time and bringing supporters to Iowa. It's also crucial to note that despite these efforts, his support is low.

I have to be careful to stay within 200 words, so I'll need to be succinct. I'll start by stating Perry's main criticism, then outline the specific points he's making, mention the foreign aid issue, and then touch on the political context and his low support. I should avoid any unnecessary details to keep it concise.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his ad, then his criticisms, followed by his religious stance, the foreign aid point, his campaign efforts, and ending with the poll results. This way, the summary is comprehensive yet brief, meeting the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new television ad in Iowa, criticizing President Barack Obama for what he calls a "war on religion." Perry condemns Obama's policies, including the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. He emphasizes his Christian faith and argues that America's religious heritage is under attack. Perry has also criticized the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it a misuse of taxpayer money and a reflection of Obama's misunderstanding of American tolerance. The Texas governor has increased his campaign spending, purchasing $1 million in broadcast time ahead of the January 3 caucuses, and plans to bring over 600 Texans to Iowa. However, recent polls show Perry has only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
