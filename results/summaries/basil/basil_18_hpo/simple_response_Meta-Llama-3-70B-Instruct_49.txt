SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, criticizes the Obama administration for allowing open service of gays and lesbians in the military and prohibiting prayer in public schools. He argues that this is an attack on America's religious heritage and that faith is essential to making America strong again. Perry has also condemned the Obama administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it a "war with people of faith". Despite his efforts, Perry's campaign is struggling, with a recent poll showing him with only 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa.

END OF SUMMARY.
