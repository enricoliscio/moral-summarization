Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want the summary to include the specific morally charged words the author used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rick Perry is attacking Obama's policies, specifically on military service for gays and lesbians and prayer in schools. He uses strong language like "war on religion" and criticizes Obama's administration for promoting gay rights abroad.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "war," "serve," "celebrate," "pray," "end," "fight," "attacks," "faith," "investing," "promoting," "objectionable," and "mistaken." These words carry the moral weight the author intended.

I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's main criticisms and his campaign efforts. I'll mention his ad in Iowa, his Christian identity, and his stance on military service and school prayer. Also, include his criticism of Obama's foreign aid policies and his campaign spending.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting into too much detail. Make sure the moral framing is clear by using the specified words appropriately.

Finally, I'll start the summary with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY: Republican candidate Rick Perry is waging a campaign against what he calls "Obama's war on religion," targeting policies like the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. Perry emphasizes his Christian identity, stating, "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," while criticizing the current administration for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting kids from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He vows to "end Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," asserting that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. Perry has also condemned the Obama administration's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "wrong" and a misinterpretation of American tolerance. Despite his efforts, Perry currently holds only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. His campaign has invested heavily in television ads and plans to bring over 600 Texans to Iowa ahead of the caucuses. END OF SUMMARY.
