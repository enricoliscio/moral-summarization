SUMMARY:
Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, pledging to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry, who is not ashamed to admit he's a Christian, criticizes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition on prayer in public schools. He argues that it's wrong that "our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school" while gays can serve openly in the military. Perry vows to fight against "liberal attacks" on America's "religious heritage" and believes that faith made America strong and can do so again. He also denounces the Obama administration's decision to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it an example of the administration being "at war with people of faith" and an endorsement of a lifestyle that many Americans of faith find objectionable. END OF SUMMARY.
