Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the moral arguments Perry is making.

First, the article mentions Perry's ad in Iowa, targeting Obama's policies. He talks about the "war on religion," which is a strong moral statement. I need to highlight that he's against gay service in the military and prayer bans in schools.

Perry's quotes emphasize his Christian identity and contrast the military policy with Christmas celebrations. That's a key moral point. I should include his statement about faith making America strong again, which ties into the moral foundation of the country.

Also, the article notes his criticism of Obama's foreign aid for gay rights, calling it a war on people of faith. That's another moral angle about using tax dollars for objectionable lifestyles. I should mention that to show his broader cultural stance.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include these moral elements without getting bogged down in details like the ad spending or poll numbers, unless they're essential. I'll structure it to first introduce Perry's ad, then his specific criticisms, and touch on the campaign efforts and poll data briefly.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the main points and then adding context about his campaign and the reception, as that shows the impact of his moral arguments.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a television ad in Iowa, criticizing President Barack Obama for waging a "war on religion." Perry condemns Obama's policies, including the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. He emphasizes his Christian identity, stating, "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," and argues that it is wrong for gays to serve openly in the military while kids cannot celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry vows to end Obama's "war on religion" and defend the country's religious heritage, asserting that "Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." He has also criticized the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it a betrayal of Americans' faith values. Perry's campaign has purchased $1 million in television ads ahead of the Iowa caucuses and plans to bring over 600 Texans to the state. However, his support among likely Republican caucus-goers remains low at six percent. END OF SUMMARY.
