SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has stooped to a new low in his bigoted and discriminatory campaign, blatantly attacking the LGBTQ+ community and religious minorities in a despicable attempt to garner support from conservative voters in Iowa. In a new TV ad, Perry vows to end "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the inclusion of gays and lesbians in the military while lamenting the prohibition on forced prayer in public schools, which respects the religious freedom of all students. Perry's statement reveals his intolerance and ignorance, claiming that allowing LGBTQ+ individuals to serve openly is wrong while implying that celebrating Christmas and praying in school is the right of only a Christian majority. He continues his hateful rhetoric by pledging to fight against "liberal attacks" on a so-called "religious heritage," implying that only one religion defines America's values. This shameful and divisive strategy preys on fear and prejudice, and is a gross distortion of the principles of freedom and equality that America stands for. It is a sad reflection of Perry's desperation to appeal to a narrow-minded and intolerant base.
END OF SUMMARY.
