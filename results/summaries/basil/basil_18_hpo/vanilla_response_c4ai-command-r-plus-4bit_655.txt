SUMMARY: In a new TV ad airing in Iowa, Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry pledges to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage and promote faith in America. Perry has intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues, including the use of foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad. Perry's campaign has invested significantly in broadcast TV time and plans to bring influential Texans to Iowa ahead of the caucuses. However, a recent poll shows Perry with only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers.
