Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

Rick Perry is a Republican candidate who's running ads in Iowa. The main points he's making are about ending Obama's "war on religion." He's talking about two main issues: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. He emphasizes his Christian faith and contrasts the situation where gays can serve in the military but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in schools. He wants to end this "war" and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, stating that faith made America strong.

Perry has also criticized Obama's use of foreign aid to promote gay rights, calling it a wrong investment. He believes this is mistaken, as it's using tax dollars to promote a lifestyle many find objectionable. The article mentions his spending on ads and bringing Texans to Iowa, but his support is low at 6%.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words: war, serve, celebrate, pray, end, fight, attacks, faith, investing, promoting, objectionable, mistaken.

I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's main points and the moral language used. I'll start by stating his pledge to end Obama's war on religion. Then mention the two issues: military service and prayer in schools. Include his statement about being Christian and the contrast. Then his fight against liberal attacks and the importance of faith. Next, his criticism of Obama's foreign aid investment, calling it promoting objectionable lifestyles and mistaken. Finally, mention his ad spending and low support.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the key points and moral terms without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a television ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools, stating, "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," but questions why gays can serve openly in the military while kids cannot celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He pledges to "end Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," emphasizing that "faith made America strong." Perry has also condemned the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "objectionable" and a misuse of tax dollars. He accuses Obama of "mistakenly" equating America's tolerance with endorsement of such lifestyles. Despite his campaign's efforts, including $1 million in ad buys and bringing over 600 Texans to Iowa, Perry currently holds only 6% support among Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
