Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what's being asked. They provided an article about Rick Perry's campaign ads focusing on cultural issues related to religion and morality.

Step 1 is to identify all the morally framed single words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "pledges," "end," "war," "against," "prohibition," "ashamed," "Christian," "wrong," "gays," "serve," "celebrate," "pray," "fight," "attacks," "heritage," "strong," "stepped up," "decried," "foreign aid," "promote," "rights," "lifestyle," "objectionable," "tolerance," "endorsement," "wrong," "support," "likely," "caucuses," "netted," "six percent," "influential," " Texans," "Iowa," "December."

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping those moral words. The summary should highlight Perry's main points: ending Obama's war on religion, opposing gay military service and school prayer bans, promoting religious heritage, and his campaign efforts despite low support. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to maintain the original framing.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to structure it clearly, starting with Perry's pledge, his specific criticisms, his campaign actions, and the current support situation.

Let me put it all together, ensuring that the moral words are included naturally within the summary. I'll make sure it flows well and covers all the essential aspects of the article while adhering to the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry is running ads in Iowa to pledge ending "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and condemns the cultural shifts he believes weaken America's religious heritage. He has stepped up attacks on Obama for promoting gay rights, calling it a misuse of tax dollars and a misunderstanding of American tolerance. Despite Perry's efforts, his campaign has only netted six percent support among Republican caucus-goers, though he is investing heavily in Iowa, including bringing over 600 Texans to the state. END OF SUMMARY.
