SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry criticizes the Obama administration's stance on gay rights, including open service in the military and promoting gay rights abroad through foreign aid. He argues that these policies are an attack on people of faith and that the administration has mistaken tolerance for endorsement. Perry proudly declares himself a Christian and promises to fight against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage, claiming that faith is what made America strong in the first place. The ad is part of a larger campaign effort, with Perry investing $1 million in broadcast TV time and planning to bring over 600 influential Texans to Iowa in December.

END OF SUMMARY.
