Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

Perry is attacking Obama, calling it a "war on religion." He mentions two main issues: gays serving openly in the military and prayer in schools. He's using strong words like "war," "fight," and "attacks." He's also talking about faith making America strong again. 

He's stepped up his attacks on Obama, especially regarding foreign aid for gay rights. He says the administration is at war with people of faith and that investing tax dollars in promoting gay lifestyles is wrong. He's also spending a lot on ads in Iowa, but his support is low.

I need to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. So, I'll mention the "war on religion," "fight," "attacks," "pray," "celebrate," "investing," "promoting," "objectionable," and "mistaken." 

I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's main points and the context, including his spending and low poll numbers. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry is waging a campaign against what he calls President Obama's "war on religion." In a new ad targeting Iowa, Perry criticizes Obama for allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while restricting prayer in public schools. He declares, "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," but argues that the country is "wrong" when it prioritizes gay rights over religious expression. Perry vows to "end Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," emphasizing that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. He has escalated his criticism of Obama's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "objectionable" and a misuse of tax dollars. Perry has invested $1 million in television ads ahead of the Iowa caucuses, but his campaign faces challenges, as recent polls show he garners only 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
