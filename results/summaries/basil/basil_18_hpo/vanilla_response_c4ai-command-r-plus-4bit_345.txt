SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry released a new television ad in Iowa, pledging to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage and believes that faith can make America strong again. Perry has intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues, including the use of foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad. He has invested significantly in broadcast television time ahead of the Iowa caucuses and plans to bring hundreds of influential Texans to the state in December. However, a recent poll showed Perry with only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
