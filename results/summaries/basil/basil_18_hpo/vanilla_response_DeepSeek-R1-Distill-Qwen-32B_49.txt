Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's ad. Let me read through the article first. It's about Perry's new TV ad in Iowa where he talks about ending Obama's war on religion. He mentions issues like gays serving openly in the military and prayer in schools. He says he's a Christian and that it's wrong that gays can serve but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray. He also criticizes Obama's foreign aid for promoting gay rights, which he says is wrong because many Americans oppose that lifestyle. The article mentions that Perry has spent a million dollars on ads and is bringing Texans to Iowa, but his support is only at 6%. 

Okay, so I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Perry's ad, the issues he's addressing (military service and prayer in schools), his criticism of Obama's policies, the spending on ads, and his low support. I need to make sure it's clear and concise. Let me structure it step by step. Start with the ad's purpose, mention the specific criticisms, then the spending and the poll results. Keep each sentence focused and avoid unnecessary details. I should also use quotes where necessary but keep it brief. Make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new television ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry criticizes the Obama administration for allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while prohibiting prayer in public schools. He emphasizes his Christian faith and argues that faith is essential to America's strength. Perry has also condemned the Obama administration's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it an attack on people of faith. Despite these efforts, Perry's support among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa remains low at 6%. He has invested $1 million in television ads and plans to bring over 600 Texans to Iowa ahead of the January 3 caucuses. END OF SUMMARY.
