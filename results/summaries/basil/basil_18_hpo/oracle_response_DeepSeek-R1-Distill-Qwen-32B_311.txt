Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My first thought is to identify the key points in the article. Rick Perry is a Republican candidate, and he's running ads in Iowa. He's talking about ending Obama's "war on religion." That's a strong moral term, so I need to keep that.

He mentions two main issues: gays serving openly in the military and prayer in schools. Both are framed as moral issues. He uses words like "serve" and "pray," which are in the list. Also, he's attacking Obama's policies, using terms like "attacks" and "fight."

I need to make sure to include his statements about faith making America strong again. That's a positive moral statement. Also, he's against using foreign aid to promote gay rights, calling it objectionable. The article mentions his spending on ads and his campaign efforts, but his poll numbers are low.

I should structure the summary to highlight his main points and the moral language. Keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Make sure to include all the key moral terms without making it too long. I'll start by stating his pledge, then the issues, his statements, and end with his campaign efforts and poll numbers.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a television ad in Iowa, vowing to "end Obama's war on religion." He criticizes the Obama administration for allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while restricting prayer in public schools, stating, "There's something wrong in this country" when such policies are in place. Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and asserts that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. He has also condemned the Obama administration for using foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "objectionable" and a misuse of tax dollars. Perry has invested heavily in broadcast ads ahead of the Iowa caucuses and plans to bring influential Texans to Iowa, but his support among likely Republican caucus-goers remains low at six percent. END OF SUMMARY.
