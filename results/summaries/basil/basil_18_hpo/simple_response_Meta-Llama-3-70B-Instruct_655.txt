SUMMARY:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion". Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's wrong that gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military while children can't pray in public schools or celebrate Christmas openly. He claims that the Obama administration is at war with people of faith, citing its decision to use foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad as an example. Perry believes that America's tolerance for different lifestyles is being mistaken for endorsement, and promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage if elected. His campaign has invested heavily in TV ads and is bringing influential Texans to Iowa to drum up support, despite currently polling at just 6% among likely Republican caucus-goers.

END OF SUMMARY.
