SUMMARY:
Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry is pledging to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion" in a new TV ad airing in Iowa. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, claims that Obama's administration is at war with people of faith, citing the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition against prayer in public schools as examples. Perry argues that it's "wrong" that kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school, while gays can serve openly in the military. He vows to "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage" and claims that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." Perry has also criticized Obama's decision to use foreign aid to promote rights for gays and lesbians abroad, calling it "wrong" and an "endorsement" of a lifestyle many Americans of faith find "objectionable."
