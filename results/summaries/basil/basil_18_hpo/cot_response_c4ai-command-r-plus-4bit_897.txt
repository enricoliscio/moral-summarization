SUMMARY:
In a new television ad, Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry pledges to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the allowance of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. Perry proudly proclaims his Christian faith and asserts that it is *wrong* that gays can serve openly while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against what he perceives as *attacks* on America's religious heritage, arguing that faith can make the country strong again. Perry has intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues, including the use of foreign aid to promote gay rights abroad, which he deems an affront to people of *faith* and *objectionable* to many Americans. Perry's campaign is investing significant resources in Iowa ahead of the caucuses, but he currently lags in the polls, with only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers.
