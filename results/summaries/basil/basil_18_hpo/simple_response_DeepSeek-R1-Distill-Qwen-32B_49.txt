Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Perry's campaign ads. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

So, Perry is attacking Obama's policies, specifically the "war on religion." He mentions allowing gays and lesbians in the military and prohibiting prayer in schools. He's emphasizing his Christian values and contrasting the two issues. He's also talking about using foreign aid to promote gay rights, which he sees as an attack on religious people. The article also notes his spending on ads and his low poll numbers.

I should make sure to include the moral arguments he's making, like the conflict between religious freedom and Obama's policies. I need to highlight his main points without adding my own opinions. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

Let me structure the summary: start with Perry's ad and his main criticisms, mention his Christian identity, contrast the military policy with school prayer, his stance on foreign aid, and the political context like ad spending and poll numbers. Make sure it's clear and sticks to the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a television ad in Iowa, criticizing President Barack Obama for waging a "war on religion." Perry condemns Obama's policies, including the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools, arguing that these actions undermine America's religious heritage. "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," Perry states, emphasizing that faith has made America strong and can do so again. He also criticized Obama's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it an attack on people of faith. Perry's campaign has purchased $1 million in television ads ahead of the Iowa caucuses, though recent polls show he has only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers. His efforts reflect a broader strategy to rally cultural conservatives around his candidacy. END OF SUMMARY.
