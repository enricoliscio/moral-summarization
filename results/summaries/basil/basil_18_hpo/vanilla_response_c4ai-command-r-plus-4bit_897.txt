SUMMARY: Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has released a new television ad airing in Iowa, pledging to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry criticizes the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition against prayer in public schools. He promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage and promote faith in America. Perry has recently intensified his criticism of Obama on cultural issues, including the administration's decision to use foreign aid to promote LGBT rights abroad. According to reports, Perry has invested significantly in television advertising time in Iowa ahead of the January caucuses and plans to bring hundreds of Texans to the state for his campaign. However, a recent poll shows him with only six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers. END OF SUMMARY.
