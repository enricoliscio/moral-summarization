SUMMARY:
Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, vowing to end what he calls "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion". Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's "wrong" that gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military, while kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He pledges to "fight against liberal attacks" on America's "religious heritage", which he believes has made the country "strong". Perry has also criticized the Obama administration's decision to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad, calling it "wrong" and an example of the administration being "at war with people of faith". Despite his efforts, Perry only garnered 6% support among likely Republican caucus-goers in a recent poll. END OF SUMMARY.
