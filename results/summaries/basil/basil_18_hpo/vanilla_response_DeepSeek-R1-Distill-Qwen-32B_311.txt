Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, who is running ads in Iowa. He's talking about ending Obama's so-called "war on religion." In his ad, he criticizes two main things: the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in public schools. He mentions that he's a Christian and feels it's wrong that gays can serve openly but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in schools. He wants to fight against these liberal attacks on religious heritage and believes faith made America strong.

Additionally, the article mentions that Perry has been attacking Obama on cultural issues, like using foreign aid to promote gay rights abroad. He thinks this is wrong and that Obama is at war with people of faith. He's spending a lot on ads and bringing supporters to Iowa, but his support among Republicans is low, only six percent.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: Perry's ad, his criticisms of Obama's policies, his religious stance, his recent attacks, and his campaign efforts despite low support.

Let me structure this clearly, making sure each main point is covered concisely. I should avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the essential information. Also, I need to make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.
