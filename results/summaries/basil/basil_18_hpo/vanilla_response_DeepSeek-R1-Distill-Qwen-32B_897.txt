Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Rick Perry's television ad. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, is running ads in Iowa. His main focus is on what he calls "Obama's war on religion." He's criticizing two main policies: the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition against prayer in public schools. 

Perry emphasizes his Christian identity and argues that it's wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in schools. He's promising to end this "war on religion" as president and to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, stating that faith made America strong.

Additionally, the article notes that Perry has been stepping up his attacks on Obama, specifically mentioning the administration's use of foreign aid to promote gay and lesbian rights abroad. He criticizes this as wrong and against the values of many Americans of faith.

There's also some context about Perry's campaign spending and efforts to bring supporters to Iowa, but his support among likely caucus-goers is only at six percent, which is low.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main points: Perry's ad content, his criticisms of Obama's policies, his religious stance, his campaign efforts, and his low polling numbers.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Perry and his ad, then detail his criticisms, mention the recent attacks on Obama's policies, and conclude with the campaign spending and low support. I'll make sure to keep it concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary details.

Let me draft the summary now, ensuring it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the required tokens.
