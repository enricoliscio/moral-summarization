Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Rick Perry's TV ad where he criticizes Obama's policies on religion. He mentions the open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition of prayer in schools. He uses strong words like "war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks." 

I need to make sure to include words like "war," "serve," "pray," "end," "fight," "attacks," "faith," "investing," "promoting," "objectionable," and "mistaken." 

I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's main points: ending Obama's war on religion, opposing gay military service and school prayer bans, and criticizing Obama's use of foreign aid for gay rights. Also, mention the political moves like buying TV time and bringing Texans to Iowa, despite low poll numbers.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: Republican candidate Rick Perry is running ads in Iowa accusing President Obama of waging a "war on religion." Perry criticizes Obama's policies, such as allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while prohibiting prayer in public schools. He vows to "end Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks" on faith. Perry emphasizes the importance of "faith" in making America strong and condemns the administration for "investing" tax dollars to "promote" gay rights, calling it "objectionable" to many Americans of faith. He claims Obama has "mistaken" tolerance for different lifestyles as endorsement. Despite these efforts, Perry has only six percent support among Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. END OF SUMMARY.
