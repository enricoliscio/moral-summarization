SUMMARY:
Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at CPAC 2010, demanding that Republicans prioritize ideological purity over expanding their coalition. Beck argued that "progressivism" is designed to "eat the Constitution" and that the GOP must undergo a 12-step program of recovery, admitting their addiction to "spending and big government." He urged lawmakers to deliver an apology, saying "Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I got a problem." Beck's message was clear: supporting the Democratic agenda would no longer fly with the modern GOP. He rejected the idea of a "big tent," saying "America is not a clown show. America is not a circus. America is an idea. America is an idea that sets people free." The crowd was enthralled by Beck's speech, which intertwined his personal story of struggle and redemption with his political message.
