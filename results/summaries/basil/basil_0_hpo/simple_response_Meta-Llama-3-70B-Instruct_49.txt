SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a powerful speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck emphasized that the party needs to get its own house in order before attempting to govern again. He criticized Republicans for being addicted to spending and big government, and argued that supporting Democratic agendas would no longer be tolerated. Beck's speech was personal, drawing from his own experiences as a recovering alcoholic and his lack of formal education. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare. The crowd was enthralled by Beck's message, which emphasized that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or a clown show. Beck's call for ideological purity was a stark contrast to the traditional approach of expanding the party's coalition to win elections. END OF SUMMARY.
