SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck argued that the GOP needs to get its own house in order before attempting to govern, and that supporting Democratic agendas will no longer be tolerated. He called for a "Come-To-Jesus moment" from Republicans, admitting their addiction to spending and big government. Beck's speech was a personal and passionate plea for conservatism to succeed, rather than just opposing Democrats. He warned against the dangers of progressivism, which he believes is designed to "eat the Constitution." Beck's message was clear: America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or a clown show, and ideological purity is the path to redemption and recovery. END OF SUMMARY.
