SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck declared that "progressivism is eating the Constitution" and that it was "designed to eat the Constitution." He emphasized that conservatism must succeed, rather than just trying not to "suck as much as the other side." Beck called for Republicans to embark on a 12-step program of recovery, admitting their addiction to spending and big government. He warned against supporting anything that resembles the Democratic agenda, stating that America is not a "circus" or a "clown show," but an idea that sets people free. Beck's message was clear: the GOP must launch a movement of redemption and recovery, rather than trying to broaden their appeal. The crowd was enthralled by Beck's words, which emphasized the importance of purity and succeeding in the pursuit of conservative ideals. END OF SUMMARY.
