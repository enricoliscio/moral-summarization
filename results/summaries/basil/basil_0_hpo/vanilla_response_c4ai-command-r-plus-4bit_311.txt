SUMMARY: In his keynote speech at CPAC 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded that Republicans focus on ideological purity and get their own house in order before attempting to govern again. Beck used his own story of personal struggle and redemption to illustrate his point, urging the GOP to admit their problems with spending and big government. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare, intertwining his message with tales of Calvin Coolidge, the Statue of Liberty, and the supposed great middle-class explosion of the 1920s. Beck's message of ideological purity stood in contrast to traditional political strategies of expanding coalitions to win elections. He argued that America is not a circus but an idea that sets people free. Beck's speech, which captivated the CPAC audience, emphasized the need for conservatism to succeed and for Republicans to undergo a 12-step program of recovery.
