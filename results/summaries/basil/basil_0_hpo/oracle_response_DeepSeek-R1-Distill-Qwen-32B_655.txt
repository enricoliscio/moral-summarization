Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010 is the focus. He's talking about Republicans needing to get their house in order before trying to govern again. He criticized Democrats, saying progressivism is "eating" the Constitution. He emphasized the need for purity within the GOP, not just opposing Democrats but actually succeeding. He mentioned Dick Cheney's optimism but pointed out it's not enough to just be better than the other side.

He criticized a Republican, likely John McCain, for admiring Teddy Roosevelt, who he blames for launching progressive movements. Beck urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step program, likening their addiction to spending and big government. He used his personal story of recovery to make the point, which made the speech more impactful.

The article also contrasts this with the usual approach of expanding the coalition to broaden appeal, but Beck and the CPAC crowd preferred ideological purity. He criticized the idea of a big tent, calling it a circus, and instead emphasized America as an idea that sets people free.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the morally framed words: eating, eat, purity, succeed, launching, embark, addicted, broaden, show, circus, free. I should make sure these words are included naturally in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning Beck's speech at CPAC, his criticism of progressivism eating the Constitution. Then, his demand for purity within Republicans, not just being better than Democrats. Mention the 12-step program, addiction to spending, and his personal analogy. Contrast with the big tent approach, calling it a circus, and ending with America as an idea that frees people.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all key points and moral words are included without making it too lengthy.

Finally, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's clear and meets all the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, in his 2010 CPAC speech, demanded Republican purity and success, criticizing progressivism for "eating" the Constitution. He urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step recovery program, likening their addiction to spending and big government to his own struggles with alcoholism. Beck emphasized that merely "not suck[ing] as much as the other side" was insufficient, rejecting the idea of a "big tent" approach. Instead, he argued for ideological purity, dismissing the notion of broadening appeal as a "circus." Drawing on his personal journey, Beck called for a return to conservative principles, asserting that America is an idea that sets people "free." END OF SUMMARY.
