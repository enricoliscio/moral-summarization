SUMMARY: In his CPAC 2010 keynote speech, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck urged Republicans to focus on ideological purity and demanded that they get their own house in order before seeking to govern again. Beck, known for his bombastic style, used his personal story of struggle and redemption to make his point, urging the GOP to embark on a 12-step recovery program. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare. Beck's message was clear: supporting anything resembling the Democratic agenda would no longer be tolerated by the modern GOP. He accused the Republican Party of being addicted to spending and big government, and called for a return to conservatism as the path to redemption and recovery. Beck's speech stood out for its demand that conservatism succeed, and his intertwining of his own personal story made it all the more effective. However, his focus on ideological purity raises questions about the traditional strategy of political parties to expand their coalitions when out of power. Beck's passionate and captivating address set a moral tone for the conservative movement, but it remains to be seen if it will translate into electoral success.
