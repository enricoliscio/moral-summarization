SUMMARY: In his CPAC 2010 speech, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded that Republicans achieve ideological purity and embark on a path to redemption and recovery. Beck urged the GOP to admit its problems with spending and big government, drawing on his own experience as a recovering alcoholic. He railed against government handouts and progressivism, which he accused of eating the Constitution. Beck's message was clear: the Republican Party needed to broaden its appeal, but not by sacrificing its principles and becoming a circus. Instead, he emphasized that America is an idea that sets people free.
