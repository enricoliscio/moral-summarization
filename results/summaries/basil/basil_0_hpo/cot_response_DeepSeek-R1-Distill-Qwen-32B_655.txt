Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They also provided a specific structure for the response, including identifying morally framed words and then writing the summary.

First, I should go through the article to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. These are words that express judgments or values. Let me read through the article again.

Glenn Beck is talking about Republicans needing to get their house in order before trying to govern again. He criticizes Democrats, saying progressivism is eating the Constitution. He also talks about ideological purity, not just being less bad than the other side. He mentions Dick Cheney and conservative ideas, but it's not enough to just not suck as much. He criticizes a Republican (probably McCain) for admiring Teddy Roosevelt, who he says started the progressive movement. He urges the GOP to do a 12-step program, comparing it to his own recovery from alcoholism. He argues against government handouts and health care rights, tying it to his lack of formal education. The article contrasts this with the idea of a big tent, which Beck dismisses as a circus.

Now, identifying the morally framed words: "progressivism," "eating," "Constitution," "purity," "suck," "handouts," "right," "addicted," "problem," "circus," "idea," "free." These words carry judgments or values.

Next, I need to summarize the article, keeping these moral terms. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating Beck's main points: urging Republicans to focus on purity, criticizing progressivism, and rejecting the idea of a big tent. I'll mention his personal struggles and the 12-step analogy. I'll also highlight his arguments against government handouts and health care rights. Finally, I'll note the contrast between his approach and traditional political strategies.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first introduce Beck's speech, then his criticisms, his personal analogy, and the conclusion about the conservative movement's direction.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together following the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
Glenn Beck, in his 2010 CPAC speech, urged Republicans to focus on ideological purity and reject the notion of a "big tent" coalition. He criticized progressivism for "eating" the Constitution and called for conservatism to succeed on its own merits, not just by being less flawed than the Democrats. Beck, drawing parallels to his personal recovery from alcoholism, likened the GOP to a 12-step program, urging the party to admit its "problem" with spending and big government. He dismissed government handouts and the idea of a "right" to health care, tying these criticisms to his lack of formal education. Beck's message emphasized that America is an "idea" meant to set people "free," not a political circus. His speech contrasted with traditional strategies of expanding coalitions, instead advocating for a return to core conservative principles. END OF SUMMARY.
