SUMMARY:
Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck demanded that Republicans get their own house in order before seeking governance, warning that "progressivism" is designed to "eat the Constitution." He emphasized the need for conservatism to succeed, rather than just being less bad than the Democratic agenda. Beck's speech was a call to redemption and recovery, likening the Republican Party's addiction to spending and big government to his own struggles with alcoholism. He argued that America is not a "circus" or a "clown show," but an "idea that sets people free." Beck's message was clear: purity is the path to redemption and recovery. END OF SUMMARY.
