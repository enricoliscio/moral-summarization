SUMMARY: In his keynote speech at CPAC 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded purity and ideological consistency from the Republican Party. Beck argued that the party needed to get its own house in order and embark on a path of redemption and recovery, drawing on his own personal struggles with addiction as an analogy. He criticized the notion of a "big tent" strategy, arguing that America is not a circus but an idea that sets people free. Beck urged Republicans to admit their problems with spending and big government and called for a return to conservative principles. He also took swipes at Democrats and progressives, declaring that their ideology was eating away at the Constitution. Beck's message of ideological purity over coalition-building was well-received by the CPAC crowd, but it remains to be seen if it is the path to success for the GOP.
END OF SUMMARY.
