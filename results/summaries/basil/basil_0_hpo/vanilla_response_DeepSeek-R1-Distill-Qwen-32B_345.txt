Okay, I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host, gave a speech closing the three-day conference. He emphasized that Republicans need to get their house in order before trying to govern again. His speech was personal, using hand gestures, impersonations, and his chalkboard. He criticized Democrats, saying progressivism is eating the Constitution. But the main focus was on demanding purity within the GOP.

He contrasted this with previous years, like when Rush Limbaugh urged Obama to fail. Beck's message was about conservatism succeeding through purity. He criticized Dick Cheney for saying it's a good year for conservative ideas but added that it's not enough to just be better than the other side. He implied that some Republicans, like John McCain, were too close to the Democratic agenda.

Beck also used his personal story, mentioning his recovery from alcoholism, to urge the GOP to follow a 12-step program. He wanted them to admit their addiction to spending and big government. He criticized government handouts and the idea of a right to healthcare. The crowd was captivated, even as he went into historical references.

The article ends by questioning if this message was what the conservative movement needed. It notes that political parties usually try to expand their coalition when out of power, but Beck and CPAC attendees preferred ideological purity over a big tent.

So, the summary should capture Beck's call for GOP purity, his criticism of Democrats, his personal analogy with a 12-step program, and the rejection of a big tent strategy. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include these key points.
