SUMMARY: In his keynote speech at CPAC 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded that Republicans get their house in order and embrace ideological purity as the path to redemption and recovery. Beck, known for his bombastic style, used hand gestures, impersonations, and his infamous chalkboard to captivate the audience. He argued that progressivism is eating away at the Constitution and that the Republican Party needs to admit its addiction to spending and big government. Beck intertwined his own story of struggle and redemption, urging the GOP to embark on a 12-step recovery program. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare, reflecting on his lack of formal education. Beck's message was clear: supporting anything resembling the Democratic agenda would no longer be tolerated by the modern GOP. He called for a return to conservatism and for Republicans to have their "Come-To-Jesus" moment. Beck's speech stood out for its demand that conservatism succeed, rather than simply hoping for the failure of President Barack Obama.
