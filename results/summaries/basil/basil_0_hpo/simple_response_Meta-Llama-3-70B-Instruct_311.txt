SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck argued that the party needs to get its own house in order before attempting to govern, and that supporting Democratic agendas will no longer be tolerated. He called for a "Come-To-Jesus moment" from Republicans, acknowledging their addiction to spending and big government. Beck's speech was personal, drawing from his own experiences as a recovering alcoholic and criticizing government handouts. He emphasized that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or clown show. Beck's message was clear: the path to redemption and recovery lies in ideological purity, not in trying to appeal to a broader audience. The crowd was enthralled, but the question remains whether this message is what the conservative movement needs to hear.
