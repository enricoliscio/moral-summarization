SUMMARY: In a passionate and winding speech at CPAC in 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded that the Republican Party acknowledge its problems and embrace ideological purity as the path to redemption and success. Beck, known for his bombastic style, used his own story of struggle and redemption to urge the GOP to embark on a 12-step program, declaring, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I got a problem. I'm addicted to spending and big government." He railed against government handouts and progressivism, which he accused of "eating the Constitution." Beck's message was clear: the party needed to broaden its appeal without sacrificing its principles, and it needed to offer a compelling vision for the future. "America is not a clown show," he declared. "America is an idea that sets people free." The crowd was enthralled by Beck's call for conservatism to succeed and for the GOP to undergo a Come-To-Jesus moment, admitting its problems and embracing a path of recovery and ideological purity.
