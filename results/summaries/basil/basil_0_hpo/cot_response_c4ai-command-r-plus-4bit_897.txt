STEP 1:
*Purity
Redemption
Recovery
Fail
Addicted
Handouts*

SUMMARY: 
In his speech at CPAC in 2010, conservative commentator Glenn Beck demanded ideological purity from the Republican Party, framing it as a moral imperative for redemption and recovery. Beck urged the GOP to admit its "addiction to spending and big government," rejecting the notion of a "big tent" that dilutes conservative ideals. He chastised the party for its failure to acknowledge its problems and called for a return to core conservative principles, decrying the influence of progressivism and its assault on the Constitution. Beck's message, intertwined with his personal story of struggle and triumph, captivated the CPAC audience. He railed against government "handouts" and emphasized the importance of individual responsibility, opposing a right to healthcare. Beck's plea for ideological purity stood in contrast to traditional political strategies of broadening the appeal to win elections, instead advocating for a principled stance that would set people free from the perceived evils of progressivism and big government.
