SUMMARY: 

Glenn Beck delivered a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2010, urging Republicans to focus on their own ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck criticized the GOP for not acknowledging their own problems, such as addiction to spending and big government, and called for a 12-step program of recovery. He argued that conservatism should succeed on its own merits, rather than simply trying to be less bad than the Democratic party. Beck also railed against government handouts and the idea of a right to healthcare, drawing on his own personal experiences as a recovering alcoholic and someone without formal education. The speech was well-received by the packed auditorium, but some may question whether ideological purity is the best path for the conservative movement.
