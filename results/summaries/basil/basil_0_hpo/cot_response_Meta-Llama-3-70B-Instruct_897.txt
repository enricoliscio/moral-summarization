SUMMARY:
Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a powerful speech at CPAC, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck demanded that the GOP get its own house in order, acknowledging that they have a "problem" with "addiction" to spending and big government. He emphasized the need for "redemption" and "recovery" within the party, rather than trying to appeal to a broader audience. Beck criticized the idea of a "big tent" approach, arguing that America is not a "circus" but an "idea" that sets people "free". He warned against supporting Democratic agendas, stating that "progressivism" is designed to "eat the Constitution". Beck's speech was well-received by the crowd, who were captivated by his personal story of struggle and redemption. END OF SUMMARY.
