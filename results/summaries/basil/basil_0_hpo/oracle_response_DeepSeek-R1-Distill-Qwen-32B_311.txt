Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language.

First, Beck is talking about Republicans needing to get their house in order. He uses words like "eating" the Constitution, which is a strong moral statement against progressivism. He also emphasizes "purity" among conservatives, so that's another moral term to include.

He mentions Dick Cheney and says it's a good year for conservative ideas, but he's critical of just not being as bad as the other side. He singles out a Republican, probably McCain, for admiring Teddy Roosevelt, who he blames for launching progressivism. So "launching" is another moral term.

Beck talks about the Republican Party being "addicted" to spending and big government, using his own 12-step analogy. He also criticizes the idea of a "big tent," calling it a circus, which ties into the "show" and "circus" moral words.

He ends by saying America is an idea that sets people free, so "free" is important. The summary needs to include these words and capture Beck's call for ideological purity over expanding the coalition.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Beck's main points: the need for Republican purity, criticism of progressivism, the 12-step analogy, rejection of a big tent, and the idea of America as a freeing concept. I'll make sure to include all the specified moral terms without making it too long, keeping it under 200 words.
