Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the underlying moral message.

The article describes Beck's speech where he emphasizes the need for Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than expanding their base. He compares this to his own recovery from alcoholism, suggesting a 12-step program for the GOP. He criticizes the party for not admitting their problems and for not being distinct enough from Democrats.

I should note the key elements: Beck's call for purity, his personal analogy, criticism of McCain and Teddy Roosevelt, the rejection of the "big tent" approach, and his view of America as an idea tied to freedom and limited government.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, keeping the moral aspect intact. I'll make sure to highlight Beck's emphasis on unity and adherence to principles, contrasting it with the usual strategy of broadening appeal. I should also include his personal story as part of the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the event, then his main message, the methods he used (like the 12-step analogy), his criticism of the party's lack of self-reflection, and his rejection of the big tent strategy. I'll end with his view of America as an idea about freedom, tying it back to the moral stance of staying true to principles.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the essential points. Let me draft this, making sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral framing.

SUMMARY: At the 2010 CPAC conference, Glenn Beck urged Republicans to prioritize ideological purity over broadening their appeal, rejecting the "big tent" approach. Drawing parallels to his own recovery from alcoholism, Beck called for a 12-step program of self-reflection and reform for the GOP, likening their addiction to spending and big government to his past struggles. He criticized the party for failing to acknowledge its problems and for not distinguishing itself from Democrats, whom he accused of promoting progressive policies that erode constitutional principles. Beck emphasized that conservatism must succeed through unity and adherence to core values, rather than simply opposing the other side. His speech intertwined personal anecdotes and historical references, reinforcing the moral imperative for the GOP to embrace a purer, more principled path. END OF SUMMARY.
