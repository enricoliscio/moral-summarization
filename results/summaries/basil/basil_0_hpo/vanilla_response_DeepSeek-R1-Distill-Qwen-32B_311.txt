Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. Let me read through the article carefully.

Okay, the article starts by mentioning that Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host, gave a speech closing the three-day CPAC conference. He urged Republicans to get their own house in order before trying to govern again. His speech was long, about an hour, and he used various methods like hand gestures and a chalkboard. He criticized Democrats, calling progressivism a threat to the Constitution.

But the main focus was on demanding purity within the Republican party. He talked about how conservatism needs to succeed, not just oppose the Democrats. He criticized the GOP for not admitting their problems, like being addicted to spending and big government. He even used his own story of recovering from alcoholism to push for a 12-step program for the party.

He also criticized the idea of a "big tent" for Republicans, saying America isn't a circus but an idea that sets people free. The article contrasts this with traditional political strategy of expanding coalitions to win elections.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Beck's speech at CPAC, his main points about GOP unity and purity, his criticism of Democrats, and his metaphor about the party needing to recover. I'll also include his rejection of the big tent approach and the traditional political strategy.

I should make sure the summary is clear and captures all key points without being too detailed. Let me structure it: introduction of Beck and the event, his demands for the GOP, his methods and metaphors, and the contrast with traditional strategies.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's concise and within the word limit.

Beck's speech stood out for its focus on conservatism's potential success, contrasting with previous calls for Democrats to fail. His address captivated the audience with a mix of humor, personal stories, and sharp criticism of both Democrats and moderate Republicans.
