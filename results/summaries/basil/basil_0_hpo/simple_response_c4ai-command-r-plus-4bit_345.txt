SUMMARY: Moralistic pundit Glenn Beck took the stage at CPAC to deliver a scathing critique of the Republican Party, demanding ideological purity and a rejection of anything resembling the Democratic agenda. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, framed his message as a 12-step program for the GOP's recovery, urging them to admit their addiction to spending and big government. He railed against progressivism, arguing it was designed to undermine the Constitution, and targeted Teddy Roosevelt as the initiator of the modern progressive movement. Beck's speech stood out for its demand that conservatism succeed and for its intertwining of his personal story of struggle and redemption. He rejected the idea of a "big tent," insisting that America is an idea, not a circus. Instead, he called for ideological purity as the path to redemption and recovery for the conservative movement.
END OF SUMMARY.
