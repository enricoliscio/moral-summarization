SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at the CPAC conference, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck argued that the party needs to get its own house in order before trying to govern again, and that supporting Democratic agendas will no longer be tolerated. He used personal anecdotes, including his struggles with addiction and lack of formal education, to illustrate the need for the GOP to embark on a "12-step program of recovery" from its addiction to spending and big government. Beck's message was clear: the party needs to admit its problems and take responsibility for its actions. He rejected the idea of a "big tent" approach, arguing that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or clown show. The crowd was captivated by Beck's speech, which was more focused on demanding purity among his allies than attacking Democrats.
