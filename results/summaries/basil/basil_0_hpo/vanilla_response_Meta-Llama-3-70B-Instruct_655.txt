SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at the CPAC conference, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck demanded that Republicans get their own house in order before trying to govern again, criticizing those who support Democratic-style big government and spending. He used personal anecdotes, including his own struggles with addiction, to illustrate the need for the GOP to embark on a 12-step program of recovery. Beck's message was clear: supporting anything that resembles the Democratic agenda will no longer be tolerated in the modern GOP. He also railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare. The crowd was enthralled, but Beck's message may not be what the conservative movement needs to hear, as it goes against the traditional approach of expanding the coalition to win elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
