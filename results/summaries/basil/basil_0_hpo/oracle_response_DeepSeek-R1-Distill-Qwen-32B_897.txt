Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided an article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The key is to summarize the text while keeping the moral words intact.

First, I should read the article carefully. Beck is talking about Republicans needing to get their house in order before governing again. He's using strong moral language like "eating," "purity," "addicted," and "circus." The summary needs to include these words to maintain the author's framing.

I notice the article mentions Beck's personal struggles, which he ties into the GOP's need for recovery. He uses metaphors like a 12-step program and compares the party to an addict. I should include these elements to show the moral imperative.

The user specified that the summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll focus on the main points: Beck's demand for purity, criticism of progressive policies, the 12-step analogy, and his rejection of a big tent strategy. I'll also highlight his use of moral terms to emphasize the need for change.

I should structure the summary to start with Beck's main message, then touch on his criticisms, personal analogies, and the rejection of broadening the coalition. Ending with the moral framing about America as an idea will tie it all together.

Let me make sure I include all the required moral words: eating, purity, succeed, launching, embark, addicted, broaden, show, circus, free. I'll weave these into the summary naturally without forcing them.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck's 2010 CPAC speech emphasized the need for Republican purity and ideological clarity, rejecting the idea of a "big tent" approach. He criticized progressives for "eating" the Constitution and warned against policies resembling the Democratic agenda. Beck demanded that conservatives "succeed" by embracing their principles, not just by "not suck[ing] as much as the other side." He likened the GOP to an addict, urging a 12-step program of recovery, including admitting addiction to spending and big government. Beck's moral framing included terms like "purity," "addicted," and "circus," contrasting America as an "idea" that sets people "free." Rejecting the notion of broadening appeal, he argued that ideological purity, not expansion, was the path to redemption. END OF SUMMARY.
