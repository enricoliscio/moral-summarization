SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to get their own house in order before attempting to govern again. Beck emphasized the need for ideological purity within the party, warning that supporting Democratic agendas would no longer be tolerated. He criticized the notion of a "big tent" approach, instead advocating for a 12-step program of recovery from the party's addiction to spending and big government. Beck's speech was a call to action, demanding that Republicans admit their problems and embark on a path of redemption and recovery. He argued that America is not a circus or a show, but an idea that sets people free. Beck's message was clear: the party must succeed by staying true to its conservative principles, rather than trying to broaden its appeal by compromising its values. By doing so, Beck believes the party can restore its integrity and ultimately succeed.
