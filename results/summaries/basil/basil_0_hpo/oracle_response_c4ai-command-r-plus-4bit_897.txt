SUMMARY: In his CPAC 2010 speech, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded that the Republican Party get its house in order and embrace ideological purity as the path to redemption and recovery. Beck urged the GOP to admit its problems with spending and big government, drawing parallels with his own struggle as a recovering alcoholic. He railed against government handouts and progressivism, which he accused of eating the Constitution. Beck's message stood out for its demand that conservatism succeed and for its focus on intra-party criticism rather than attacks on ideological foes. He argued that America is not a circus or a clown show, but an idea that sets people free. The speech, which intertwined Beck's personal story with his political beliefs, captivated the CPAC audience, but it remains to be seen if ideological purity is the key to electoral success for the GOP.
