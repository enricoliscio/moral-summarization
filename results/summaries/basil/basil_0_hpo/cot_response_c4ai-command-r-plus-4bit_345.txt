SUMMARY: 
In his CPAC 2010 speech, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded ideological purity from the Republican Party, urging them to admit their problems with spending and big government. Beck's address, which intertwined his personal story of struggle and redemption, railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare. He criticized unnamed Republican lawmakers for admiring progressive policies and demanded a "Come-To-Jesus moment" and an apology from the party. Beck's message, delivered with his signature hand gestures and impersonations, captivated the CPAC audience. He rejected the notion of a "big tent," arguing that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or a clown show. Instead of broadening their appeal, Beck urged the GOP to undergo a 12-step program of recovery, admitting their addiction to spending and big government. The speech, which lasted nearly an hour, emphasized the need for conservatism to succeed and for the party to have their own house in order before seeking governance again.
