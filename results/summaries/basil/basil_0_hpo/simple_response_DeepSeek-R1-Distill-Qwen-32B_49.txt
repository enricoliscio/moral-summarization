Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

Glenn Beck is a conservative talk show host. He gave a speech at CPAC, a conservative conference. The main points of his speech were about the Republican Party needing to clean up their act before trying to govern again. He criticized the party for not admitting their problems and pushed for ideological purity. He used personal anecdotes, like his struggle with alcoholism, to draw parallels to the party's need for a 12-step recovery program. He also mocked the idea of a "big tent" for the GOP, arguing that ideological purity is more important than broadening their appeal.

The article contrasts this with traditional political strategies, where parties out of power try to expand their coalition. Beck, however, emphasized that the GOP should focus on being pure in their ideology rather than trying to appeal to a wider audience. He criticized Democrats and Progressivism, saying it's eating away at the Constitution. He also mentioned Dick Cheney's optimism for conservative ideas but added that just not being as bad as the other side isn't enough.

I need to make sure the summary captures Beck's main arguments: the need for Republican self-correction, the rejection of a big tent strategy, and the moral imperative for ideological purity. I should also include his personal touch with the 12-step analogy and his criticism of Progressivism.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Beck and the event, then outline his main points, including the personal elements, the critique of the party, and the rejection of broadening the coalition. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it's concise but covers all key moral points.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to make sure it's clear and flows well, highlighting Beck's emphasis on purity and self-correction over expansion. Also, including his metaphor of the Republican Party needing a 12-step program ties in his personal story to the party's issues.

I think that's all. Time to put it together concisely.
