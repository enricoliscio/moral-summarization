SUMMARY: 

Glenn Beck's CPAC 2010 speech emphasized the need for Republicans to prioritize ideological purity over expanding their coalition. Beck argued that the party must acknowledge its own problems, particularly its addiction to spending and big government, rather than trying to appeal to a broader audience. He criticized the notion of a "big tent" approach, suggesting that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus. Beck's speech was personal, drawing from his own experiences as a recovering alcoholic and his lack of formal education. He urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step program of recovery, acknowledging their mistakes and committing to change. Beck's message was clear: supporting Democratic-like policies would no longer be tolerated within the Republican Party. The crowd was enthralled, but the question remains whether Beck's call for ideological purity is the right approach for the conservative movement.
