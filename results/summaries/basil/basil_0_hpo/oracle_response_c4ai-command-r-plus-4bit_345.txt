SUMMARY: In a captivating and winding speech at CPAC in 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded ideological purity and redemption from the Republican Party, urging them to embark on a 12-step program to recovery from their addiction to spending and big government. Beck's address, which intertwined his own personal struggles with his political beliefs, reflected on the supposed launch of the progressive movement by Teddy Roosevelt and railed against government handouts. He argued that the GOP needed to broaden its appeal not by creating a big tent, but by staying true to conservative ideas and succeeding where their ideological foes had failed. Beck's message, delivered with his signature hand gestures and impersonations, captivated the CPAC crowd with its call for a return to the founding principles of America as an idea that sets people free.
