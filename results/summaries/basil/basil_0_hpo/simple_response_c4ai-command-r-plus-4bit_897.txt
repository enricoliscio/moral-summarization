SUMMARY: Moralistic and puritan, Glenn Beck delivered a speech at CPAC in 2010 that called for ideological purity within the Republican Party. Beck demanded that Republicans get their own house in order and undergo a sort of moral redemption before attempting to govern again. He urged the GOP to admit its problems with spending and big government, drawing a parallel with his own struggle with alcoholism and recovery. Beck's message, intertwined with his personal story, captivated the CPAC crowd, who seemed to embrace his call for ideological purity as the path to success for the conservative movement. This was in stark contrast to the traditional approach of expanding the coalition to win elections. Beck's speech, with its emphasis on moral framing and personal redemption, reflected a desire for a Republican Party that was true to its conservative ideals and free from the influence of the Democratic agenda.
