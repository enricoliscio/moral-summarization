SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at the CPAC conference, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck argued that the party needs to get its own house in order before trying to govern again, and that supporting Democratic-like policies will no longer be tolerated. He used personal anecdotes, including his struggles with addiction and lack of formal education, to drive home his points. Beck criticized the idea of a "big tent" approach, saying that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus. He also took swipes at Democrats, calling progressivism a threat to the Constitution. The crowd was captivated by Beck's speech, which was part policy lecture, part personal testimony. Overall, Beck's message was one of conservative purity and redemption.
