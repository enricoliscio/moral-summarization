SUMMARY:
In his speech at CPAC in 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded ideological purity and redemption for the Republican Party. Beck urged the party to recognize its "addiction to spending and big government" and embark on a path of recovery and ideological purity. He rejected the notion of a "big tent," arguing that America is an idea, not a circus or a clown show. Instead, he called for a return to conservative principles and a rejection of progressive policies that he believed threatened the Constitution. Beck's message was clear: the Republican Party must admit its flaws and undergo a transformation, offering an apology for its past actions and committing to a more principled future. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare, emphasizing personal responsibility and limited government. Beck's speech, intertwining his own story of struggle, captivated the CPAC audience and presented a vision for a morally upright and ideologically consistent conservative movement. END OF SUMMARY.
