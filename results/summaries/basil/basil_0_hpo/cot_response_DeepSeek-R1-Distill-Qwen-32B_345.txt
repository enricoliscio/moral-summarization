Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010 and specific instructions on how to process it. The task has two main steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. I'll read through each sentence carefully. Words like "progressivism," "eating," "Constitution," "purity," "sucked," "problem," "Come-To-Jesus," "tax," "spend," "addicted," "recovery," "handouts," "right," "freedom," "big tent," "circus," and "idea" stand out as they have strong moral or evaluative meanings. I'll list each of these with an asterisk.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: Beck's call for Republican purity, his criticism of Democrats, the 12-step analogy, his personal story, and the rejection of a "big tent" approach. I'll weave these points together, ensuring the moral terms are included to preserve the author's framing.

I should make sure the summary flows naturally and captures the essence of Beck's message without getting bogged down in details. It's important to highlight his demand for ideological purity and his rejection of expanding the party's base, emphasizing the moral imperative he presented.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to start with Beck's speech, move into his criticisms and personal analogies, and conclude with the implications for the Republican Party. Keeping it concise while preserving the moral elements is key.

**STEP 1:**  
* Progressivism  
* eating  
* Constitution  
* purity  
* sucked  
* problem  
* Come-To-Jesus  
* tax  
* spend  
* addicted  
* recovery

**SUMMARY:**  
Glenn Beck, in a fiery speech at CPAC 2010, demanded ideological purity within the Republican Party, criticizing its failure to address its "problem" of addiction to spending and big government. He accused progressivism of "eating" the Constitution and urged the GOP to reject policies resembling the Democratic agenda. Beck, drawing parallels to his own struggle with alcoholism, called for a 12-step recovery program, declaring, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I got a problem." He mocked the idea of a "big tent" approach, likening it to a circus, and emphasized that America is an "idea" rooted in freedom, not a political spectacle. His message to conservatives was clear: reject compromise and embrace a return to core principles. END OF SUMMARY.
