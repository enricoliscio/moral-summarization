SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck argued that "progressivism is eating the Constitution" and that the GOP needs to "succeed" by adhering to conservative principles. He criticized Republicans for being "addicted to spending and big government" and called for a "12-step program of recovery" to overcome these vices. Beck's message was clear: supporting Democratic agendas would no longer be tolerated within the GOP. He warned that the party needed to embark on a path of redemption and recovery, rather than trying to "broaden their appeal" by compromising on their values. Beck's speech was a call to action, urging Republicans to stand firm on their principles and reject the notion that they need a "big tent" to win elections. Instead, he emphasized that America is an "idea that sets people free," and that this idea should be the guiding force behind the GOP's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
