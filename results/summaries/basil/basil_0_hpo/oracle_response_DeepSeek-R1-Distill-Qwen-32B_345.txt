Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. The author used certain words like "eating," "purity," "succeed," "launching," "embark," "addicted," "broaden," "show," "circus," and "free." I should make sure to include as many of these as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Beck is talking about Republicans needing to clean up their act before trying to govern again. He criticized progressivism for "eating" the Constitution and emphasized the need for ideological purity within the GOP. He compared the party to his own 12-step recovery program, saying they're "addicted" to spending and big government. He also mocked the idea of a "big tent" approach, calling it a "circus" and stating that America is an idea meant to "set people free."

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Beck's demand for Republicans to get their house in order. Then, I'll note his criticism of progressivism "eating" the Constitution and his emphasis on purity. I'll include his 12-step analogy, the addiction to spending, and his rejection of a big tent, calling it a circus. Finally, I'll end with his statement about America being an idea that sets people free.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral terms. Let me check the word count as I go. I think I've covered all the main points and included the necessary moral language. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, in his 2010 CPAC speech, demanded Republicans prioritize ideological purity and governance over broadening their coalition. He criticized progressivism for "eating" the Constitution and urged conservatives to "succeed" by rejecting policies resembling the Democratic agenda. Beck emphasized the need for a "Come-To-Jesus moment" within the GOP, likening their addiction to spending and big government to his own recovery from alcoholism. He mocked the idea of a "big tent," calling it a "circus," and asserted that America is not a clown show but an idea meant to "set people free." His message was clear: conservatism must focus on its core values to achieve redemption and recovery, rejecting the notion of compromise for the sake of power. END OF SUMMARY.
