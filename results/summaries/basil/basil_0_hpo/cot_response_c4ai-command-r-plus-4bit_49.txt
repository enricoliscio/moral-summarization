SUMMARY: 
In a rousing speech at CPAC in 2010, conservative commentator Glenn Beck demanded that Republicans achieve purity within their own ranks before seeking to govern again. Beck intertwined his personal story of struggle and redemption with his political message, calling for the Republican Party to admit its problems with spending and big government. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare, reflecting his belief that America is an idea that sets people free. Beck's message stood out for its insistence on ideological purity as the path to redemption for the conservative movement, rather than the traditional approach of expanding the coalition to win elections. He urged the GOP to undergo a 12-step program of recovery, demanding a Come-To-Jesus moment from Republicans. Beck's address captivated the CPAC audience, who enthralled to his every word, impersonation, and chalkboard drawing.
