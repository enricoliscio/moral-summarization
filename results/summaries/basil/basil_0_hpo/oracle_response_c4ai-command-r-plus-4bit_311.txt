SUMMARY: Bombastic conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a captivating and winding speech at CPAC in 2010, demanding purity and success for the Republican Party. Beck urged the GOP to admit its problems with spending and big government, comparing it to his own struggle with alcoholism and a 12-step recovery program. He railed against government handouts and progressivism, accusing it of eating the Constitution. Beck's message was clear: no more Democratic agenda. He called for ideological purity and a return to conservative principles, rejecting the idea of a big tent, instead likening America to an idea that sets people free. The speech, intertwined with Beck's personal story of redemption, captivated the CPAC crowd and offered a path to redemption for the conservative movement. But did it offer a realistic path to electoral success? END OF SUMMARY.
