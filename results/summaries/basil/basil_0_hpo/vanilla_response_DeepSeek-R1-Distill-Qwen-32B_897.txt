Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points. 

Glenn Beck is a conservative talk show host, and he gave a speech at the three-day conservative conference. He was closing the event, so his speech was probably significant. The article mentions that he used various tools like hand gestures, impersonations, and his chalkboard, which I think are his usual style. He criticized Democrats, calling progressivism a threat to the Constitution. But the main focus was on Republicans needing to clean up their own act before trying to govern again. 

He emphasized ideological purity within the GOP, which means they should stick strictly to their conservative principles. He criticized the idea of a "big tent" approach, which usually means trying to include a wide range of people to broaden the party's appeal. Beck, however, thinks that's not the way to go. Instead, he wants the party to focus on their core values and not dilute their message by trying to appeal to everyone. 

He also drew parallels between his personal struggles, like being a recovering alcoholic, to the Republican Party's need for a 12-step recovery program. That's an interesting analogy, showing he's trying to make the party's issues relatable. He wants them to admit their problems, like addiction to spending and big government, similar to how someone in recovery would admit their addiction. 

The article contrasts this with the traditional approach where parties try to expand their coalition when out of power. Beck and the CPAC crowd believe in purity over broad appeal. He also criticized Teddy Roosevelt and Progressivism, linking it to modern Democratic policies. 

I need to make sure the summary captures that Beck is pushing for internal reform and ideological purity, rejecting the big tent strategy. Also, his use of personal stories to make his points more impactful. 

Let me structure this: start with who, what, where, when. Then move into the main points of his speechâ€”criticizing progressivism, focusing on Republican purity, rejecting the big tent, and using personal analogies. Conclude with the significance of his message within the conservative movement.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and captures all key elements without getting bogged down in details.
