SUMMARY: In his keynote speech at CPAC 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck demanded that Republicans get their house in order and embrace ideological purity as the path to redemption and recovery. Beck, known for his bombastic style, used hand gestures, impersonations, and his infamous chalkboard to captivate the audience. He urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step program of recovery, admitting their addiction to spending and big government. Reflecting on his own struggles, Beck railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare. He also criticized the progressive movement, accusing it of eating away at the Constitution. Beck's message stood out for its demand that conservatism succeed and that the Republican Party admit its problems. He called for a rejection of anything resembling the Democratic agenda and urged the party to broaden its appeal, stating that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus. The crowd was enthralled by Beck's intertwining of personal stories and political commentary, but it remains to be seen if his message is what the conservative movement needs to hear to regain power.
