SUMMARY:
Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck demanded that Republicans get their own house in order, acknowledging that they have a problem with spending and big government. He argued that "progressivism" is eating the Constitution and that the GOP needs a "Come-To-Jesus moment" to admit their mistakes. Beck's speech was a call to redemption and recovery, using his own personal story of struggle and redemption as an example. He rejected the idea of a "big tent" and instead emphasized the importance of America as an idea that sets people free. Beck's message was clear: the GOP needs to focus on its core values rather than trying to appeal to a broader audience. END OF SUMMARY.
