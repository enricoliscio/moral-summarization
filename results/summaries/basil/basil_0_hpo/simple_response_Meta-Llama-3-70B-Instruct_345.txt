SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck emphasized that the party needs to get its own house in order before seeking governance, and that supporting Democratic-like agendas will no longer be tolerated. He argued that both parties are guilty of taxing and spending, and that the GOP needs to embark on a 12-step program of recovery from its addiction to big government and spending. Beck's speech was personal, drawing from his own experiences as a recovering alcoholic and his lack of formal education. He railed against government handouts and argued that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or clown show. Beck's message was clear: ideological purity is the path to redemption and recovery, and the GOP needs to prioritize its core values over trying to appeal to a broader audience.
