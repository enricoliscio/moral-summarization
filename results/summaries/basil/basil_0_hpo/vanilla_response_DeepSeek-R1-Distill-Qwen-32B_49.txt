Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Glenn Beck gave a speech closing the three-day conservative conference. He's a conservative talk show host. The speech was about Republicans needing to get their own house in order before trying to govern again. He talked a lot about personal turmoil and policies, using hand gestures, impersonations, and his chalkboard. He criticized Democrats, saying progressivism is eating the Constitution. But the main focus was on demanding purity within the Republican party.

He mentioned Dick Cheney saying it's a good year for conservative ideas but emphasized that just being better than the other side isn't enough. He criticized some Republicans, like John McCain for admiring Teddy Roosevelt, who he blames for the progressive movement. He wants Republicans to admit they have a problem and go through a 12-step program, comparing it to his own recovery from alcoholism.

He also talked about government handouts and opposed the idea of a right to healthcare. The crowd was captivated, even though the speech was winding. Beck argued against the idea of a "big tent" for the GOP, saying America is an idea, not a circus. The article ends by questioning if this message was what the conservative movement needed, since traditionally parties expand their coalition when out of power.

So, the summary needs to capture that Beck emphasized Republican unity and purity, criticized Democrats and some Republicans, used personal anecdotes, and rejected the big tent approach. It should be concise, under 200 words, and start with SUMMARY: and end with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include key points: the speech's main message, the call for purity, the criticism of progressivism, the 12-step analogy, and the rejection of a big tent strategy. Also, mention the captivated audience and the debate on whether this approach is effective.

Let me structure this into a few sentences, ensuring clarity and conciseness. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward.
