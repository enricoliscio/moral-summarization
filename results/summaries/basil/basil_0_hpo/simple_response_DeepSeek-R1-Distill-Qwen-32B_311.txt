Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010 is the focus here. He's addressing Republicans, emphasizing the need for ideological purity. He criticizes the party for not admitting their problems, comparing them to his own recovery journey. He uses personal anecdotes, like his alcoholism, to make a point about the party's need for a 12-step program. He's against big government and government handouts, even relating it to healthcare. He's critical of Democrats and Progressivism, saying it's eating the Constitution. He also mocks the idea of a "big tent" for the GOP, arguing that ideological purity is the path to success, not broadening their appeal.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words. I should capture the main ideas: Beck's demand for Republican self-correction, his personal story analogy, criticism of Progressivism, and rejection of a big tent strategy. I need to maintain the moral tone, highlighting the call for purity and the rejection of compromise.

I should structure the summary to first mention the event, then Beck's main arguments, using his personal analogy, his criticism of both parties, and his stance against a broad coalition. Keeping it concise and within the word limit is crucial. Let me draft this, ensuring all key points are included without unnecessary details.
