SUMMARY: 
Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a passionate speech at CPAC 2010, urging Republicans to get their house in order before seeking governance. Beck emphasized the need for ideological purity, warning that supporting Democratic-like agendas would no longer be tolerated. He declared that "progressivism is eating the Constitution" and that the GOP must embark on a 12-step program of recovery from its addiction to spending and big government. Beck's message was clear: the party must succeed by staying true to its core values, rather than trying to broaden its appeal by compromising its principles. He likened the GOP's current state to a circus, emphasizing that America is an idea that sets people free, not a show. Beck's speech was a call to action, demanding that Republicans take responsibility for their past mistakes and work towards redemption. By doing so, they can launch a new era of conservative governance that truly succeeds. END OF SUMMARY.
