SUMMARY: In a passionate and winding speech at CPAC in 2010, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck urged Republicans to focus on ideological purity and internal reform rather than simply opposing their Democratic rivals. Beck likened the Republican Party to an alcoholic in need of a 12-step program, admitting their addiction to spending and big government. He argued against government handouts and a right to healthcare, intertwining his personal story of struggle and redemption with his political beliefs. Beck's message stood out for demanding that conservatism succeed, not just that the other side fails. He called for a rejection of anything resembling the Democratic agenda and for a return to core conservative values, arguing that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus or a clown show. The speech captivated the CPAC audience with its blend of personal anecdotes, historical tales, and Beck's infamous chalkboard, all in service of his vision for a purified and reinvigorated GOP.
