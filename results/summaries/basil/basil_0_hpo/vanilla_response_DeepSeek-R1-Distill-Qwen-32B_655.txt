Alright, so I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host, gave a speech closing a three-day conference. He emphasized that Republicans need to get their own house in order before trying to govern again. His speech was long, almost an hour, and he used a lot of gestures, impersonations, and his chalkboard. He criticized Democrats, saying progressivism is eating the Constitution. But the main focus was on his party, the Republicans, urging them to be pure in their conservatism.

He mentioned Dick Cheney's comment that it's a good year for conservative ideas, but Beck added that it's not enough to just not be as bad as the other side. He criticized some Republicans for being too similar to Democrats, specifically mentioning John McCain and Teddy Roosevelt, accusing them of progressive ideas. He wanted Republicans to admit they have a problem and go through a 12-step recovery program, comparing it to his own struggle with alcoholism.

He also talked about government handouts and opposed the right to health care, tying it back to his lack of formal education. The crowd was captivated, even though his speech was winding. The article contrasts this with the usual strategy of expanding the party's coalition to win elections, but Beck and CPAC attendees preferred ideological purity over a big tent.

So, the main points are:
- Beck urged Republicans to focus on their own purity and fix their issues.
- He criticized progressivism and the Democrats but focused more on his party.
- He used personal struggles (alcoholism) to push for a 12-step recovery analogy for the GOP.
- He opposed government handouts and the "big tent" approach, emphasizing ideological purity instead.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include these key points. I'll start by mentioning the event, his main message, the criticism of progressivism, the focus on Republican purity, the 12-step analogy, his personal story, opposition to government handouts, and the rejection of the big tent strategy. I'll make sure it's concise and flows well.
