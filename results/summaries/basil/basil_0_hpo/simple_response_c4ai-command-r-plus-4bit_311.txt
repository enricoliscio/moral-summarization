SUMMARY: Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a rousing speech at CPAC 2010, demanding purity and ideological clarity from the Republican Party. Beck argued that the party needed to undergo a 12-step program of recovery, admitting its addiction to spending and big government. He criticized the notion of a "big tent," insisting that America is an idea, not a circus. Instead of broadening their appeal, Beck urged Republicans to embrace their conservative ideals and differentiate themselves from Democrats. He accused progressivism of devouring the Constitution and singled out former President Teddy Roosevelt as the initiator of the modern progressive movement. Beck's own struggles with alcoholism and lack of formal education were woven into the speech, adding a personal dimension to his call for the GOP to embrace fiscal responsibility and reject government handouts, including the notion of a right to healthcare. The address captivated the CPAC audience, but it remains to be seen if ideological purity will lead to electoral success for the Republican Party.
END OF SUMMARY.
