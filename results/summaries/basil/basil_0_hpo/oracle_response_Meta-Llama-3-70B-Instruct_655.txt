SUMMARY: Glenn Beck's CPAC 2010 speech emphasized the need for Republicans to get their own house in order before seeking governance. He demanded "purity" among his allies, warning that "progressivism" is "eating the Constitution" and was "designed to eat the Constitution." Beck urged the GOP to "embark" on a 12-step program of recovery, admitting their addiction to "spending and big government." He argued that ideological purity is the path to redemption and recovery, rather than trying to "broaden" their appeal. Beck's message was clear: supporting anything that closely resembles the Democratic agenda will no longer fly with the modern GOP. He warned that America is not a "circus" or a "show," but an "idea that sets people free." Beck's plea for the GOP to "succeed" and not just "not suck as much as the other side" was met with enthusiasm from the CPAC crowd. END OF SUMMARY.
