SUMMARY:

Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck delivered a speech at the CPAC conference, urging Republicans to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their coalition. Beck argued that the party needs to get its own house in order before trying to govern, and that supporting Democratic-like policies will no longer be tolerated. He used personal anecdotes, including his struggles with addiction and lack of formal education, to illustrate the importance of limited government and individual freedom. Beck criticized the idea of a "big tent" approach, saying that America is an idea that sets people free, not a circus. He also took swipes at Democrats, saying that progressivism is designed to eat away at the Constitution. The speech was well-received by the packed auditorium, but may not be the message the conservative movement needs to hear, as it emphasizes purity over electoral success.
