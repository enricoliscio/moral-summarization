Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC 2010. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

Glenn Beck is a conservative talk show host, and he gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The main idea is that he's urging the Republican Party to focus on ideological purity rather than trying to expand their base. He criticized the party for not admitting their problems and compared their situation to his own recovery from alcoholism, suggesting a 12-step program for the GOP.

He also criticized progressive policies, saying they're eroding the Constitution, and took jabs at Democrats and some Republicans, like John McCain and Teddy Roosevelt. Beck emphasized that Republicans shouldn't just be better than Democrats but should stand for their principles. He rejected the idea of a "big tent" approach, which is a common strategy for expanding political support, instead advocating for a more unified and pure conservative movement.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements: Beck's call for purity, the comparison to his personal recovery, the criticism of progressivism, and his rejection of the big tent strategy. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone from the original article.

I'll start by introducing Beck and the event, then move into his main points about the GOP needing to clean up their act, the personal analogy, and the rejection of the big tent. I'll also touch on his critique of both parties' spending habits. Finally, I'll conclude with the implication that ideological unity is key for success, as per the article's framing.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure all key points are included without exceeding the word limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the moral aspects he emphasized.
