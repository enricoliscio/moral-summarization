SUMMARY: Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck gave the keynote speech at CPAC 2010, demanding that Republicans focus on ideological purity and get their own house in order before seeking to govern again. Beck's speech, which lasted nearly an hour, touched on his personal struggles and policies, urging the GOP to undergo a 12-step program of recovery from its addiction to spending and big government. He railed against government handouts and argued against a right to healthcare, intertwining his message with tales of Calvin Coolidge and the Statue of Liberty. Beck's message of ideological purity stood in contrast to traditional political strategies of expanding coalitions to win elections. He argued that America is an idea, not a circus, and that Republicans need to have a "Come-To-Jesus" moment to truly represent conservative ideals. Beck's address, which captivated the CPAC audience, emphasized the need for the GOP to admit its problems and undergo a transformation to align with conservative values.
