SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry, struggling in the polls, has launched a new TV ad accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion." Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, claims that Obama's policies are attacking faith in America. In the ad, Perry vows to "end" Obama's war on religion and "fight" against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. He argues that it's wrong for gays to serve openly in the military while children can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry's campaign has focused on social issues, citing Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and his omission of God from a Thanksgiving speech as examples of the administration's "attacks" on traditional American values. Perry believes that Obama's directive to promote and protect gay rights abroad is "objectionable" and "wrong." Perry's ad concludes by stating that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
