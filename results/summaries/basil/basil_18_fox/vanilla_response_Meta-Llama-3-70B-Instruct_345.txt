SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and positioning himself as the GOP candidate who can defend faith in America. In the ad, Perry says he's not ashamed to admit he's a Christian and criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting religious expression in schools. Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, including gay marriage, and argues that Obama is attacking traditional American values. He cites examples such as Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and a presidential memorandum promoting gay rights abroad. Perry, a Methodist, has never shied away from his faith during the campaign and is appealing to evangelical voters. The ad ends with Perry claiming that faith made America strong and can make it strong again.
