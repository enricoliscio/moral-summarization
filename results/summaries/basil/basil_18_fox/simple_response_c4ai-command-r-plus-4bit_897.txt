SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry attempts to revive his campaign by launching a scathing attack on President Obama, accusing him of waging a "war on religion" and eroding the nation's moral fabric. Perry, a Methodist, unapologetically leverages his Christian faith to appeal to social conservatives, claiming that Obama's policies and actions, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military and omitting God from his Thanksgiving speech, are assaults on America's religious heritage. Perry promises to defend faith in America and fight against what he perceives as liberal attacks on traditional values. He condemns Obama's directive to promote gay rights globally through diplomacy and aid programs, asserting that it is wrong to use tax dollars to promote a lifestyle objectionable to many people of faith. Perry's aggressive moral stance, evident in his new ad "Strong," aims to boost his campaign by appealing to evangelical voters and those concerned with the alleged erosion of religious values in the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
