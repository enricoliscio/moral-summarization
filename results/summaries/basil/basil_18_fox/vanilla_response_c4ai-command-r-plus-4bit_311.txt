SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, seeking to boost his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, has released a new television ad in Iowa accusing President Obama of waging a "war on religion." The ad, titled "Strong," features Perry claiming that gays can serve openly in the military but children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry, a Methodist, has never been shy about his faith during the campaign and has previously released an ad in Iowa describing himself as a "man of faith." In recent statements, Perry has criticized Obama for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and for leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also takes issue with Obama's directive to promote and protect the rights of gays and lesbians abroad. He concludes the ad by saying, "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again."
