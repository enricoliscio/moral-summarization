Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Texas Governor Rick Perry is running ads claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." He's tying his faith to conservative social issues like gay marriage and traditional values. The ad mentions serving in the military, celebrating Christmas, and praying in schools, which are all morally charged terms.

I should start the summary by stating Perry's accusation of Obama's war on religion. Then, mention how Perry connects his faith to his stance on social issues. I'll include the specific examples he uses, like gays serving in the military and kids celebrating Christmas or praying in school. 

Next, I'll note that the ad is part of a strategy targeting evangelical voters in Iowa. I'll also mention the email statement where Perry criticizes Obama's administration for promoting gay rights through foreign aid, which he finds objectionable. 

I need to make sure to use words like serve, celebrate, pray, war, fight, attacks, promote, protect, etc. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the accusation, then the ad's content, the targeting of voters, and the criticism of Obama's policies.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the required tokens. I'll double-check to include all the key points and maintain the moral framing as per the author's original text.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry is accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion" in a new TV ad titled "Strong," claiming he is the GOP candidate to defend faith in America. Perry emphasizes his Christian identity and argues that it's problematic when gays can serve openly in the military but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He vows to end Obama's alleged war on religion and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. The ad, part of a state-wide buy in Iowa, ties Perry's faith to his conservative stance on social issues like gay marriage. Perry has criticized Obama for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and for omitting God in his Thanksgiving speech. In a recent email, Perry condemned Obama's administration for promoting gay rights through foreign aid, calling it objectionable and a violation of traditional American values. Perry, a Methodist, has consistently highlighted his faith throughout the campaign, appealing to evangelical voters. The ad concludes by asserting that faith made America strong and can do so again. END OF SUMMARY.
