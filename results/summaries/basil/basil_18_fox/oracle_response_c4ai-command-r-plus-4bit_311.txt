SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry launches a moral crusade against what he perceives as a "War on Religion" waged by President Obama. In a new TV ad titled "Strong," Perry asserts his Christian faith and criticizes the president for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting children's religious expression in schools. Perry pledges to defend faith in America and fight against what he sees as liberal assaults on traditional values. He condemns the Obama administration's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and its omission of God in official speeches. Perry, a Methodist, promises to end the alleged war on religion and protect Americans' religious heritage. He appeals to evangelical voters by presenting himself as a devout Christian and claims that faith will make America strong again. Perry's campaign strategy emphasizes social issues and portrays him as a defender of faith against perceived secular attacks.
