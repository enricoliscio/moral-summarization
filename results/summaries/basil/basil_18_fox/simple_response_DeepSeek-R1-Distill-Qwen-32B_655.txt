Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new ad attacking President Obama's policies. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article mentions that Perry is down in the polls and is launching an ad claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." The ad is titled "Strong" and is a statewide buy in Iowa. In the ad, Perry talks about being a Christian and criticizes policies like allowing gays in the military but restricting Christmas celebrations and prayer in schools. He also mentions Obama's actions on the Defense of Marriage Act and Thanksgiving speech, as well as the foreign aid memorandum regarding gay rights.

Perry's campaign is targeting social conservatives, highlighting these issues. He ends the ad by linking faith to America's strength. The summary needs to capture the moral arguments Perry is making against Obama, emphasizing the "War on Religion" narrative and his conservative stance on social issues.

I should make sure to include the key points: Perry's ad, the "War on Religion" claim, examples of policies he's criticizing, and his appeal to faith and traditional values. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing.

Let me structure this: Start with Perry's ad and the main claim. Then list the examples he uses, mention the target audience (social conservatives), and conclude with his message about faith making America strong. Keep the language clear and direct, preserving the moral stance against Obama's policies.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all necessary elements.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, trailing in polls, has launched a new TV ad titled "Strong," accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion." In the ad, Perry ties his Christian faith to conservative social policies, criticizing Obama for allowing gays in the military while restricting Christmas celebrations and prayer in schools. He argues Obama's administration is attacking traditional American values, citing examples like the Justice Department's stance on the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God in a Thanksgiving speech. Perry also condemns Obama's memorandum promoting gay rights in foreign aid, calling it an attack on people of faith. The ad, part of a statewide buy in Iowa, emphasizes Perry's faith and his commitment to defending religious heritage, ending with the message that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
