SUMMARY:
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is taking a stand against what he perceives as a "War on Religion" waged by President Obama. In a new TV ad, Perry asserts that he is not ashamed of his Christian faith and that it is wrong for gays to serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to end Obama's alleged war on religion and fight against liberal assaults on the religious heritage of the country. Perry, a Methodist, has consistently highlighted his faith during his campaign, particularly when appealing to evangelical voters. He criticizes Obama for various actions, such as the Justice Department's stance on the Defense of Marriage Act and the omission of God from his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also opposes Obama's directive to promote and protect the rights of gays and lesbians in foreign aid decisions, claiming that it attacks traditional American values. Perry believes that faith can make America strong again and intends to fight for it during his campaign.
