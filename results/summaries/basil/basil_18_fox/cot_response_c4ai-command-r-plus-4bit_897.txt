SUMMARY:
In a new TV ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry accuses President Obama of waging a "War on Religion," claiming that the President's policies are attacking the religious heritage of America. Perry, a Methodist, is not afraid to showcase his faith during his campaign, and he believes that faith can make America strong again. He criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry promises to fight against what he sees as liberal attacks on social conservative values, including Obama's directive to the Justice Department regarding the Defense of Marriage Act and the omission of God from his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also takes issue with Obama's memorandum instructing agencies to promote and protect the rights of gays and lesbians abroad. He believes that using tax dollars to promote a lifestyle that many Americans of faith find objectionable is wrong. The ad, titled "Strong," is aimed at shoring up support among evangelical voters in Iowa, where Perry has zeroed in on gay marriage and social issues. Perry's stance is clear: he sees faith as integral to America's strength and believes his presidency would defend it against what he perceives as attacks from the current administration.
