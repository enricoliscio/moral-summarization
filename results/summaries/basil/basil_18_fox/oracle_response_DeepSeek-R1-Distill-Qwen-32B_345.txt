Okay, so the user has provided a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They have given a specific news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's ad claiming a "War on Religion" by Obama. The user has also listed the morally framed words that the author used, which I need to preserve in the summary.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. Perry is running against Obama, using the "War on Religion" narrative. He's targeting social conservative issues, especially gay marriage and religious freedom. The ad is part of his campaign strategy in Iowa, aiming to connect with evangelical voters.

Next, I should identify the key morally framed words: war, faith, fight, attacks, wrong, promote, protect. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary without changing their moral connotation.

I'll start by summarizing the main action: Perry's ad. Then mention the "War on Religion" claim. Include the examples he uses, like gays in the military versus celebrating Christmas or praying in schools. Highlight his stance on defending faith and fighting against liberal attacks.

I should also note the specific issues he's targeting, such as Obama's stance on DOMA and the Thanksgiving speech. Mention the presidential memorandum about promoting gay rights, which Perry opposes, linking it to tax dollars promoting an objectionable lifestyle.

Finally, I'll conclude with Perry's Methodist background and his appeal to faith, ending with the ad's message that faith can make America strong again.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral terms are preserved. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the ad, then the claims, examples, and ending with his religious appeal.

Let me check the word count as I draft to make sure it's within the limit. Also, ensure that the summary captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry is running ads claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion," arguing that Obama's administration is attacking traditional American values and religious heritage. In his new ad titled "Strong," Perry ties his Christian faith to his conservative stance on social issues, such as gay marriage and religious freedom in schools. He criticizes Obama for promoting a "lifestyle many Americans of faith find deeply objectionable," referencing Obama's memorandum directing U.S. agencies to promote and protect gay rights abroad. Perry also highlights Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech as examples of liberal attacks on faith. The ad, part of a state-wide buy in Iowa, ends with Perry asserting that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. END OF SUMMARY.
