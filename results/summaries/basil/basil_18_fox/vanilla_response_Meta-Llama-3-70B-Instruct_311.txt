SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America if elected. In the ad, Perry says that as President, he will end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. He ties his Christian faith to his conservative stands on social issues, citing examples such as Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and promoting gay rights through foreign aid. Perry argues that these actions are out of touch with American values and an attack on people of faith. The ad, titled "Strong," ends with Perry saying that faith made America strong and can make it strong again. This is not the first time Perry has emphasized his faith in the campaign, having released an earlier ad describing himself as a "man of faith."
