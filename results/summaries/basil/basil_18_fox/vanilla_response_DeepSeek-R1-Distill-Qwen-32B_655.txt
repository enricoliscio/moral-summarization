Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying that Perry is down in the polls and is attacking Obama, claiming he's waging a "War on Religion." The ad is titled "Strong" and is a state-wide buy in Iowa. In the ad, Perry talks about being a Christian and criticizes Obama for allowing gays in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He says he'll end Obama's war on religion and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage.

Perry ties his faith to conservative stands on social issues like gay marriage. The campaign has released statements arguing Obama is attacking social conservative values. Examples include Obama's Justice Department not supporting DOMA and leaving God out of Thanksgiving speeches. 

In an email, Perry mentions Obama's administration considering foreign aid based on gay rights, calling it a war on traditional values. He refers to a presidential memorandum where Obama wants to promote gay rights through diplomacy. Perry is a Methodist and has emphasized his faith, especially targeting evangelical voters with another ad in Iowa. The ad ends with him saying faith made America strong and can do so again.

So, the summary should include Perry's ad, his claims about Obama's war on religion, examples of his criticisms, and his emphasis on faith. It should be concise, under 200 words, and structured clearly.

I'll start by mentioning Perry's new ad, his accusation against Obama, and the focus on social issues. Then, I'll include the examples he uses and his religious background. Finally, I'll note how the ad aims to appeal to evangelical voters by linking faith to strength.

Let me put that together concisely.
