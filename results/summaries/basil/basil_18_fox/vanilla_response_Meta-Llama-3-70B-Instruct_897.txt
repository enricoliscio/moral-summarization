SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new TV ad claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and positioning himself as the GOP candidate who can defend faith in America. In the ad, Perry states that he's not ashamed to admit he's a Christian and criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting religious expression in schools. Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, including gay marriage, and argues that Obama is attacking traditional American values. He cites examples such as Obama directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and promoting gay rights through foreign aid decisions. Perry, a Methodist, has emphasized his faith throughout his campaign, appealing to evangelical voters. The ad ends with Perry stating that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again."
