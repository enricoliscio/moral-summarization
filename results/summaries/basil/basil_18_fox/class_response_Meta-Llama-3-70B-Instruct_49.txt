SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry, struggling in the polls, has launched a new TV ad accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion." Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, claims that Obama's policies are an "attack" on faith in America. The ad, titled "Strong," argues that while gays can "serve" openly in the military, children are prohibited from "celebrating" Christmas or "praying" in school. Perry vows to "end" Obama's "war on religion" and "fight" against liberal "attacks" on America's religious heritage. He cites Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and a presidential memorandum promoting gay rights abroad as examples of the administration's "war" on traditional values. Perry's campaign has zeroed in on social issues, framing Obama's policies as "objectionable" to people of faith. Perry concludes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again.
