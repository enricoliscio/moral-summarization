Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the provided morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Texas Gov. Rick Perry's new ad where he accuses Obama of waging a "War on Religion." He ties his faith to conservative social issues, such as gay marriage. He mentions several examples like Obama's stance on DOMA and the Thanksgiving speech. The ad is part of his campaign to appeal to evangelical voters.

I need to identify the key points and ensure the summary includes the morally charged words: serve, celebrate, pray, end, war, fight, attacks, directing, out, aid, faith, promoting, objectionable, referring, promote, protect.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Perry's claims, his ad's focus, the specific examples he uses, and his appeal to faith. I'll make sure to incorporate the words naturally without forcing them, maintaining the moral tone of the original article.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise (under 200 words) and includes all the necessary elements. I'll check each sentence to see if it aligns with the moral framing and the required words.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry is running ads accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion," claiming he will defend faith in America. In his ad titled "Strong," Perry emphasizes his Christian beliefs and criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting kids from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He vows to end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. Perry ties his faith to conservative stances on issues like gay marriage, citing examples such as Obama directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God in his Thanksgiving speech. He also condemns Obama's foreign aid policies, which he claims promote gay rights, calling it objectionable to many Americans of faith. Perry, a Methodist, has consistently highlighted his faith in the campaign, appealing to evangelical voters. His ad concludes that faith made America strong and can do so again. END OF SUMMARY.
