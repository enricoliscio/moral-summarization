Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new ad attacking President Obama's policies, framing it as a "War on Religion." 

First, I should identify the key points. Perry is using his faith to appeal to conservative voters, especially evangelicals. He's criticizing Obama's stance on gay rights and other social issues, claiming it's attacking traditional values. The ad is part of his campaign strategy in Iowa.

I need to keep the moral tone, so I should highlight Perry's arguments about Obama's actions being against religious freedom and traditional values. Mention the specific examples like DOMA and the foreign aid memorandum. Also, note Perry's Methodist background and his appeal to faith as a strength for the country.

I should structure the summary to start with Perry's ad and his claims, then detail the criticisms, and conclude with his campaign focus on faith and social issues. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are included without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is running a new TV ad in Iowa, titled "Strong," claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion." Perry, a Methodist, ties his faith to conservative social stances, arguing that Obama's policies, such as promoting gay rights in foreign aid and ending the Defense of Marriage Act, attack traditional American values. He criticizes Obama for excluding God from public speeches and for investing tax dollars in promoting a lifestyle many Americans of faith oppose. Perry emphasizes his Christian identity and vows to defend religious heritage, asserting that faith made America strong and can do so again. His campaign is targeting evangelical voters by highlighting his religious beliefs and opposing Obama's perceived liberal attacks on social conservatism.  
END OF SUMMARY.
