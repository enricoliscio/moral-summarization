SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, "Strong," in which he claims President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vows to defend faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, ties his Christian faith to his conservative stands on social issues, particularly gay marriage. He argues that Obama's administration is attacking traditional American values by promoting gay rights abroad and not defending the Defense of Marriage Act. Perry's ad highlights the perceived hypocrisy of allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting religious expression in schools. He frames his campaign as a moral crusade, stating that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." By doing so, Perry is appealing to evangelical voters and positioning himself as a champion of religious freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
