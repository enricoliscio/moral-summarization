SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad in Iowa, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" in America. Perry, a Methodist, is positioning himself as a defender of faith, citing examples such as the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and the administration's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. He also criticizes Obama for directing foreign aid decisions to be based on gay rights, which Perry believes is an attack on traditional American values. The ad, titled "Strong," ends with Perry stating that faith made America strong and can do so again. This is part of Perry's strategy to appeal to social conservatives and evangelical voters, who are key to his campaign's success.
