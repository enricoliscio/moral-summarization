Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Gov. Rick Perry's new ad attacking President Obama. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used, so I should keep the morally charged words they listed. Let me go through the article again.

Perry is down in the polls and is launching an ad claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." He's positioning himself as the GOP candidate to defend faith in America. The ad mentions that he's a Christian and criticizes Obama for allowing gays in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He says he'll end Obama's war on religion and fight against liberal attacks on their religious heritage.

The ad is a state-wide buy in Iowa. Perry ties his faith to conservative social issues, especially gay marriage. The campaign points out Obama's actions like stopping the Justice Department from defending DOMA and leaving God out of Thanksgiving speeches. They also mention Obama's foreign aid policy promoting gay rights, which Perry calls objectionable.

Perry is a Methodist and has been open about his faith, appealing to evangelical voters. The ad ends by saying faith made America strong and can do so again.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: serve, celebrate, pray, end, war, fight, attacks, directing, out, aid, faith, promoting, objectionable, referring, promote, protect.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Perry's ad and his claim of a war on religion. Mention his Christian identity. Criticize Obama's policies on gays in the military vs. celebrating Christmas and prayer in schools. His promise to end the war and fight against attacks. Mention the ad's focus on Iowa. Discuss the campaign's arguments against Obama's actions, including DOMA and Thanksgiving speech. Highlight the foreign aid policy and Perry's objection. Conclude with his Methodist background and the ad's closing statement about faith making America strong.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, trailing in polls, has launched a new ad accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion," positioning himself as the GOP candidate to defend faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, emphasizes his Christian identity and criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting kids from celebrating Christmas or praying in schools. He vows to end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. The ad, titled "Strong," targets Iowa voters, highlighting Perry's conservative stance on social issues like gay marriage. The campaign argues Obama's actions, such as directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God from his Thanksgiving speech, reflect a broader assault on traditional values. Perry also condemns Obama's foreign aid policy, which promotes gay rights, calling it objectionable to many Americans of faith. The ad concludes by asserting that faith made America strong and can do so again. END OF SUMMARY.
