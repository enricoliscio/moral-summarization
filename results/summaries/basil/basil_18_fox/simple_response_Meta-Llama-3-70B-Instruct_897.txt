SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" in America. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that the President's policies are an attack on traditional American values and people of faith. He cites examples such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting religious expression in schools, and Obama's decision to promote gay rights through foreign aid decisions. Perry positions himself as a defender of faith, stating that he will end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. The ad is part of Perry's campaign to appeal to social conservatives and evangelical voters, emphasizing the importance of faith in American society. By framing Obama's policies as an attack on religion, Perry is appealing to voters who share his moral values and sense of righteousness.
