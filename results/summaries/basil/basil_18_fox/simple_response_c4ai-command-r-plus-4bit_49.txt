SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry is resorting to divisive and discriminatory tactics in a desperate attempt to boost his campaign. In a new TV ad, Perry claims that President Obama is waging a "war on religion" and paints himself as the defender of faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, shamelessly exploits religion to justify his bigoted stance against the LGBTQ+ community, going so far as to suggest that allowing gays to serve openly in the military is somehow detrimental to the country. He promises to end Obama's supposed "war" and fight against "liberal attacks" on conservative social values. Perry's campaign has also released statements accusing Obama of being "out of touch" with America's values and waging a war on people of faith. One such statement cites Obama's directive to promote and protect the rights of gays and lesbians abroad as an example of investing tax dollars in promoting an objectionable lifestyle. Perry's manipulative use of religion as a political tool is not only morally reprehensible but also a dangerous appeal to prejudice and intolerance. It is a blatant attempt to divide Americans and erode the foundations of an inclusive and diverse society.

END OF SUMMARY.
