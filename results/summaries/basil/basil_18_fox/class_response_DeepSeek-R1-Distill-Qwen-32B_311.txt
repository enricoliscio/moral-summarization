Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. The user provided a detailed news piece about Texas Gov. Rick Perry's ad attacking Obama's policies on religion. They also listed specific morally charged words that need to be included.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. Perry is running ads claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." He's highlighting issues like gays serving in the military, celebrating Christmas, and praying in schools. He's tying his faith to conservative social stances, particularly on gay marriage and other social issues. He's using examples like Obama's Justice Department stance on the Defense of Marriage Act and the Thanksgiving speech without God. He's also criticizing Obama's foreign aid memorandum promoting gay rights.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. The words are: serve, celebrate, pray, end, war, fight, attacks, directing, out, aid, faith, promoting, objectionable, referring, promote, protect.

I should start by identifying the key elements from the article that use these words. The ad mentions serving openly in the military, celebrating Christmas, praying in school. Perry wants to end Obama's war on religion, so "end" is important. He's fighting against liberal attacks on religious heritage. He's directing the Justice Department, and Obama is out of touch. The foreign aid is promoting gay rights, which some find objectionable. The ad refers to faith making America strong.

I need to structure the summary to include these elements concisely. I'll mention the ad's title, the main claims, the specific examples Perry uses, and the conclusion about faith. I have to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating the moral language.

I should also note that Perry is a Methodist and hasn't shied away from his faith, emphasizing his appeal to evangelical voters. The ad ends with the strong message about faith making America strong again.

Putting it all together, I'll start with the ad's release, Perry's claims, the examples he uses, the foreign aid criticism, and conclude with the faith message. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate without forcing them in.

Let me draft this step by step. First, introduce the ad and its purpose. Then list the issues Perry is addressing, using the specific words. Mention the Justice Department and Thanksgiving speech examples. Then discuss the foreign aid memorandum and Perry's criticism. Finally, wrap up with his Methodist background and the ad's closing statement.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine some sentences and ensure each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll also check that the moral framing words are naturally integrated into the summary.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all the required words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad titled "Strong," claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion." Perry asserts that Obama's policies, such as directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God from his Thanksgiving speech, attack traditional American values. He criticizes Obama's recent memorandum promoting gay rights through foreign aid, calling it "objectionable" and a misuse of tax dollars. Perry, a Methodist, ties his faith to his conservative stance on social issues, including gay marriage. In the ad, he vows to "end" Obama's war on religion and "fight" against liberal attacks on religious heritage. Perry emphasizes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. His campaign has targeted evangelical voters, highlighting his identity as a "man of faith." END OF SUMMARY.
