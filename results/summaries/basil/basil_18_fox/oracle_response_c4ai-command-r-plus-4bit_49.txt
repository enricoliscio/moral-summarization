SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a moral crusade, accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion" in a new TV ad. Perry, a Methodist, is unapologetic about his faith and believes that the current administration is attacking the religious heritage of America. He criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting children from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. Perry vows to end this alleged war and fight against what he perceives as liberal assaults on social conservative values. He condemns Obama's directive to the Justice Department regarding the Defense of Marriage Act and his omission of God from his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also takes issue with a presidential memorandum promoting gay rights in foreign aid decisions. The ad, titled "Strong," emphasizes his belief that faith is what made America strong and can continue to strengthen it. Perry is appealing to evangelical voters, positioning himself as a defender of faith against what he sees as immoral policies.
END OF SUMMARY.
