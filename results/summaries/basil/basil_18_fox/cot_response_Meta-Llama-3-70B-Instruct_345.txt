SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and attacking America's "traditional values". Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that Obama's policies, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military, are an affront to faith and morality. He vows to "end Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage". Perry's ad, titled "Strong", ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, including gay marriage. He criticizes Obama for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and for promoting gay rights through foreign aid. Perry believes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. His campaign is appealing to evangelical voters, framing Obama's policies as a threat to America's moral fabric. END OF SUMMARY.
