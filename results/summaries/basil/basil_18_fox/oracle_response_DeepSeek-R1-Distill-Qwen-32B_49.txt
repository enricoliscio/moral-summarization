Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article about Texas Gov. Rick Perry's ad attacking President Obama. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. They listed specific words like "war," "faith," "fight," "attacks," "wrong," "promote," and "protect." I should make sure to include these words as much as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Perry is running ads claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." He's emphasizing his Christian faith and contrasting it with Obama's policies on gay rights and religious expressions in schools. The ad is part of a strategy targeting social conservatives, especially in Iowa.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key morally charged words. So, I'll mention the "war on religion," his "faith," the "fight" against liberal attacks, and how he's "attacking" Obama's policies. I should also include terms like "wrong" when talking about Obama's actions and "promote" and "protect" regarding the memorandum on gay rights.

I should structure the summary to start with Perry's ad, his claims about Obama's war, his religious stance, and then the specific examples he uses. I'll also note the ad's target audience and how it ties into his campaign strategy.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, highlighting the moral framing without getting too detailed. Let me piece it together, ensuring all the key points and moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry is running a new TV ad titled "Strong," claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion." Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and accuses Obama of attacking traditional American values, including religious expression in schools and opposition to gay marriage. He argues that Obama's administration is "fighting" against faith by promoting policies like gay rights in foreign aid, which Perry deems "wrong" and contrary to the beliefs of many Americans. Perry ties his conservative stance on social issues to his faith, asserting that as president, he would "end Obama's war on religion" and "protect" the religious heritage of the country. The ad, part of a state-wide buy in Iowa, aims to appeal to evangelical voters by highlighting Perry's identity as a "man of faith" and his commitment to using "faith" to "make America strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
