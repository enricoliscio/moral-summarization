SUMMARY: In a new TV ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry accuses President Obama of waging a "war on religion" and pledges to defend faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, has made his faith a central part of his campaign, releasing ads in Iowa that highlight his religious beliefs and conservative social values. He criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry also takes issue with Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and his omission of God from a recent Thanksgiving speech. Perry promises to end what he sees as an attack on traditional American values and religious heritage, stating that faith can make America strong again. Perry's appeal to evangelical voters and his stance against gay rights highlight a moral framework that values conservative social issues and religious expression over the rights and inclusion of LGBT individuals.
