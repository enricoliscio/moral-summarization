SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad in Iowa, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America. In the ad, Perry says that as President, he will end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. Perry, a Methodist, has been open about his faith during the campaign and has tied it to his conservative stands on social issues. The ad focuses on issues such as gay marriage, with Perry arguing that Obama is attacking traditional American values. Perry cites examples such as Obama's directive to promote gay rights abroad and his decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. The ad ends with Perry saying that faith made America strong and can make it strong again. The ad is part of Perry's efforts to appeal to evangelical voters in Iowa.
