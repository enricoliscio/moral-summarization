SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, titled "Strong", in which he claims President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vows to "end" it as President. Perry, a Methodist, is not ashamed to admit his Christian faith and believes it's essential to defend faith in America. He argues that Obama's administration is "directing" attacks on traditional American values, citing examples such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting prayer in schools and celebration of Christmas. Perry also criticizes Obama's decision to "promote and protect" gay rights through foreign aid, which he finds "objectionable" and a waste of tax dollars. The ad ends with Perry stating that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." By framing his campaign around faith and social issues, Perry is appealing to evangelical voters and positioning himself as a champion of religious heritage.
