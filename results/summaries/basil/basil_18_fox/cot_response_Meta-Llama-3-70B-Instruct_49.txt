SUMMARY:
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and attacking America's traditional values. Perry, a Methodist, is not ashamed to admit his Christian faith and vows to defend it as President. He argues that under Obama, gays can serve openly in the military, but kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school, which is "wrong." Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, such as gay marriage, and accuses Obama of being "out of touch" with America's values. He criticizes Obama's directive to promote gay rights abroad, calling it an "administration at war with people of faith." Perry's ad, titled "Strong," ends with the message that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
