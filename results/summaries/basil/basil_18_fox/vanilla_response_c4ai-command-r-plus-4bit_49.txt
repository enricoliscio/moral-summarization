SUMMARY: Texas Governor Rick Perry, in a bid to boost his poll numbers, has released a new TV ad in Iowa accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion." Perry, a Methodist, has long incorporated his faith into his campaign and has recently focused on social issues such as gay marriage. In the ad, titled "Strong," Perry claims that Obama's policies, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while not mentioning God in his Thanksgiving speech, are attacks on religious heritage and traditional American values. Perry pledges to end Obama's supposed war on religion and protect faith in America. The ad is part of a targeted appeal to evangelical voters in Iowa, where Perry has previously described himself as a "man of faith." Perry concludes the ad by stating that faith made America strong and can do so again.
END OF SUMMARY.
