SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry, struggling in the polls, has launched a new TV ad accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion" in America. Perry, a Methodist, claims that as President, he will defend faith and end Obama's alleged attacks on religious heritage. The ad highlights Perry's conservative stance on social issues, such as gay marriage, and criticizes Obama's decisions, including directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and promoting gay rights through foreign aid. Perry argues that these actions are out of touch with America's values and an affront to people of faith. The ad concludes with Perry stating that faith made America strong and can do so again.
