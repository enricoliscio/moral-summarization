Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Gov. Rick Perry's new ad attacking President Obama. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about Perry claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." I should make sure to include that phrase to keep the moral tone.

Perry's ad mentions issues like gays serving in the military versus kids celebrating Christmas or praying in school. That's a contrast he's using to highlight what he sees as an unfair situation. I need to capture that contrast in the summary. Also, he ties his faith to his conservative stance on social issues, especially gay marriage. That's important for the moral framing.

The ad is part of a strategy targeting evangelical voters, especially in Iowa. I should note that it's a state-wide buy in Iowa starting Wednesday. The arguments Perry uses include Obama's actions like stopping the Justice Department from defending DOMA and leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech. These are specific points that show Perry's perspective on Obama's policies.

He also mentions a presidential memorandum promoting gay rights in foreign aid, which Perry argues is against traditional American values. Ending with the idea that faith made America strong and can do so again ties back to the moral and patriotic angle.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it: start with Perry's ad, his claims, the examples he uses, his targeting of evangelical voters, and the closing statement about faith and strength. Make sure to include the key phrases and the moral arguments he's making against Obama.
