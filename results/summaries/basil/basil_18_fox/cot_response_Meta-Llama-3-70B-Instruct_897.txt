SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Rick Perry is fighting back in the polls with a new TV ad, accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion" and claiming he's the GOP candidate who can defend faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, proudly declares he's not "ashamed" to admit he's a Christian and vows to end Obama's "war on religion" as President. He argues that Obama's policies, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military but restricting prayer in school, are "wrong" and an attack on traditional American "values". Perry's campaign has zeroed in on gay marriage and social issues, accusing Obama of being "out of touch" with America's values. The ad ends with Perry claiming, "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again.‚Äù END OF SUMMARY.
