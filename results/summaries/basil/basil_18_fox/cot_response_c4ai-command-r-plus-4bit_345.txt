SUMMARY:
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is taking a stand against what he perceives as a "War on Religion" waged by President Obama. In a new TV ad, Perry asserts that he is not ashamed to be a Christian and that there is something *wrong* with a country where gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry pledges to end Obama's supposed *war* on religion and to combat *attacks* on the religious heritage of America. Perry, a Methodist, has consistently highlighted his faith during his campaign, particularly when appealing to evangelical voters. He criticizes Obama for various actions, such as excluding God from his Thanksgiving speech and promoting gay rights in foreign aid decisions, which Perry believes are *out of touch* with America's values. Perry concludes his ad with the statement that faith *made* America strong and it can do so again.
