Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new TV ad attacking President Obama's policies. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by saying Perry is down in the polls and is now on the attack. His ad claims Obama is waging a "War on Religion." Perry is positioning himself as the GOP candidate to defend faith in America. In the ad, he mentions being a Christian and criticizes Obama for allowing gays in the military but not letting kids celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He vows to end Obama's war on religion and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage.

The ad is a state-wide buy in Iowa starting Wednesday. Perry ties his faith to conservative social issues, focusing on gay marriage and other social issues. The campaign has released several statements arguing that Obama is attacking social conservative values. Examples include Obama's Justice Department not defending the Defense of Marriage Act and leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech.

Perry also mentions a presidential memorandum where Obama directs agencies to promote gay rights in foreign aid, which Perry sees as wrong because it invests tax dollars in a lifestyle many Americans of faith oppose. He's a Methodist and hasn't hidden his faith, previously appealing to evangelical voters with another ad in Iowa. The latest ad ends with him saying faith made America strong and can do so again.

So, to summarize, I need to include that Perry is attacking Obama, claiming a war on religion, focusing on social issues like gay marriage and prayer in schools, using examples like Obama's policies on DOMA and foreign aid, and positioning himself as a religious leader to appeal to conservatives.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Make sure to mention the ad's title, the key criticisms, and Perry's religious stance. Also, note that the ad is in Iowa and part of his campaign strategy targeting social conservatives.

Let me structure it: Start with Perry's ad and his claims, then the examples he uses, and conclude with his appeal to faith and strength. Make sure to hit all the main points without getting too detailed.
