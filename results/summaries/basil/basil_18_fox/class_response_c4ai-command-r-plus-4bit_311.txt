SUMMARY: In a new TV ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry accuses President Obama of waging a "war on religion," appealing to social conservatives by tying his own faith to his conservative stands on social issues. Perry, a Methodist, has never been shy about his religious beliefs during his campaign. He claims that Obama's policies, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while not allowing children to openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school, are attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry also criticizes Obama for leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech and for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. Perry promises to "end Obama's war on religion" and fight against what he sees as liberal attacks on faith in America, stating that faith can make America strong again. Perry's campaign is focusing on gay marriage and social issues, with statements claiming that Obama's administration is promoting a lifestyle that many Americans of faith find objectionable. Perry refers to a presidential memorandum in which Obama directed agencies to "promote and protect" gay and lesbian rights abroad, which Perry sees as another example of the administration's disregard for traditional values.
