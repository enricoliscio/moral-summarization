SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry is resorting to divisive and discriminatory tactics in a desperate attempt to boost his campaign. In a new TV ad, Perry claims that President Obama is waging a "war on religion," exploiting religious sentiment to further his own political agenda. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, shamelessly asserts that gays serving openly in the military is an affront to religious values, blatantly ignoring the separation of church and state. He promises to fight against "liberal attacks" on religious heritage, implying that respecting the rights of the LGBTQ+ community is somehow detrimental to faith. Perry also criticizes Obama for his inclusive stance on foreign aid, opposing the protection of gay rights abroad. By invoking faith as a tool for political gain, Perry's ad is a disturbing reflection of his moral compass, prioritizing religious dogma over human rights and equality. His assertion that faith can be used to discriminate and exclude is a dangerous message that undermines the very values of tolerance and freedom that America stands for. END OF SUMMARY.
