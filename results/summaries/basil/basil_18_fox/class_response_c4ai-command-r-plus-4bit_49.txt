SUMMARY: In a new TV ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry accuses President Obama of waging a "war on religion" and pledges to defend faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, is not afraid to showcase his faith during his campaign. He claims that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry promises to fight against what he sees as liberal attacks on religious heritage and social conservative values. He criticizes Obama for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and for leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also opposes Obama's memorandum instructing agencies to promote and protect the rights of gays and lesbians abroad, stating that promoting a lifestyle many Americans of faith find objectionable is wrong. Perry believes that faith can make America strong again and is not ashamed to be a Christian. He is making a direct appeal to evangelical voters in Iowa with his stance on social issues and emphasis on his religious beliefs.
