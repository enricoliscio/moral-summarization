Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new TV ad. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems Perry is attacking Obama, claiming he's waging a "War on Religion." The ad is titled "Strong" and is airing statewide in Iowa. 

Perry's main arguments are about Obama's policies affecting religious freedoms, like gay marriage and celebrating Christmas in schools. He mentions specific examples, such as Obama's Justice Department not defending the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God in a Thanksgiving speech. 

Also, Perry is a Methodist and has been open about his faith, targeting evangelical voters. The ad ends by linking faith to making America strong again.

I need to condense all this into a clear, concise summary. I'll start by stating Perry's attack on Obama, mention the ad's title and target state. Then outline the main issues he's highlighting, the examples he uses, and his religious background. Finally, I'll note how the ad ties faith to national strength.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is concise and covers the essential points without extra details. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all key elements are included without being too wordy.
