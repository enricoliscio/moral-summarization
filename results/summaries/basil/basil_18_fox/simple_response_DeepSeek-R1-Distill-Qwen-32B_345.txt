Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to focus on the ethical aspects presented.

Looking at the article, it's about Rick Perry attacking Obama's policies as a "War on Religion." I need to highlight Perry's claims and the moral arguments he's making. He's tying his faith to his conservative stance, especially on issues like gay marriage and religious expression in schools.

I should include the ad details, the examples he uses, and his Methodist background. Also, the ad's goal is to appeal to evangelical voters in Iowa. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me structure it: start with Perry's ad and his main accusation, then mention the examples he provides, his religious background, and the ad's purpose. Make sure it's all within the word limit and flows well.

SUMMARY:  
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion," positioning himself as the GOP candidate to defend faith in America. In the ad, Perry ties his Christian identity to conservative social values, arguing that Obama's policies, such as ending Defense of Marriage Act enforcement and promoting gay rights in foreign aid, attack traditional American values and religious heritage. Perry emphasizes his commitment to protecting religious freedom, citing examples like Obama omitting God from a Thanksgiving speech and advocating for LGBTQ+ rights. He argues that such actions alienate people of faith and undermine America's moral foundation. As a Methodist, Perry has consistently highlighted his faith throughout the campaign, including an earlier ad appealing to evangelical voters in Iowa. His latest ad, "Strong," ends with the message that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
