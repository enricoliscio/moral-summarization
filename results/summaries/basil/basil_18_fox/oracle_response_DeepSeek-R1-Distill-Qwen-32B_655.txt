Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

Rick Perry is running against Obama, claiming there's a "War on Religion." He's using his faith to connect with voters, especially conservatives. The ad mentions issues like gay marriage and religious practices in schools. He's highlighting Obama's actions, like ending support for DOMA and omitting God in speeches, as attacks on traditional values. The user wants the summary to include the specific morally charged words: war, faith, fight, attacks, wrong, promote, protect.

I need to make sure these words are included. I should structure the summary to show Perry's campaign strategy, his use of these terms, and the examples he provides. Also, mention the ad's focus on Iowa and his Methodist background.

Let me start by stating Perry's claim of a war on religion. Then, explain how he's using his faith to contrast with Obama's policies. Include the examples he gives, like DOMA and Thanksgiving speech. Make sure to use the required words naturally. Conclude with his argument that faith is key to making America strong again.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well. Let me draft it step by step, checking each point and the inclusion of the moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion," using his faith as a central theme in his campaign to appeal to social conservatives. In a new ad titled "Strong," Perry emphasizes his Christian identity and criticizes Obama for attacking traditional religious values. He cites examples such as Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God in his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also condemns Obama's recent memorandum directing U.S. agencies abroad to "promote and protect" gay rights, calling it an attack on the faith of many Americans. He argues that investing tax dollars to "promote" a lifestyle many find objectionable is "wrong." Perry ties his faith to his conservative stance on social issues, asserting that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. His campaign is focused on fighting liberal attacks on religious heritage, using morally charged language to rally support. END OF SUMMARY.
