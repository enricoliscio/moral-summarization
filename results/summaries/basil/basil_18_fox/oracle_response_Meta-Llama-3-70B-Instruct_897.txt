SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, "Strong," in which he accuses President Obama of waging a "War on Religion" and vows to defend faith in America. Perry, a Methodist, claims that Obama's policies are an "attack" on traditional American values, citing examples such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting religious expression in schools. Perry frames his conservative stance on social issues as a "fight" against liberal attacks on religious heritage. He criticizes Obama's directive to promote and protect gay rights abroad, calling it "wrong" and an example of the administration's "war" on people of faith. Perry's ad ends with the assertion that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." By using morally charged language, Perry is appealing to evangelical voters and positioning himself as a champion of religious values.
