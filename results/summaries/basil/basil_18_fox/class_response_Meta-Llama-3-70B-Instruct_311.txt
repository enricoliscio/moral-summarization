SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry, struggling in the polls, has launched a new TV ad claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America. In the ad, Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, attacks Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting prayer and Christmas celebrations in schools. Perry promises to "end" Obama's alleged "war on religion" and "fight" against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. He criticizes Obama for "directing" the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and for "leaving God out" of his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also opposes Obama's plan to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights, calling it a "war on traditional American values" that is "objectionable" to people of faith. Perry's ad concludes by stating that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. END OF SUMMARY.
