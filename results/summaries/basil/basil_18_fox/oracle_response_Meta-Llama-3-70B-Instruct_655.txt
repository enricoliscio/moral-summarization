SUMMARY:

Texas Gov. Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that Obama's policies are an "attack" on traditional American values, citing examples such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting prayer in school and celebration of Christmas. Perry promises to "fight" against these "liberal attacks" and "end" Obama's "war on religion" if elected President. He also criticizes Obama's directive to promote and protect gay rights abroad, calling it "wrong" and an example of the administration's "war" on people of faith. Perry's ad, titled "Strong," concludes by asserting that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." By framing his campaign around faith and morality, Perry aims to appeal to social conservatives and evangelical voters.
