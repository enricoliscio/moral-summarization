SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to "end" it as President. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that Obama's policies are an "attack" on traditional American values, citing examples such as allowing gays to "serve" openly in the military while restricting prayer and Christmas celebrations in schools. Perry's campaign has focused on social issues, including gay marriage, and has released statements accusing Obama of "directing" the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. Perry also objects to Obama's decision to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights, calling it "wrong" and an "attack" on people of faith. The ad, titled "Strong," concludes with Perry stating that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." Perry is positioning himself as a champion of faith and traditional values, vowing to "fight" against liberal "attacks" on America's religious heritage.
