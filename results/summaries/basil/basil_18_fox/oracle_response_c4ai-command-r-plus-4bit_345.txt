SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry is fighting back with a new TV ad accusing President Obama of waging a "war on religion." Perry, a Methodist, is not afraid to showcase his faith during his campaign. In the ad, titled "Strong," Perry claims that Obama is attacking the fundamental values of social conservatives and waging a war on religion by allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting children from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. Perry promises to "end Obama's war on religion" and defend faith in America. He criticizes Obama for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and for excluding God from his Thanksgiving speech. Perry also condemns the administration's decision to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights, calling it a "war on traditional American values." Perry believes that faith can make America strong again and is not ashamed to admit his Christian beliefs. He has released previous ads in Iowa, appealing to evangelical voters by highlighting his strong religious beliefs.
END OF SUMMARY.
