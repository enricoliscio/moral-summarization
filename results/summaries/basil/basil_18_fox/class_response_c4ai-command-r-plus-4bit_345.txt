SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry launches an attack ad accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion." Perry claims that Obama's policies, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while not supporting public celebration of Christmas or prayer in schools, are attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry promises to defend faith in America and end Obama's alleged war on religion as President. Perry, a Methodist, has made his faith a central part of his campaign, especially in appeals to evangelical voters. He criticizes Obama's support for gay rights and claims that the administration's decision to base foreign aid on gay rights promotion is "objectionable." Perry's ad, titled "Strong," concludes with the statement, "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." Perry's campaign strategy emphasizes his conservative social views and portrays him as a defender of faith against liberal attacks.
