Okay, so the user is asking me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the morally framed words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new ad claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." He's targeting social conservative issues, like gay marriage and religious expression in schools. The ad is part of his campaign strategy to appeal to evangelical voters.

Now, for the first step, I have to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "attack," "waging," "war on religion," "ashamed," "Christian," "gays," "serving openly," "celebrate Christmas," "pray," "fight," "liberal attacks," "religious heritage," "fundamental," "out of touch," "values," "foreign aid," "gay rights," "lifestyle," "objectionable," "wrong," "promote," "protect," "rights," and "strong." Each of these words is used to convey a moral stance or judgment.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of Perry's argument. I'll start by stating Perry's claim about Obama's war on religion. Then, mention the ad's focus on social issues like gay marriage and religious expression. Highlight the examples Perry uses, such as Obama's stance on DOMA and Thanksgiving speech. Conclude with Perry's Methodist background and his appeal to faith to strengthen America.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and retains the moral framing. I'll structure it to show Perry's campaign strategy and his arguments against Obama's policies, emphasizing the moral and religious angles.

Let me make sure I don't miss any key points. The ad is in Iowa, targeting evangelical voters. The memorandum on foreign aid and gay rights is another point. Perry's Methodist faith is important, as is his emphasis on faith making America strong.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Time to put it all together clearly and concisely.
