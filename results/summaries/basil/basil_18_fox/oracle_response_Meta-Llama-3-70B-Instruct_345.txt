SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, "Strong," in which he claims President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vows to defend faith in America. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's "wrong" that gays can serve openly in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to "fight against liberal attacks" on America's religious heritage and end Obama's "war on religion." Perry's campaign has focused on social issues like gay marriage, citing Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and his directive to promote and protect gay rights abroad as examples of the administration's "attacks" on traditional American values. Perry believes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again, framing his campaign as a moral crusade to protect America's values. END OF SUMMARY.
