SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Rick Perry is fighting back in the polls with a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and attacking traditional American values. Perry, a Methodist, proudly declares himself a Christian and vows to defend faith in America. He argues that it's "wrong" that gays can serve openly in the military but kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, citing Obama's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and his alleged omission of God in a Thanksgiving speech. Perry condemns Obama's administration for promoting a "lifestyle" that many Americans of faith find "objectionable" and for being "out of touch" with America's values. Perry's ad, "Strong," ends with the message that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
