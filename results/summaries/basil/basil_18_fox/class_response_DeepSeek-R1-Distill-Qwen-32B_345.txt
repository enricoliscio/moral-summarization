Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new ad attacking Obama's policies. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, so I should focus on the words the author used like "serve," "celebrate," "pray," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Perry is running ads claiming Obama is waging a "War on Religion." He's targeting social conservatives, especially in Iowa. The ad mentions gays serving in the military but kids not celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He ties his faith to his conservative stance on issues like gay marriage.

I need to include the morally charged words without making the summary too long. I should mention the ad's title, "Strong," and the state-wide buy in Iowa. Also, highlight specific examples Perry uses, like Obama's Thanksgiving speech and the foreign aid memo. 

I'll structure the summary to show Perry's campaign strategy: using faith to contrast with Obama's policies, emphasizing social issues and conservative values. Make sure to include all the key morally framed words as much as possible without forcing them in.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Perry's ad, then his claims about Obama, the specific examples, and conclude with his appeal to faith and strength. That should cover all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry is running a new TV ad titled "Strong," claiming President Obama is waging a "War on Religion." Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and vows to end Obama's alleged attacks on religious freedom, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting kids from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. The ad, a state-wide buy in Iowa, ties Perry's faith to his conservative stance on social issues, including gay marriage. Perry accuses Obama of directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and of omitting God from his Thanksgiving speech. He also refers to a presidential memorandum promoting gay rights in foreign aid, calling it objectionable and a misuse of tax dollars. Perry, a Methodist, appeals to evangelical voters by highlighting his faith and asserting that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
