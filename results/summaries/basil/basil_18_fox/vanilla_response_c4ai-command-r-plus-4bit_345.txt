SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a bid to boost his poll numbers, has released a new TV ad in Iowa accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion." Perry, a Methodist, has always been open about his faith during his campaign. The ad, titled "Strong," claims that Obama's policies, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while not allowing children to openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school, are attacks on religious freedom. Perry promises to end this alleged "war" and protect the religious heritage of the US if elected president. He also criticizes Obama for leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech and for directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. Perry's campaign has been focusing on gay marriage and social issues, appealing to key evangelical voters by positioning himself as a defender of faith and conservative social values. The ad ends with Perry stating that faith can make America strong again.
END OF SUMMARY.
