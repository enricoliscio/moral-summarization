Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want a concise yet accurate summary that reflects the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Governor Rick Perry is running against Obama, accusing him of a "War on Religion." The ad highlights social issues like gay marriage and religious expression in schools. Perry ties his Christian faith to his conservative policies and criticizes Obama's actions, like ending support for DOMA and promoting gay rights in foreign aid.

I need to make sure the summary includes Perry's accusations, his religious stance, and specific examples he uses. Also, the ad's purpose and target audience (Iowa evangelicals) are important. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Perry's accusation, mention the ad and its focus, list his criticisms, and conclude with his appeal to faith. Make sure to include the Methodist background and the ad's impact in Iowa.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all key elements without exceeding the word limit.

He argues that Obama's administration is promoting gay rights in foreign aid, which he deems offensive to many Americans of faith. Perry ties his conservative social policies to his faith, appealing to evangelical voters in Iowa. The ad highlights his commitment to defending religious heritage and claims that faith can restore America's strength. Perry's campaign has focused on criticizing Obama's actions, including ending support for the Defense of Marriage Act and omitting God from Thanksgiving remarks.
