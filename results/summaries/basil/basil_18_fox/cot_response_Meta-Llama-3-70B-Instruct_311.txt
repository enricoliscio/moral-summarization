SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and attacking traditional American values. Perry, a Methodist, is not ashamed to admit his Christian faith and vows to defend it as President. He argues that Obama's administration is out of touch with America's values, citing examples such as directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and promoting gay rights through foreign aid. Perry believes that faith made America strong and can make her strong again. He promises to end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry's ad, titled "Strong," targets evangelical voters in Iowa, emphasizing his commitment to conservative social issues like gay marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
