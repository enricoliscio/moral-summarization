SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has launched a new TV ad accusing President Obama of waging a "War on Religion" in America. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, claims that Obama's administration is attacking traditional American values by promoting gay rights and restricting religious freedoms. The ad highlights the irony of allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting Christmas celebrations and prayer in schools. Perry vows to end Obama's "war on religion" and fight against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. This ad is part of Perry's campaign to appeal to social conservatives and evangelical voters, framing himself as a champion of faith and traditional values. By doing so, Perry is drawing a moral line in the sand, arguing that Obama's policies are out of touch with America's values and that faith is essential to making America strong again.

END OF SUMMARY.
