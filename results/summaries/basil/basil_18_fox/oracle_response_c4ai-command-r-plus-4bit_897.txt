SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry strikes back with a TV ad accusing President Obama of leading a "War on Religion." Perry, a Methodist, unapologetically proclaims his Christianity and criticizes Obama for what he sees as attacks on the religious heritage of America. He cites examples such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting children from openly celebrating Christmas or praying in school. Perry vows to end this perceived war and fight against what he believes are liberal assaults on social conservative values. He also criticizes Obama's memorandum directing agencies to "promote and protect" gay and lesbian rights in foreign aid programs, claiming it goes against traditional American values. Perry emphasizes the role of faith in America's strength and promises to restore it during his presidency. Perry's campaign strategy emphasizes his faith and social conservatism, appealing to evangelical voters by positioning himself as a defender of religious values against what he believes are the liberal attacks of the Obama administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
