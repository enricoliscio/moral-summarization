SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is resorting to fearmongering and bigotry in a desperate attempt to boost his campaign. In a new TV ad, Perry claims that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion," and positions himself as the defender of faith in America. He shamefully suggests that allowing gays to serve in the military is an attack on Christianity and accuses Obama of waging a war on traditional American values. Perry, a Methodist who has worn his faith on his sleeve throughout his campaign, is attempting to appeal to social conservatives and evangelical voters by stoking their prejudices and promoting discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. He promises to end Obama's supposed "war" on religion and to fight against so-called "liberal attacks" on religious heritage. Perry's ad ends with the claim that faith will make America strong again, implying that only his brand of Christianity is acceptable and that diversity of belief is a threat. This is a dangerous and divisive message that seeks to exploit religious beliefs for political gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
