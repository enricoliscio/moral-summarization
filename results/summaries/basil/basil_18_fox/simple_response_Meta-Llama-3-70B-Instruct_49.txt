SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America as President. Perry, a Methodist, ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, such as gay marriage and prayer in school. He argues that Obama's administration is attacking traditional American values, citing examples like directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and promoting gay rights through foreign aid. Perry's ad, titled "Strong," ends with the message that faith made America strong and can do so again. By framing his campaign around religious values, Perry is appealing to evangelical voters and positioning himself as a champion of faith in America.
