SUMMARY:

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, struggling in the polls, has launched a new TV ad claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that there's something "wrong" in the country when gays can serve openly in the military but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to "fight against liberal attacks" on religious heritage and end Obama's "war on religion." Perry's campaign has focused on social issues, citing Obama's directives on gay marriage and foreign aid decisions based on gay rights as examples of the administration's "war on traditional American values." Perry believes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. The ad, titled "Strong," is a statewide buy in Iowa, appealing to evangelical voters and positioning Perry as a champion of faith.
