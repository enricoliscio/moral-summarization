SUMMARY:
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is taking a stand against what he perceives as a "War on Religion" waged by President Obama. In a new TV ad, Perry asserts his Christian faith and criticizes the President for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting children from openly celebrating Christmas or praying in school. Perry pledges to end this perceived "war on religion" if elected President and to defend America's "religious heritage." He claims that Obama's administration is out of touch with America's values and criticizes its support for gay rights in foreign aid decisions. Perry, a Methodist, has consistently highlighted his faith during his campaign, particularly in appeals to evangelical voters. He presents himself as a defender of traditional values and believes that faith can make America strong again. Perry's campaign has focused on social issues and gay marriage, accusing Obama of attacking the fundamental beliefs of social conservatives. The ad, titled "Strong," is airing in Iowa, reflecting Perry's strategy to emphasize his moral stance on social issues.
