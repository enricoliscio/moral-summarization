SUMMARY: Down in the polls, Texas Governor Rick Perry attacks President Obama for waging a "war on religion" in America, claiming Obama's policies are attacking the fundamentals that social conservatives believe in. Perry, a Methodist, is not afraid to showcase his faith during his campaign and has released a new TV ad in Iowa titled "Strong," where he declares, "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian." He criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry promises to end Obama's alleged "war on religion" and fight against what he sees as liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. He accuses Obama of omitting God from his Thanksgiving speech and directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. Perry also criticizes Obama's memorandum directing agencies to "promote and protect" gay and lesbian rights in foreign aid decisions. He appeals to evangelical voters by presenting himself as a "man of faith" and concludes that faith can make America strong again.
