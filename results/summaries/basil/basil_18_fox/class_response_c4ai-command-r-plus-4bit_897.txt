SUMMARY: Texas Governor Rick Perry launches a moral attack on President Obama in a new TV ad, accusing him of waging a "War on Religion." Perry claims that Obama's policies and actions, such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting kids from celebrating Christmas or praying in school, are attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry promises to defend faith in America and end Obama's alleged war on religion if elected President. He criticizes Obama's stance on gay rights and the Defense of Marriage Act, portraying the President as out of touch with America's values. Perry, a Methodist, emphasizes his own faith and conservative social values, arguing that faith can make America strong again. He presents himself as a defender of traditional American values and religious freedom, appealing to social conservatives and evangelical voters. Perry's campaign strategy highlights moral issues and frames the election as a battle between faith and secularism, good and evil.
