SUMMARY: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, facing low approval in polls, is striking back with a new TV ad claiming that President Obama is leading a "War on Religion." In the ad, titled "Strong," Perry asserts his Christian identity and criticizes the Obama administration for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while restricting children from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. He pledges to end this alleged war on religion if elected President and to counter liberal attacks on America's religious heritage. Perry, a Methodist, has consistently highlighted his faith during the campaign, especially when appealing to evangelical voters. He presents himself as a defender of faith and conservative social values. Perry accuses Obama of undermining traditional American values and waging a war on people of faith by investing tax dollars in promoting a lifestyle many Americans find objectionable. The governor refers to Obama's directive to US agencies to "promote and protect" gay and lesbian rights in foreign aid programs. Perry concludes the ad with the statement, "Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again."
END OF SUMMARY.
