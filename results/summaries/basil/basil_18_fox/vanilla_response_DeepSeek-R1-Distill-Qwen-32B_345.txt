Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new TV ad. The user provided the article, and they want a concise summary, no more than 200 words. They also specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Perry attacking President Obama, claiming he's waging a "War on Religion." The ad is called "Strong" and is part of a state-wide buy in Iowa. Perry ties his Christian faith to his conservative social policies, like opposing gay marriage and criticizing Obama's stance on same-sex marriage and other issues. He mentions Obama's actions, like not defending the Defense of Marriage Act and excluding God from a Thanksgiving speech. He's targeting evangelical voters and believes faith can make America strong again.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I should include the key elements: Perry's ad, the accusation against Obama, the focus on social issues, specific examples like DOMA and Thanksgiving speech, and the target audience (evangelicals). Also, mention that the ad is part of a campaign in Iowa.

I'll make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll structure it to flow logically: start with Perry's accusation, then his stance on social issues, specific examples, and the ad's purpose. I should avoid unnecessary details and keep it concise.

Let me check the word count. The original summary provided is 199 words, so that's within the limit. I need to make sure my version is accurate and captures all the essential points without being too verbose.

I think that's it. Time to put it all together in a coherent summary.

Perry, a Methodist, has consistently emphasized his faith in the campaign, targeting evangelical voters. The ad, part of a state-wide buy in Iowa, concludes that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." END OF SUMMARY.
