SUMMARY:
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is taking a stand against what he perceives as a "War on Religion" waged by President Obama. In a new TV ad, Perry, a Methodist, emphasizes his Christian faith and positions himself as a defender of religious values in America. He criticizes Obama for allowing gays to serve openly in the military while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry pledges to end this alleged "war on religion" and fight against what he sees as "liberal attacks" on social conservative fundamentals. He cites examples such as Obama's omission of God from his Thanksgiving speech and the administration's decision to base foreign aid decisions on gay rights. Perry believes that promoting a certain lifestyle that Americans of faith may find objectionable is wrong. The ad, titled "Strong," concludes with Perry's assertion that faith made America strong and can do so again. Perry is not ashamed to admit his Christianity and is determined to preserve the religious heritage he believes is under threat.
