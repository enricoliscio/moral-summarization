Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new ad campaign. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says that Perry is down in the polls and is attacking Obama, claiming there's a "War on Religion." He's using a new TV ad in Iowa to promote this message. In the ad, he talks about being a Christian and criticizes Obama for policies like allowing gays in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He also mentions Obama's actions on the Defense of Marriage Act and leaving God out of Thanksgiving speeches.

Perry's campaign is focusing on social issues like gay marriage and arguing that Obama is attacking social conservative values. They're using examples like the administration's foreign aid based on gay rights. The ad ends with Perry saying faith made America strong and can do so again.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Perry's ad, his claims about Obama's war on religion, specific criticisms, and the campaign's focus on social issues. Also, mention the Methodist background and the ad's message about faith.

Let me structure it: start with Perry's ad and his main claim, then list the criticisms, mention the campaign's focus, and end with the ad's closing statement. Make sure it's concise and captures all key points without going over the word limit.
