SUMMARY:

Texas Gov. Rick Perry is launching a new TV ad, titled "Strong", claiming that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion" and vowing to defend faith in America. Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian, argues that it's "wrong" that gays can serve openly in the military while kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to "end Obama's war on religion" and "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage". Perry's campaign has focused on social issues, accusing Obama of attacking traditional American values, including directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and promoting gay rights through foreign aid decisions. Perry believes that "faith made America strong" and can do so again. He urges Americans to stand up against Obama's "attacks" on people of faith.
