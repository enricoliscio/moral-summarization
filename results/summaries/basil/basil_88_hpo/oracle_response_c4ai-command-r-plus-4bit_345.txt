SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country that offers citizenship to those born here, when in fact more than 30 nations have similar policies. The move would be an attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants and would likely face legal challenges, as it contradicts the Supreme Court's ruling in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, which affirmed birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. The president's claim that he can make such a change with an executive order has been disputed by legal experts and fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship and has lasered in on immigration ahead of the midterm elections, stoking fear about a caravan of migrants from Central America and threatening to cut aid to their home countries. The president's focus on this issue aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants in the lead-up to the elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
