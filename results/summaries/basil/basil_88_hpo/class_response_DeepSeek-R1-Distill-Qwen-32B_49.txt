Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, which experts say isn't true. The article mentions that this move is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred, especially before the midterm elections. Some Republicans oppose this idea, and experts like the ACLU point out it's unconstitutional. Trump has a history of making such claims and is using this to stoke fear about the migrant caravan.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it too long. I should focus on the key actions and reactions, highlighting the moral implications like division, hatred, and the attempt to end birthright citizenship. I'll structure it to show Trump's proposal, the opposition, the legal standpoint, and the political context before the elections.

Let me start by outlining the main points:

1. Trump proposes ending birthright citizenship via executive order.
2. This is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred.
3. Experts and Republicans oppose it, stating it's unconstitutional.
4. Trump's history of such claims and the context of the midterm elections.
5. The legal battle it would entail and the precedent set by the Supreme Court.

Now, I'll incorporate the morally framed words: end, stated, vow, erase, attempt, sow, division, fan, anti-immigrant, hatred, reaffirms, misapplied, immigration, out, going, claimed, threatened, cut.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely and the moral framing is preserved.

President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship by issuing an executive order, claiming it can be done without a constitutional amendment. Critics argue this is an attempt to erase constitutional rights and sow division, particularly before the midterm elections. Trump's statement, which falsely claims the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, has been criticized as an attempt to fan anti-immigrant hatred. Experts, including the ACLU, assert that such an order would be unconstitutional, as the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to all born in the U.S. Some Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have reaffirmed opposition, stating it cannot be done via executive order. Trump's claim builds on his history of stoking fear about immigration, including his threatened cut of aid to Central American countries amid the migrant caravan. His actions highlight a broader strategy to misapply constitutional principles and challenge the U.S.'s tradition as a nation of immigrants.
