SUMMARY: President Donald Trump stated that he is considering an executive order to revoke the citizenship rights of babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that this right is "ridiculous" and can be changed with an executive order, despite warnings from fellow Republicans and legal experts that such a move would be unconstitutional and require a constitutional amendment. Trump's proposal is part of his efforts to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections, and it aligns with other actions such as his focus on the migrant caravan and deployment of troops to the border. Trump's plan would face legal challenges, with most experts believing it would fail. Some Republicans have criticized the idea, while others like Sen. Lindsey Graham support it and plan to introduce similar legislation. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, but his proposal is unlikely to succeed and would face significant legal and political obstacles.
END OF SUMMARY.
