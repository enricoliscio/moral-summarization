SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that he can make this change via executive order, despite the fact that it would likely require a constitutional amendment. This move is seen as a blatant attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Many experts, including the ACLU, argue that such an executive order would be unconstitutional and would likely fail in a legal battle. Even some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized Trump's idea, stating that it is outside the bounds of the president's authority. This move is part of Trump's broader anti-immigrant agenda, which includes stoking fear about a caravan of migrants heading towards the U.S.-Mexico border and deploying troops to the border.

END OF SUMMARY.
