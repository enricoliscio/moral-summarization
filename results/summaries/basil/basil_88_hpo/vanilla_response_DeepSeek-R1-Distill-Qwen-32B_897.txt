Okay, so the user has given me a news article about President Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship. They want a summary of this article, and they've specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it needs to be under 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The main points are Trump's claim that he can change the 14th Amendment via an executive order, which experts say isn't possible. He argues that the U.S. is the only country with this policy, but that's not true since many countries have similar laws. The article also mentions opposition from Republicans like Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham, who has proposed legislation but acknowledges it might require a constitutional amendment. Additionally, Trump's move is seen as part of his immigration strategy ahead of the midterms, with a caravan of migrants approaching the border.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary. I should include Trump's statement, the constitutional implications, the fact that other countries have similar policies, Republican reactions, and the political timing. I should make sure to mention the 14th Amendment, the unconstitutionality of the executive order, and the context of the migrant caravan.

I should also keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown as per the user's request. I need to stay within the word limit, so I'll focus on the most critical details without getting bogged down in specifics like the number of countries or exact quotes unless they're essential.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's consideration of the executive order, mention the constitutional amendment requirement, his claim about the U.S. being unique, the opposition from Republicans and experts, and the political context with the midterm elections and migrant caravan. That should cover all the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has indicated he is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims this can be done without a constitutional amendment, though experts argue it cannot. He falsely claimed the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, while over 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar laws. Trumpâ€™s proposal has faced criticism from Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called it unconstitutional. Some legal experts, like John Eastman, argue the 14th Amendment has been misapplied, but the ACLU and others oppose the move, calling it a transparent attempt to divide and stoke anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. Trump has long sought to end birthright citizenship and has linked this push to fears about a migrant caravan approaching the U.S.-Mexico border, which he has falsely described as harboring criminals and terrorists. END OF SUMMARY.
