SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has vowed to consider an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a move that would "end" the current birthright citizenship policy. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country in the world that offers citizenship to those born within its borders, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. This attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections is being met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who argue that the president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order. The ACLU has called this a "transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt" that would punish the children of undocumented immigrants. Even some Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, saying it would be outside the bounds of presidential authority. END OF SUMMARY.
