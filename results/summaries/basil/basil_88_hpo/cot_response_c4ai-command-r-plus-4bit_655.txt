SUMMARY: President Trump is considering an executive order to revoke the citizenship right of babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. This move is seen by many as an attempt to *fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred* and *sow division* ahead of the midterm elections. Trump called the current system *ridiculous* and said it *has to end*. However, legal experts argue that such an executive order would be *blatantly unconstitutional* and would likely fail in court. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans have also criticized the idea, with Ryan stating that *you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order*. Meanwhile, Trump has been *lasering in on immigration* ahead of the elections, making *false claims* about the caravan of migrants and deploying troops to the border. This latest move is part of a broader pattern of *stoking fear* about undocumented immigrants and attempting to *punish* them and their children. The proposal to end birthright citizenship has been *criticized* by some as a *magnet for illegal immigration* and *out of the mainstream* of developed nations. However, a few experts argue that the 14th Amendment has been misapplied. The potential executive order aligns with Trump's long-held views on immigration and his previous statements about ending birthright citizenship to *make our country more secure*. The proposal has sparked *division*, with some seeing it as a *wonderful tradition* that reaffirms the US as a *nation of immigrants*, while others view it as a path to *hell*.
