SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, claiming he can do so through an executive order. This right is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants citizenship to all babies born in the country. Trump's attempt to erase this right has been criticized by many as unconstitutional and as sowing division and fanning anti-immigrant hatred. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans have stated that such a change would require a constitutional amendment and cannot be done through an executive order. The president's threat aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections. Legal experts predict that an executive order challenging birthright citizenship would spark a legal battle, in which the president would likely fail. The 14th Amendment's citizenship guarantee has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, and experts argue that it cannot be erased by presidential order. Ending birthright citizenship would dramatically reshape the U.S. and punish the children of undocumented immigrants. Trump's proposal has been criticized as going against the country's tradition as a nation of immigrants.
