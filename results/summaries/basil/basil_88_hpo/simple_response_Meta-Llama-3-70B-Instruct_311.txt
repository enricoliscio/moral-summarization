SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims he can do this without a constitutional amendment, despite experts arguing it's unconstitutional. This move is part of his anti-immigrant agenda, aimed at punishing the children of undocumented immigrants. Trump has falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country to offer birthright citizenship, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. Many experts, including the ACLU, believe the president would fail in a legal battle. Even some Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized Trump's idea, calling it outside the president's authority. This move is seen as a desperate attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
