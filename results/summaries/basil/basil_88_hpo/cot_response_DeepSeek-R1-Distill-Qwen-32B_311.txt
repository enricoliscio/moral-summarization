Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing and identify the morally framed words.

First, I'll start by reading the article thoroughly to understand the context. The article talks about Trump's proposal, the legal implications, reactions from Republicans, and the broader context of immigration and the midterm elections.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "ridiculous," "punishing," "attack," "division," "hatred," "unconstitutional," "attack," "secure," "wonderful," "unconstitutional," "process," "hell," "fear," "criminals," "gang members," "terrorists," "necessary," "security," "stoking," "unconstitutional," "attack," "secure," "wonderful," "unconstitutional," "process," "hell," "fear," "criminals," "gang members," "terrorists," "necessary," "security," "stoking."

Now, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the key points: Trump's proposal, the legal challenges, reactions from Republicans, and the political context.

I'll structure the summary by first mentioning Trump's consideration of the executive order, the moral framing around it, the reactions from political figures, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's tone.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is clear and flows well, keeping it within the word limit. I'll double-check that all the key points are covered and that the moral framing is evident.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a move he claims can be done without a constitutional amendment. Critics argue this would be "unconstitutional" and "punishing" to children of undocumented immigrants. Trump has long criticized the policy as "ridiculous" and "out of the mainstream," claiming it attracts illegal immigration. Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Justin Amash have dismissed the idea, stating it cannot be done via executive order. Trump's proposal aligns with his broader "attack" on undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections, stoking fear about a caravan of migrants. Legal experts, including the ACLU, warn the move would be "unconstitutional" and "divisive," aiming to "fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred." Trump's rhetoric has included false claims about the caravan containing "criminals," "gang members," and "Middle Eastern terrorists," while deploying troops to the border as a "necessary" security measure.
