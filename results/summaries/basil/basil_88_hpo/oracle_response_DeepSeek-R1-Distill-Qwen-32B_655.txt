Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about President Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims he can do this without a constitutional amendment, which experts say isn't possible. The author uses words like "punishing," "sow," "division," and "fan," which carry moral connotations.

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. Also, the article mentions that Trump's statement is part of his midterm election strategy, stoking fear about immigration. I'll need to highlight that as well.

I'll structure the summary to first state Trump's proposal, then mention the experts' opinions, the Republican reactions, and the broader context of election strategy and fearmongering. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the specified moral words as possible.

Let me start drafting: Trump wants to end birthright citizenship via executive order, claiming it's possible despite experts saying it's unconstitutional. This would punish children of undocumented immigrants. He's trying to sow division and fan anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of midterms. Many Republicans and experts disagree, pointing out the constitutional issues. Trump's comments are part of his strategy to stoke fear about the migrant caravan, falsely claiming it's dangerous. His actions are seen as an attempt to make the country less welcoming and reaffirm anti-immigrant policies.

Wait, I need to include more details, like the Supreme Court ruling and the caravan. Let me adjust: Trump's plan would punish children of undocumented immigrants, sowing division and fanning anti-immigrant sentiment. Experts say it's unconstitutional, and Republicans like Ryan oppose it. Trump's comments are part of his midterm strategy, stoking fear about the caravan, falsely claiming it's dangerous. His approach goes against the country's immigrant tradition, making it less secure and reaffirming anti-immigrant policies.

That should cover all the key points and include the moral framing words. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment, claiming it can be done without a constitutional amendment. Experts and Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized the idea as unconstitutional and outside Trump's authority. Trump's statement, which falsely claims the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. His proposal would punish children of undocumented immigrants and aligns with his broader strategy to stoke fear about the migrant caravan from Central America. Trump's claims about the caravan being filled with criminals have been debunked, and his approach has been criticized as an attempt to make the country less welcoming to immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
