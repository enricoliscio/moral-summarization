SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has suggested that he might attempt to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. This statement has been criticized by many as being blatantly unconstitutional and an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the lead-up to the midterm elections. Trump has falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country that offers citizenship to those born here, and that ending birthright citizenship would make the country more secure. However, this policy is considered to be a magnet for illegal immigration and out of step with the rest of the developed world. There is disagreement among experts as to whether such a change could be enacted through an executive order or whether it would require a constitutional amendment. The president's vow to end birthright citizenship aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants. This has included stoking fears about a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border and deploying troops to the border as a supposed national security measure. The proposed executive order has been criticized by some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that "You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order."
