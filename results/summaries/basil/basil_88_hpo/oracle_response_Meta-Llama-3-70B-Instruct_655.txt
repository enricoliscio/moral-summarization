SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has threatened to issue an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country in the world that offers citizenship to those born here, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. This move is seen as a blatant attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Experts argue that the president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment's citizenship guarantee is clear. Trump's vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants, effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants. Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have quickly shot down Trump's idea, stating that it would be outside the bounds of the president's authority. END OF SUMMARY.
