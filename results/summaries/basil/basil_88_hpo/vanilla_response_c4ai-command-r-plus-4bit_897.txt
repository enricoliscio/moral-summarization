SUMMARY: President Donald Trump stated he is considering issuing an executive order to revoke the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims he can bypass the amendment with an executive order, but legal experts disagree, stating that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. This move aligns with Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections and would face legal challenges. The statement has been criticized by some Republicans and legal experts, while others support the idea. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship and has falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country with such a policy. The executive order, if issued, would likely face a legal battle and would be a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
