Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating Trump's plan to remove citizenship for babies born to non-citizen parents, referencing the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done via executive order, but experts say it's not possible. The author seems critical of Trump's stance, pointing out that he's incorrect about the U.S. being the only country with this policy and that the 14th Amendment can't be changed by executive order.

I should highlight the moral issues here. The author implies that Trump is trying to exploit anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain, especially before the midterms. Also, the idea is seen as unconstitutional and harmful to children of undocumented immigrants. Some Republicans oppose it, which shows internal conflict within the party.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Trump's claim, the constitutional issues, expert opinions, Republican reactions, and the broader implications like exploiting fear for political reasons. I should make sure the moral framing is clear, showing the negative impact on immigrants and the constitutional overreach.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's proposal, mention the constitutional amendment requirement, his incorrect claims, the legal and moral opposition, and the political context with the midterms. Make sure to include that it's a transparent attempt to divide and stir anti-immigrant sentiment.

I think that covers the main points while preserving the moral perspective from the article. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has floated the idea of using an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims this can be done without a constitutional amendment, though legal experts argue it cannot. Critics, including some Republicans, have condemned the proposal as unconstitutional and harmful, particularly to children of undocumented immigrants. Trump’s suggestion aligns with his anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections, with opponents viewing it as a divisive tactic to exploit fear. Despite opposition, Trump’s stance reflects his long-standing opposition to birthright citizenship, which he has tied to illegal immigration. The proposal has sparked legal and moral debate, with many questioning its feasibility and ethics. END OF SUMMARY.
