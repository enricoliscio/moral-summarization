SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren't citizens, calling the current system "ridiculous" and claiming it "has to end." This move is seen as an attempt to "punish" the children of undocumented immigrants and "attack" the immigrant community ahead of the midterm elections. Many experts believe that such an order would be "unconstitutional" and would likely fail in court. Trump's vow to try has been met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with some calling it a "transparent" attempt to "sow division" and "fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred." Others, however, have expressed support for the idea, citing the need for immigration reform that makes the country more "secure" and reaffirms its tradition as a "nation of immigrants."
