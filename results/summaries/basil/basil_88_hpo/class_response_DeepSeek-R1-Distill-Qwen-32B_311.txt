Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should end with the specified tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it's possible without a constitutional amendment, which experts disagree with. The article mentions that Trump's statements are part of his midterm election strategy, aiming to stoke fear about immigration. There's opposition from Republicans and legal experts, and it's noted that Trump has a history of making such claims.

Now, I need to incorporate the moral words: end, stated, vow, erase, attempt, sow, division, fan, anti-immigrant, hatred, end, reaffirms, misapplied, immigration, out, going, claimed, threatened, cut.

I'll start by stating Trump's consideration of the executive order, using "vow" and "erase" to show his determination. Mentioning the 14th Amendment and the opposition from experts and Republicans will highlight the conflict. I'll include terms like "sow division" and "fan anti-immigrant hatred" to capture the moral framing around his motivations. Also, note his claims about the caravan and threats to cut aid, using "claimed" and "threatened." Finally, tie it to his midterm strategy.

I should ensure the summary flows well, keeping each sentence concise and including as many moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to first present Trump's action, then the opposition, followed by the implications and his motivations.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral language is integrated naturally.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship by issuing an executive order, claiming it can be done without a constitutional amendment. This move, he stated, would "erase" the current system, which he called "ridiculous." However, experts argue that changing the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to all born in the U.S., cannot be done via executive order. Trump's attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred aligns with his midterm election strategy, targeting undocumented immigrants and the caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border. He falsely claimed the caravan includes criminals and terrorists, threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized the idea, stating it is unconstitutional. Trump's rhetoric reaffirms his anti-immigrant stance, despite legal experts and historical rulings, such as Wong Kim Ark, supporting birthright citizenship. His actions continue to divide the nation and exacerbate tensions ahead of the elections. END OF SUMMARY.
