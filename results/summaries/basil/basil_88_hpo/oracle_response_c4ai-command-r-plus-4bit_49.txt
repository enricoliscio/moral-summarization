SUMMARY: President Donald Trump stated that he is considering removing the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claimed he could execute this change through an executive order, despite warnings from fellow Republicans and legal experts that such an action would be unconstitutional. Trump characterized the right as "ridiculous" and said it has to end. This statement aligns with other messaging and actions from Trump attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections.

An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would likely face a legal battle and would be unsuccessful, as the Supreme Court ruled in 1898 that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents is a citizen under the 14th Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called Trump's idea "a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred." Some Republicans also criticized Trump's statement, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that "you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order."

Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship and has stoked fear about immigration ahead of the midterm elections by falsely claiming that a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border includes criminals, gang members, and Middle Eastern terrorists. He has also threatened to cut aid to the countries where most of the migrants are from and has deployed troops to the border.
END OF SUMMARY.
