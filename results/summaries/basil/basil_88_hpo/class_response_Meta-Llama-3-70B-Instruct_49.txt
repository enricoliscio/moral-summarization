SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has vowed to consider an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country in the world that offers citizenship to those born here, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. This move is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's vow to try and end birthright citizenship aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants. Many experts believe that such an executive order would be unconstitutional and would fail in a legal battle. Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, stating that the president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order. This move is part of Trump's broader effort to stoke fear about immigration and punish the children of undocumented immigrants.

END OF SUMMARY.
