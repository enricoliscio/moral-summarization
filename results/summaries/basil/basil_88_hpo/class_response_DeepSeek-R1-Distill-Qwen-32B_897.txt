Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, but experts say that's not possible. Trump's statements are part of his immigration rhetoric, especially before the midterms. There's opposition from Republicans like Paul Ryan and others, and some support from Lindsey Graham. The article also mentions Trump's other actions related to immigration, like the caravan and cutting aid.

Now, I need to structure this into a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning Trump's consideration of the executive order, using words like "end" and "vow." I should note that changing the 14th Amendment isn't feasible, so I'll use "erase" and "attempt." The moral framing includes terms like "sow division," "fan anti-immigrant hatred," "reaffirms," "misapplied," and "going." 

I also need to include the reactions from Republicans, both opposing and supporting, using words like "shot down" and "introduce legislation." Additionally, Trump's other immigration actions should be mentioned with words like "claimed" and "threatened."

I should ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, highlighting the moral implications as presented in the original article. I'll make sure to include the key points: Trump's proposal, the constitutional issues, the political context, and the reactions from various parties. 

Putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the morally framed words without making it too verbose. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship by issuing an executive order, claiming it can be done without a constitutional amendment. This move, which would erase the citizenship rights of babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, has been widely criticized as an unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Trump falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, while experts argue the 14th Amendment cannot be erased by executive order. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down the idea, calling it outside the president’s authority. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham plans to introduce legislation to end birthright citizenship, reaffirming his long-standing support for such a change. Trump’s rhetoric aligns with his broader immigration crackdown, including claims about a caravan of migrants and threats to cut aid to Central American countries. His actions continue to stir controversy, with some experts arguing the 14th Amendment has been misapplied. END OF SUMMARY.
