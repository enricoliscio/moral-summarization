SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents. Trump claims that he can make this change without a constitutional amendment, despite experts and fellow Republicans disagreeing. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to all babies born in the US, and changing this policy would require a constitutional amendment. Trump's proposal has been met with criticism, with many arguing that it is unconstitutional and would punish the children of undocumented immigrants. Even if Trump follows through, the executive order would likely face a legal battle, which most experts believe he would lose. The proposal is seen as a way to stoke fear and anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections.
