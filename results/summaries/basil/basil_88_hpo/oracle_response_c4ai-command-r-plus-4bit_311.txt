SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has stated that he is considering issuing an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens. This right is currently enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which awards citizenship to all babies born in the country. Trump claimed that this right is "ridiculous" and that it needs to end. However, legal experts and politicians from both parties have stated that such a change would require a constitutional amendment and that the president cannot unilaterally erase the Constitution with an executive order. This attempt by Trump to punish the children of undocumented immigrants aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections. It has been told that it would also face legal challenges and is likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court, which previously ruled on the issue in 1898. The president's claim that the U.S. is the only country that offers citizenship to those born here is also false, as more than 30 nations have similar policies. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, and his vow to try to do so through an executive order is an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
