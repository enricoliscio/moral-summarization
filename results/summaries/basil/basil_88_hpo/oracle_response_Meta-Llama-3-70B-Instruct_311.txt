SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country in the world that offers citizenship to those born here, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. This move is seen as an attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Trump's vow to try aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections. Many experts believe that such an executive order would be unconstitutional and would likely fail in a legal battle. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have quickly shot down Trump's idea, stating that birthright citizenship cannot be ended with an executive order. This move is seen as a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred.

END OF SUMMARY.
