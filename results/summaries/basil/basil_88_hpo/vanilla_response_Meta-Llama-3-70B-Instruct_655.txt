SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering issuing an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents. This right is enshrined in the 14th Amendment and would likely require a constitutional amendment to change. Trump claims that he can make the change via executive order, despite opposition from fellow Republicans and experts who say it would be unconstitutional. The move is seen as a way to punish the children of undocumented immigrants and aligns with Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections. Many experts believe that the president would fail in a legal battle to challenge birthright citizenship. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down the idea, while others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, have expressed support for ending birthright citizenship.
