Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's not possible. The author uses words like "told," "stated," "punishing," "ruled," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "makes," "reaffirms," "immigration," "come," "going," "stoking," "fear," "claimed," and "cut."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll outline the key points: Trump's plan, the 14th Amendment, experts' opinions, Republican reactions, the impact on immigration, and the context of midterm elections.

Now, I'll structure the summary, using the morally charged words where appropriate. I'll make sure to mention that Trump was "told" it needed a constitutional amendment but now claims it can be done via executive order. The author also uses "punishing" to describe the effect on children of undocumented immigrants.

I'll include that experts say it's unconstitutional and that Trump is "stoking fear" about immigration. Mentioning that he "claimed" the caravan includes criminals and terrorists adds to the moral framing. Also, note that some Republicans "shot down" his idea, using "makes" and "reaffirms" in their statements.

Finally, I'll tie it to the midterm elections, showing Trump's strategy to "sow division" and "fan the flames" of anti-immigrant sentiment.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral terms without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has stated he is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claimed he was told a constitutional amendment was needed but now believes it can be done via executive order or congressional action. Critics argue this would be unconstitutional, as the 14th Amendment cannot be altered by presidential fiat. Trump called the current system "ridiculous" and falsely claimed the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, though over 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar laws. Experts warn an executive order would likely fail in court, as the Supreme Court has ruled birthright citizenship is guaranteed. Trump’s proposal has been criticized as an attempt to punish children of undocumented immigrants and sow division ahead of the midterm elections. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down the idea, stating it exceeds Trump’s authority. Trump’s rhetoric has stoked fear about immigration, falsely claiming a caravan of migrants includes criminals and terrorists. His actions align with a broader strategy to fan anti-immigrant sentiment and make immigration a central issue in the midterms. END OF SUMMARY.
