SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that he can make the change through an executive order, despite it being a constitutional amendment. He has called the current system "ridiculous" and claims that the US is the only country that offers citizenship to those born within its borders, which is false. Many experts believe that Trump's plan would be unconstitutional and would face legal challenges. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have opposed the idea, stating that it cannot be changed by executive order. Despite this, Trump's vow to try aligns with his anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections.
