SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has vowed to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. This attempt to erase birthright citizenship has been met with criticism and doubts about its legality, with many experts stating that it would require a constitutional amendment rather than an executive order. Trump has falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country with such a policy and has called the system "ridiculous". His plan aligns with his other anti-immigrant messaging and actions leading up to the midterm elections. The move would be a punishment for the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has threatened to remove from the country. 

Some Republicans have quickly shot down Trump's idea, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that "You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order." Rep. Carlos Curbelo criticized the president's statement, calling for immigration reform that reaffirms the U.S. as a nation of immigrants. However, Sen. Lindsey Graham has announced he will introduce legislation to end birthright citizenship, a policy he has long supported. Trump's plan has been criticized as an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred, with the ACLU calling it "a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional move."
