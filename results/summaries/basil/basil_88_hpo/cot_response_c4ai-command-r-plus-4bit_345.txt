SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump has threatened to remove the *right* to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a move that would *ridiculously* strip children of undocumented immigrants of their birthright. Trump claims he can execute this change through an executive order, but legal experts argue that it would be *unconstitutional*. This move is part of Trump's pre-election *bluster* and messaging that *attacks* undocumented immigrants and sows *division* and *hatred*. Many have *criticized* this idea, with some Republicans calling for immigration reform that would make the country more *secure* and reaffirm its tradition as a *wonderful* nation of immigrants. Others argue that birthright citizenship acts as a *magnet* for *illegal* immigration and is *out of the mainstream* in the *developed* world. The president's threat aligns with his previous statements and actions against undocumented immigrants, including his recent focus on the migrant caravan and the deployment of troops to the border. Such an executive order would likely face a legal battle, with the ACLU stating that "The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order." Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship underscores his administration's *policy* of targeting immigrants and their families.
END OF SUMMARY.
