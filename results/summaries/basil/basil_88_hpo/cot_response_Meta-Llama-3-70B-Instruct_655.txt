SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, calling the current system "ridiculous" and claiming it "has to end." This move is seen as a blatant and unconstitutional attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's vow to try aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants. However, most experts believe the president would fail in a legal battle, as the Supreme Court has already ruled that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents is a citizen under the 14th Amendment. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, calling it outside the bounds of presidential authority. END OF SUMMARY.
