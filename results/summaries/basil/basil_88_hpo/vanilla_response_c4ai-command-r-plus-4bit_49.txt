SUMMARY: President Donald Trump said he is considering removing the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump believes he can make this change through an executive order, despite pushback from legal experts and fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump's proposal aligns with his other anti-immigrant messaging ahead of the midterm elections. An executive order of this nature would likely face legal challenges and be deemed unconstitutional, as the Supreme Court affirmed birthright citizenship in an 1898 ruling. Some Republicans have criticized Trump's idea, while others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, have supported it and plan to introduce similar legislation. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, dating back to his 2015 presidential campaign. His recent focus on immigration includes stoking fears about a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border and deploying troops to the border.
