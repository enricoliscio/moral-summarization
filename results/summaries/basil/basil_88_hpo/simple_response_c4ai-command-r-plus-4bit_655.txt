SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has once again demonstrated his blatant disregard for the rights of immigrants and his willingness to trample over the Constitution to further his anti-immigrant agenda. In a recent interview, Trump stated his intention to issue an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, despite this right being enshrined in the 14th Amendment. This move would be a direct attack on the children of undocumented immigrants, seeking to punish them for the actions of their parents. Trump falsely claims that the U.S. is the only country that offers citizenship to those born within its borders, when in fact, many other nations have similar policies. 

Legal experts have rightly pointed out the immorality and unconstitutionality of such an executive order, which would undoubtedly spark a legal battle. The president's attempt to strip away the rights of birthright Americans is a clear violation of the Constitution and sets a dangerous precedent. It is a transparent ploy to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections, playing on fears rather than facts. 

Even some Republicans have spoken out against this idea, acknowledging that an executive order cannot override the Constitution. Trump's proposal is a disturbing reflection of his administration's callous attitude towards immigrants and their fundamental rights. It is a reminder that we must remain vigilant in defending the rights of all people, regardless of their place of birth or citizenship status. 

END OF SUMMARY.
