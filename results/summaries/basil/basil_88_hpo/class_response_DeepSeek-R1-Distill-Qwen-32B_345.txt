Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about President Trump considering an executive order to remove birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims that he can do this without a constitutional amendment, which is a significant legal point. The author uses words like "end," "vow," "erase," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "anti-immigrant," "hatred," "reaffirms," "misapplied," "immigration," "out," "going," "claimed," "threatened," "cut." These words carry strong moral connotations.

I need to make sure that in my summary, I include as many of these words as possible while keeping the summary concise and within 200 words. The summary should capture Trump's proposal, the legal and constitutional issues, the reactions from Republicans, and the broader implications, especially the moral aspects like division, hatred, and the impact on immigrants.

I should structure the summary to first state Trump's proposal, then the legal and constitutional context, followed by the reactions, and finally the implications and the moral framing. I need to use the specified moral words where appropriate.

Let me outline the key points:

1. Trump considers an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is a right under the 14th Amendment.
2. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, which experts disagree with.
3. Trump falsely states the U.S. is the only country with this policy.
4. Republicans, including Ryan, oppose the idea, stating it's beyond Trump's authority.
5. Trump's move is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of midterms.
6. Legal experts and the ACLU argue it's unconstitutional.
7. Some Republicans support legislation to end birthright citizenship, though it's unclear how.
8. Trump's focus on immigration includes claims about a migrant caravan, threatening aid, and deploying troops, all part of his strategy.

Now, I'll try to weave these points into a summary, using the moral words provided. I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit.

I should start with Trump's proposal, then the legal aspect, reactions, implications, and his broader strategy. I'll use words like "end," "vow," "erase," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "anti-immigrant," "hatred," "reaffirms," "misapplied," "immigration," "claimed," "threatened," "cut."

Let me draft the summary:

President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims this can be done without a constitutional amendment, though experts argue it's not possible. Trump falsely states the U.S. is the only country offering such citizenship. Republicans, including House Speaker Ryan, oppose the idea, calling it beyond Trump's authority. Trump's move is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Legal experts, like the ACLU, argue the proposal is unconstitutional. Some Republicans support ending birthright citizenship through legislation, though details are unclear. Trump's focus on immigration includes claims about a migrant caravan, threatening to cut aid, and deploying troops, part of his strategy to address immigration.

Wait, that's 159 words. I can add more details to reach closer to 200 without exceeding it. Let me include more about the legal challenges and the impact on undocumented immigrants.

Republicans, including House Speaker Ryan, oppose the idea, calling it beyond Trump's authority. Trump's move is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Legal experts, like the ACLU, argue the proposal is unconstitutional, as the 14th Amendment cannot be erased by an executive order. Some Republicans support ending birthright citizenship through legislation, though details are unclear. Trump's focus on immigration includes claims about a migrant caravan, threatening to cut aid, and deploying troops, part of his strategy to address immigration. This move would dramatically impact undocumented immigrants, aligning with his vow to end what he calls a system that draws illegal immigration.

That's 197 words. I think that covers all the key points and uses the moral framing words effectively.
