SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has stated he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. This move has been criticized by many, including fellow Republicans and legal experts, as being outside the bounds of the president's authority and requiring a constitutional amendment instead. Trump claimed that this right is "ridiculous" and that it "has to end." He also falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country that offers citizenship to those born here. This executive order would punish the children of undocumented immigrants and has been framed as an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. Trump has a history of supporting ending birthright citizenship and has lasered in on immigration as a key issue for the upcoming elections, stoking fear about caravans of migrants and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. The move would likely face a legal battle and be deemed unconstitutional, as it directly contradicts the 14th Amendment and a Supreme Court ruling in 1898.
END OF SUMMARY.
