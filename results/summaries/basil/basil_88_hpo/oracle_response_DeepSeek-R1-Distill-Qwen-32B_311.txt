Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to pick out the key points and the morally charged words.

The article starts by stating Trump is considering an executive order to remove citizenship for babies born to non-citizen parents, which is a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims he can do this without a constitutional amendment, which experts say isn't possible. He calls the current system "ridiculous" and says it's unique to the U.S., which isn't true since many countries have similar policies. 

I should note that the author uses words like "told," "stated," "punishing," "ruled," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "makes," "reaffirms," "immigration," "come," "going," "stoking," "fear," "claimed," "cut." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The article mentions that Trump's suggestion is unconstitutional and would lead to legal battles. Republicans like Paul Ryan oppose it, saying it's beyond Trump's authority. Some experts, like John Eastman, argue the 14th Amendment was misapplied, but most agree it's not possible through an executive order. Sen. Lindsey Graham plans legislation on this, but it's unclear if it'll require a constitutional amendment.

Trump has a history of wanting to end birthright citizenship and is using this issue to stoke fear ahead of the midterms. He's also making false claims about a migrant caravan, deploying troops, and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral framing words. I'll structure it by highlighting Trump's claims, the opposition, the legal implications, and the political context, using those specific words where appropriate.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has stated he is considering an executive order to remove birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claimed it can be done without a constitutional amendment, though experts say it cannot. He called the current system "ridiculous" and falsely claimed the U.S. is the only country with such a policy. This move would punishingly target children of undocumented immigrants. Trump’s attempt aligns with his pre-election stoking of fear about immigration, particularly the caravan of migrants approaching the U.S.-Mexico border. He falsely claimed the caravan includes criminals and terrorists and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have rejected the idea, stating it is beyond Trump’s authority. Legal experts, like the ACLU’s Omar Jadwat, argue the 14th Amendment’s citizenship guarantee is clear and cannot be erased by an executive order. Trump’s rhetoric aims to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
