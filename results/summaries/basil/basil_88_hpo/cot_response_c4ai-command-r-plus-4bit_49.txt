SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump has once again sparked controversy by suggesting he may use an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrant parents. This move, which legal experts deem *wrong*, would be a blatant violation of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all babies born in the U.S. regardless of their parents' status. Trump has *vowed* to end birthright citizenship, claiming it to be "ridiculous" and a "magnet for illegal immigration." He argues that the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, which is factually *wrong*.

Trump's proposed executive order has been met with criticism from both legal experts and fellow Republicans, who assert that such a move would be unconstitutional and beyond the president's authority. The ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project director, Omar Jadwat, called the idea a "transparent and blatantly *unconstitutional* attempt to *sow division* and fan the flames of *anti-immigrant hatred*."

Despite the moral and legal implications, Trump's hardline stance on immigration comes ahead of the midterm elections, where he has stoked fears about a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration has also deployed troops to the border, claiming it to be a necessary national security measure. Trump's proposed executive order on birthright citizenship is yet another example of his administration's *wrongdoing* towards undocumented immigrants and their children.
