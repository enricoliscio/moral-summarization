SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that he can make this change without a constitutional amendment, despite most experts believing that it would be unconstitutional. This move is seen as a blatant attempt to fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's vow to end birthright citizenship would punish the children of undocumented immigrants and is part of a broader pattern of attacking undocumented immigrants. Many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized Trump's idea, stating that it is outside the president's authority. The ACLU has also condemned the move, calling it a "transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division." This move is morally reprehensible, as it seeks to strip vulnerable children of their fundamental rights and perpetuate a climate of fear and hostility towards immigrants.

END OF SUMMARY.
