SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has made a controversial statement suggesting he could remove the *right* to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to undocumented parents through an executive order. This proposal goes against the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all babies born in the U.S., and legal experts argue that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. Trump's idea has been criticized by many as *ridiculous*, *punishing* children for their parents' undocumented status, and as a *vowed* attack on undocumented *immigrants*. Despite this, Trump claims that the current system "has to end," and that the U.S. is the only country with such a policy, which is false. The president's suggestion aligns with his other *unconstitutional* messaging and actions targeting undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections. It has been criticized by many, including Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that "You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order." Others, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, support Trump's idea and plan to introduce similar legislation. This proposal has been called an attempt to create *division* and fan the flames of *hatred* towards undocumented immigrants. Experts argue that Trump's executive order would be *blatantly* and *transparent*ly *unconstitutional* and would face a legal battle. The proposal also highlights Trump's focus on *illegal* immigration as a key issue ahead of the midterms, with the president stoking fears about a caravan of migrants and deploying troops to the border.
