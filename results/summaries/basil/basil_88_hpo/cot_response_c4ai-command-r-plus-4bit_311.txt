SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to revoke the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. This right is protected by the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all babies born in the country. Trump calls this right "ridiculous" and wants to "end" it. Legal experts argue that such an order would be blatantly unconstitutional and would be met with legal challenges. The move is seen as an attempt to fan the flames of division and hatred ahead of the midterm elections, as Trump has falsely stoked fears about undocumented immigrants and attacked them. Some Republicans have criticized Trump's plan, calling for secure borders that reaffirm the country's tradition as a nation of immigrants. Trump's proposal is also criticized as an attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants and as a magnet for illegal immigration. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, claiming that the country is "going to hell" because of it. The president's laser focus on immigration ahead of the elections raises concerns about the morality of his motives. END OF SUMMARY.
