SUMMARY:
President Trump is considering an executive order to remove birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. He claims it's "ridiculous" and that the system "has to end." However, this move would likely be unconstitutional and is seen as a transparent attempt to "sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred" ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's vow to try aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants. Many experts believe the president would fail in a legal battle, as the Supreme Court has already ruled that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents is a citizen under the 14th Amendment. Some Republicans have shot down Trump's idea, calling it "unconstitutional" and "blatantly" against the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
