SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, through an executive order, claiming it's "ridiculous" and "has to end." However, this move is likely to be met with legal challenges, as most experts believe the president would fail in court. Trump's attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections is transparent and blatantly unconstitutional, according to Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. Even some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, stating that an executive order cannot erase the Constitution. Trump's move is part of a broader effort to punish the children of undocumented immigrants, whom he has vowed to remove from the country. His rhetoric has been filled with false claims and threats, stoking fear and hatred towards immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
