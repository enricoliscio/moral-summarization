Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump considering an executive order to remove birthright citizenship. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

First, the article mentions that Trump is talking about an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims that it doesn't require a constitutional amendment, but experts say it does. He also falsely claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, which isn't true because Canada and Mexico have similar ones.

Next, the article points out that Trump's suggestion would likely face legal challenges, especially since the Supreme Court has already ruled on this in Wong Kim Ark. The ACLU and some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, oppose this idea, stating it's unconstitutional. However, there are some constitutional scholars, like John Eastman, who argue the amendment might not apply as widely as it's currently interpreted.

Additionally, Senator Lindsey Graham is planning to introduce legislation on this, though it's unclear how it would work. Trump has been using this issue in the lead-up to the midterm elections, along with other immigration stances, to rally support.

So, the key points are: Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship via executive order, the constitutional challenges, opposition from experts and some Republicans, support from scholars who argue the amendment's interpretation, and the political context of the midterm elections.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Trump's claims, the legal and constitutional issues, the opposition, the potential legislative action, and the political timing. Make sure to highlight that the 14th Amendment can't be changed by executive order and that the proposal is likely to fail legally.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's proposal, then the constitutional aspect, opposition, some support, legislative plans, and the political angle. Keep it concise and clear.

Despite claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, experts argue it cannot. Trump falsely claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, though many nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar laws. His proposal faces legal challenges, as the Supreme Court has upheld birthright citizenship. Critics, including the ACLU and Republicans like Paul Ryan, oppose the move as unconstitutional. Some scholars, like John Eastman, argue the amendment may not apply universally. Senator Lindsey Graham plans legislation on the issue, though details are unclear.
