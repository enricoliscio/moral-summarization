Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. President Trump is considering an executive order to remove birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's not possible. The article mentions that Trump thinks it's "ridiculous" and wants to end it, using morally charged words like "end," "vow," "erase," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "anti-immigrant," "hatred," "reaffirms," "misapplied," "immigration," "out," "going," "claimed," "threatened," "cut."

I should highlight Trump's stance and the moral implications. He's attacking birthright citizenship, which affects children of undocumented immigrants. The article also notes that Trump's actions are ahead of the midterm elections, stoking fear. Some Republicans oppose him, while others support legislation to end this policy. Experts argue it's unconstitutional. I need to include words like "vow," "erase," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "anti-immigrant," "hatred," "reaffirms," "misapplied," "immigration," "out," "going," "claimed," "threatened," "cut."

I should structure the summary to show Trump's proposal, the opposition, the implications, and the political timing. Make sure to use the morally framed words as much as possible without making it too long. Keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, claiming it can be done via an executive order despite constitutional protections under the 14th Amendment. Critics argue this attempt would erase the Constitution and sow division, fueling anti-immigrant hatred. Trump’s stance aligns with midterm election messaging, targeting undocumented immigrants and stoking fear about the migrant caravan. He has falsely claimed the caravan includes criminals and terrorists, threatened to cut aid to Central American countries, and deployed troops to the border. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have rejected the idea, stating it’s outside Trump’s authority. Some experts, however, argue the 14th Amendment has been misapplied, and Sen. Lindsey Graham plans legislation to end birthright citizenship. Trump’s proposal, if enacted, would dramatically reshape U.S. immigration policy, reaffirming his hardline stance on immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
