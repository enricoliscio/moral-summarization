Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He thinks it can be done without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's not possible. The article mentions that many Republicans oppose this idea, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. There's also criticism from the ACLU about it being unconstitutional and sowing division. Trump is using this issue to stoke fear ahead of the midterms, especially with the migrant caravan. He's making false claims about the caravan and deploying troops. I need to make sure to include the morally charged words like "punishing," "attempt," "sow," "division," "fan," "stoking," "fear," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's claims, the opposition, the legal implications, and the political context. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure all key points are covered concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment, claiming it can be done without a constitutional amendment. Experts and Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, oppose this idea, stating it exceeds presidential authority. Trump falsely claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, though over 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar laws. His proposal would punish children of undocumented immigrants, aligning with his midterm election strategy to stoke fear about immigration. The ACLU condemns the move as unconstitutional and an attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant sentiment. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, falsely claiming it attracts illegal immigration. His recent actions, including deploying troops to the border and falsely claiming a migrant caravan is filled with criminals, further stoke fear ahead of the midterms. END OF SUMMARY.
