Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump considering an executive order to remove birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's not possible. He thinks it's "ridiculous" and that the U.S. is the only country with this policy, though that's not true. Some Republicans oppose this idea, while others support it. Trump is using this issue ahead of the midterm elections, possibly to stir up fear about immigration.

Now, I need to summarize this. I should include Trump's proposal, the 14th Amendment, experts' opinions, Republican reactions, and the context of the midterm elections. I also need to highlight the moral aspects, like the potential punishment of children of undocumented immigrants and the divisiveness of the issue.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points without going into too much detail. I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, then mention the constitutional aspect, expert opinions, Republican reactions, and the political context. I should also note that the idea is unconstitutional and could lead to legal battles.

Wait, I should also include that Trump's claim about the U.S. being the only country is false, and that he's using this for political gain, especially with the midterm elections approaching. Plus, some Republicans support this, like Lindsey Graham, but others, like Paul Ryan, oppose it.

I think I have all the main points. Now I'll structure them into a coherent summary, making sure to include the moral implications, such as the impact on children and the divisiveness of the issue.

SUMMARY: President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment, which experts say cannot be changed without a constitutional amendment. Trump claims it can be done via executive order, though many, including some Republicans, oppose this idea. He argues the policy is "ridiculous" and unique to the U.S., though over 30 countries have similar policies. Trump's proposal, ahead of the midterm elections, aims to stir fear about immigration, particularly regarding a caravan of Central American migrants. Critics, including the ACLU, call the plan unconstitutional and divisive. Some Republicans support ending birthright citizenship, while others, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, oppose it. Trump's rhetoric and actions reflect a broader strategy to influence the election by targeting immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
