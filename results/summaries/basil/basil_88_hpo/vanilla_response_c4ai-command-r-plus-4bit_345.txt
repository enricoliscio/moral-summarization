SUMMARY: President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Axios on HBO that he is considering issuing an executive order to revoke the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump claimed that he could bypass the need for a constitutional amendment and achieve this change through an act of Congress or an executive order. This statement has been met with criticism and skepticism from various Republicans and legal experts, who argue that such a move would exceed the president's authority and be unconstitutional. Despite this, Trump maintains that the current system is "ridiculous" and needs to end. The announcement aligns with Trump's previous stance on immigration and his focus on the issue ahead of the midterm elections. It remains unclear if and how Trump will proceed with the executive order, and any such action would likely face legal challenges. The summary also mentions Senator Lindsey Graham's intention to introduce legislation supporting Trump's proposal and the potential for a legal battle if the executive order is enacted.

END OF SUMMARY.
