SUMMARY:

President Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that he can do this via executive order, despite most experts believing it would be unconstitutional. This move is part of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections, where he has vowed to remove undocumented immigrants from the country. The ACLU and many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized Trump's idea, stating that it would be outside the president's authority and would likely fail in a legal battle. Trump's attempt to erode birthright citizenship is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred.

END OF SUMMARY.
