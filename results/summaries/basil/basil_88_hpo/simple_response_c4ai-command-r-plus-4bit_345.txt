SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has once again demonstrated his disregard for the rights of immigrants and his willingness to trample over the Constitution in pursuit of his anti-immigrant agenda. In a recent interview, Trump stated his intention to issue an executive order eliminating the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. This move would be a blatant overreach of presidential power and has been rightly criticized by legal experts and politicians from both sides of the aisle.

Trump's claim that the US is the only country that offers citizenship to those born within its borders is patently false, and his suggestion that such a policy is "ridiculous" is offensive and dehumanizing. The potential consequences of such an order would be devastating, effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants and creating a system that further marginalizes and devalues those seeking a better life in our country.

Despite pushback from fellow Republicans and legal experts, Trump continues to push this and other anti-immigrant messaging in the lead-up to the midterm elections, stoking fear and hatred for political gain. It is essential to call out these immoral and unconstitutional actions and stand up for the rights of all people, regardless of their place of birth or citizenship status. END OF SUMMARY.
