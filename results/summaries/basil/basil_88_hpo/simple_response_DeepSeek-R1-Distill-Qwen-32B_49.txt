Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully.

President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims it can be done without a constitutional amendment, but experts say that's not possible. The article mentions that over 30 countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies, so Trump's claim that the U.S. is the only one is false.

I should note the opposition from Republicans like Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham, who either oppose the idea or suggest it's not feasible. Also, the ACLU points out that this move is unconstitutional and aims to divide the country ahead of the midterms.

Trump's history of supporting this change and his recent actions, like sending troops to the border and stoking fear about the migrant caravan, show his focus on immigration before the elections. The moral framing here is about the divisiveness and the potential harm to children of undocumented immigrants.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these key points: Trump's proposal, the constitutional issues, opposition from Republicans and experts, and the context of the midterms and migrant caravan. I'll structure it to highlight the moral implications and the legal challenges involved.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has floated the idea of using an executive order to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump claims this can be done without a constitutional amendment, though experts argue it cannot. The U.S. is not alone in granting birthright citizenship, with over 30 countries, including Canada and Mexico, doing the same. Trump's suggestion has been criticized by Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called it unconstitutional. The ACLU also condemned the proposal as a "blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and anti-immigrant hatred" ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's focus on immigration includes false claims about a migrant caravan and deploying troops to the border, further stoking fear. His proposal, which would likely face legal challenges, aligns with his long-standing opposition to birthright citizenship and his efforts to target undocumented immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
