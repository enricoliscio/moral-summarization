SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to consider an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that this change can be made via executive order, despite experts arguing that it would require a constitutional amendment. This move is seen as a blatant attempt to sow division and fan anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. The ACLU has stated that the president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment's citizenship guarantee is clear. Even some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized Trump's idea, calling it unconstitutional. This move is part of Trump's broader anti-immigrant agenda, which includes stoking fear about a migrant caravan and deploying troops to the border.

END OF SUMMARY.
