SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has threatened to sign an executive order to remove birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, claiming it's "ridiculous" and needs to "come to an end". This attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants aligns with his anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections. Trump falsely stated that the US is the only country offering citizenship to those born within its borders, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. Experts argue that such an executive order would be unconstitutional and would likely fail in a legal battle. Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized Trump's idea, stating that it's outside the president's authority. Trump's vow to try is seen as a blatant attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred. His actions and messaging have been stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading towards the US-Mexico border.

END OF SUMMARY.
