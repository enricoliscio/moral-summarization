SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that he can make this change via executive order, despite most experts believing it would require a constitutional amendment. The president has falsely stated that the US is the only country to offer birthright citizenship, when in fact over 30 countries have similar policies. This move is seen as part of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of the midterm elections. Many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have criticized the idea, stating that it would be outside the president's authority. If Trump follows through, it would likely lead to a legal battle, which most experts think he would lose.
