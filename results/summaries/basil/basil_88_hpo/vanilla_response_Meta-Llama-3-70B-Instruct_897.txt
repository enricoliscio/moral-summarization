SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering issuing an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents. This right is currently guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Trump claims that he can make this change via executive order, despite many experts arguing that it would require a constitutional amendment. The move is seen as a way to punish the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have spoken out against the idea, saying it would be outside the president's authority. The move is likely to spark a legal battle, with most experts believing the president would fail. The announcement is seen as part of Trump's efforts to stoke fear about immigration ahead of the midterm elections.
