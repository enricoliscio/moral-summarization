SUMMARY: President Trump has suggested that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens. This right is currently enshrined in the 14th Amendment, and most legal experts believe that it could only be changed through a constitutional amendment. Trump's proposal has been met with criticism and skepticism, with many arguing that it is an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Some Republicans, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Carlos Curbelo, have stated that such a change would require an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment, not an executive order. However, there are also experts who disagree, arguing that the 14th Amendment has been misapplied. The proposal aligns with Trump's previous messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants and stoking fear about caravans of migrants heading towards the U.S.-Mexico border. The president's vow to end birthright citizenship is likely to face legal challenges and has been criticized as unconstitutional by the ACLU and other organizations.
