SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that this can be done via executive order, despite experts saying it would require a constitutional amendment. He calls the current system "ridiculous" and says it "has to end." This move is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that this would be a blatant and unconstitutional attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants. Even some Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, saying it's outside the president's authority. Trump's vow to try aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants, including stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading towards the U.S.-Mexico border.
