SUMMARY:

President Trump has vowed to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, calling the current system "ridiculous" and claiming it "has to end." He believes he can do so via executive order, despite experts and fellow Republicans arguing it would require a constitutional amendment. This move is seen as an attempt to "sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred" ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's statement is also filled with false claims, such as the U.S. being the only country to offer birthright citizenship, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies.

Many experts, including the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project director, argue that the president cannot "erase the Constitution with an executive order" and that the 14th Amendment's citizenship guarantee is clear. Some Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have also shot down Trump's idea, calling it unconstitutional. However, some experts and politicians, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, disagree and support ending birthright citizenship.

END OF SUMMARY.
