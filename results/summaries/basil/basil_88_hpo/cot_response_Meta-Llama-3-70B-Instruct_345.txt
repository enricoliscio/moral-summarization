SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a move he calls "ridiculous" and claims would "end" the current system. However, this move is seen as "blatantly unconstitutional" and an attempt to "sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred" by critics. Trump's plan would effectively "punish" the children of undocumented immigrants, whom he has vowed to remove from the country. Many experts believe the president would fail in a legal battle, citing the 14th Amendment's citizenship guarantee. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, calling instead for immigration reform that makes the country "more secure" and reaffirms its "wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants."
