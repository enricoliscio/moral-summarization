SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has vowed to consider an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump claims that this "ridiculous" system "has to end" and that he can do so via executive order, despite most experts believing this would be unconstitutional. This attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections is a blatant attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants. Even some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, stating that birthright citizenship cannot be ended with an executive order. Trump's vow to try aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants, including his false claims about the caravan of migrants and his threat to cut off aid to Central American countries. This move is a transparent and unconstitutional attempt to reshape the U.S. and perpetuate anti-immigrant sentiment. END OF SUMMARY.
