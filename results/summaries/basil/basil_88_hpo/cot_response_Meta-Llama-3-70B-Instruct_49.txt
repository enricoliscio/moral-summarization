SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, calling the current system "ridiculous" and claiming it's a "magnet for illegal immigration." This move would effectively punish the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Many experts argue that such an order would be unconstitutional and a blatant attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred ahead of the midterm elections. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have shot down Trump's idea, saying it's outside the president's authority. Trump's vow to try aligns with his other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants, and would likely ensure a legal battle. END OF SUMMARY.
