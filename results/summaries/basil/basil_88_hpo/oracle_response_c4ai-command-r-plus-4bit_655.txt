SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has stated that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens. This right is currently enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and could only be changed through a constitutional amendment. Trump, however, believes that he can execute this change with an act of Congress or even an executive order. This statement has been criticized by many, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that the president cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. Rep. Carlos Curbelo also criticized the president's statement, calling for immigration reform that makes the country more secure while also reaffirming its tradition as a nation of immigrants. The president's attempt to remove birthright citizenship has been framed as punishing the children of undocumented immigrants and sowing division by stoking fear and claiming that the caravan of migrants heading to the U.S. is filled with criminals and gang members. The president's action, if carried out, would likely result in a legal battle, with most experts believing that the president would fail to overturn the Supreme Court's previous ruling on the matter.
END OF SUMMARY.
