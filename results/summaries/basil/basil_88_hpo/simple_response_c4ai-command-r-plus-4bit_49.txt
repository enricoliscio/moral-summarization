SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. This move would be blatantly immoral and unconstitutional, as it would effectively punish innocent children for the actions of their parents and deny them the basic rights and protections afforded to U.S. citizens. It also aligns with Trump's other immoral and inhumane actions and rhetoric targeting undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections.

Trump's proposal has been widely criticized by legal and moral experts, as well as some Republicans, who have emphasized that such a change would require a constitutional amendment and that the president cannot simply erase the Constitution with an executive order. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has called it "a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred." Despite this, Trump continues to stoke fear and spread falsehoods about immigration, including claims about a caravan of migrants from Central America, as part of his cruel and divisive agenda. 

END OF SUMMARY.
