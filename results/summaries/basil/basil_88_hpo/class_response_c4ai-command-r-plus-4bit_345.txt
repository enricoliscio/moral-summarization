SUMMARY: President Trump has threatened to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents through an executive order, claiming that he can "definitely do it with an act of Congress." This statement has been met with criticism and doubts from fellow Republicans and legal experts, who argue that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. Trump's attempt to erase birthright citizenship aligns with his other anti-immigrant statements and actions leading up to the midterm elections, including his false claims about the caravan of migrants and threats to cut aid to Central American countries. The president's vow to end birthright citizenship would punish the children of undocumented immigrants and would likely result in a legal battle, with most experts believing that the president would fail to uphold the Constitution. This action is seen as an attempt to sow division and fan the flames of hatred towards immigrants. However, some Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, support the idea and plan to introduce similar legislation.
