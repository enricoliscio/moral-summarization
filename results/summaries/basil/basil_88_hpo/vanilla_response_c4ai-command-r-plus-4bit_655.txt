SUMMARY: President Donald Trump stated that he is considering issuing an executive order to revoke the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump believes that the policy of birthright citizenship is "ridiculous" and needs to end, despite legal experts arguing that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. This statement aligns with Trump's previous stance on immigration and his focus on stoking fears about undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections. Trump's claim that the U.S. is the only country with such a policy is false, as over 30 nations have similar laws. The announcement has faced criticism from both legal experts and some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that birthright citizenship cannot be ended by executive order. However, some constitutional law experts disagree, arguing that the 14th Amendment has been misapplied. The potential executive order would likely face legal challenges, and its outcome is uncertain. This move by Trump is seen as an attempt to appeal to his base and further his anti-immigrant agenda.

END OF SUMMARY.
