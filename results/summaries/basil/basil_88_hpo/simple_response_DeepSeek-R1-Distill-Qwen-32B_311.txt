Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

First, Trump claims he can end birthright citizenship via an executive order, which the 14th Amendment currently protects. He thinks it's "ridiculous" and says the U.S. is the only country with this policy, but that's not true since over 30 countries do the same. He also mentioned that it's a magnet for illegal immigration and wants to change it before the midterm elections.

The article mentions that changing the 14th Amendment would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive order. Experts, like the ACLU, say this is unconstitutional and just a way to divide people and stir up anti-immigrant sentiment. Some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, disagree with Trump, saying it's not possible. Others, like Lindsey Graham, support the idea but acknowledge it might need a constitutional amendment.

Trump has a history of wanting to end birthright citizenship, and he's using immigration as a campaign issue, especially with the caravan of migrants approaching the border. He's making false claims about the caravan, which seems to be part of his strategy to rally his base before the elections.

So, the moral framing here is that Trump's proposal is unconstitutional, uses fear to divide, targets vulnerable children, and is politically motivated. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should structure it by stating Trump's claim, the constitutional issues, the opposition, the political context, and the implications. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects like divisiveness, targeting children, and political manipulation.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: President Trump has suggested using an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment. Despite claims that this can be done without a constitutional amendment, experts argue it is unconstitutional. Trump's proposal, which he believes is unique to the U.S., has been criticized as a divisive and politically motivated move, targeting undocumented immigrants and their children. Some Republicans oppose the idea, while others support it but acknowledge the need for a constitutional change. Trump's focus on immigration ahead of the midterm elections, including false claims about a migrant caravan, underscores his strategy to exploit fear and rally support. His proposal has been condemned as an attempt to sow division and undermine the U.S. as a nation of immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
