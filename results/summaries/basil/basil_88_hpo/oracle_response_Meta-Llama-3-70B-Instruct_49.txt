SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Trump falsely stated that the U.S. is the only country that offers citizenship to those born here, when in fact over 30 nations have similar policies. This move is seen as an attempt to punish the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Many experts, including the ACLU, believe that the president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order and that the 14th Amendment's citizenship guarantee is clear. Trump's vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections, stoking fear and division. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have quickly shot down Trump's idea, calling it unconstitutional. END OF SUMMARY.
