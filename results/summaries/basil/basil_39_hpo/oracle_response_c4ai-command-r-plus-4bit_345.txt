SUMMARY: Love and freedom were at the heart of a recent dispute between sisters Mary and Liz Cheney, with Mary criticizing Liz's opposition to same-sex marriage. In a Facebook post, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, expressed her love for her sister but asserted that her stance on the issue was "dead wrong." She emphasized that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. Meanwhile, Liz Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi in the Republican primary in Wyoming, clarified her position as strongly "pro-life" and not "pro-gay marriage." She believes the decision on marriage should rest with the people in the states, not with judges or legislators. This puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has previously expressed support for gay marriage, emphasizing freedom and the right to choose for all. END OF SUMMARY.
