SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook, stating "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage." Mary emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, saying she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage," and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people. This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports gay marriage, saying "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone... people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish."
