Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney, the sister of Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary is openly gay and married, so her stance is personal. She emphasizes freedom for everyone, including all family types. Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided by states and the people. She's running against Mike Enzi in the primary. Previously, Liz opposed "don't ask, don't tell." There's also a mention of a poll where she was misrepresented, and her father, Dick Cheney, supports gay marriage, which contrasts with her stance.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should highlight the moral aspects, like Mary's emphasis on freedom and equality, and Liz's stance on states' rights. Also, the contrast with their father's support is important for the moral framing.

Let me structure this: start with Mary's criticism, her personal background, her argument for equality. Then Liz's opposition, her political stance, and the context of the primary. Mention the poll and her father's support to show the family dynamic and differing opinions.

I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it, ensuring each point is covered without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a Facebook post, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights. Liz Cheney, who opposes same-sex marriage, argued that the issue should be decided by states and their people, not judges or legislators. This stance puts her at odds with her openly gay sister and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has supported gay marriage. Liz, who is running in the Republican primary against Sen. Mike Enzi, previously opposed the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Her position also contrasts with her father's belief in freedom for all, including his acknowledgment of his daughter's sexuality. END OF SUMMARY.
