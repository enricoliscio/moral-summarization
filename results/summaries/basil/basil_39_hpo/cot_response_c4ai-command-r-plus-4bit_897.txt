SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance against same-sex marriage. In a Facebook post, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, wrote, "Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families—regardless of how they look or how they are made—are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Mary's statement came in response to Liz Cheney's declaration that she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage." Liz Cheney believes that the "issue of marriage must be decided by the states and by the people themselves." This position puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has voiced support for gay marriage in the past. He stated, "I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish," highlighting his belief in freedom and equality for all families. Liz Cheney's opposition to same-sex marriage has sparked controversy, with her sister and father taking a moral stand for the rights and freedom of LGBT individuals and families.
