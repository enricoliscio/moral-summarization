SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney wrote, "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage... Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, stated that she is "strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage," believing that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports gay marriage, saying "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone... I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish." END OF SUMMARY.
