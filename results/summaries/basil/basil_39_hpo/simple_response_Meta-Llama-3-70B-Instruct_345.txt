SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. In contrast, Liz Cheney stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators. This stance puts Liz Cheney at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of equality, freedom, and family values. It also raises questions about the role of personal relationships and experiences in shaping one's political beliefs and values.
