SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney had issued a statement saying she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people. Mary Cheney responded, saying "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, deserve the same rights and protections. This puts Liz Cheney at odds with their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who expressed support for gay marriage in 2009. Mary Cheney, who married her partner in Washington, D.C. last year, emphasized her love for her sister while strongly disagreeing with her stance on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
