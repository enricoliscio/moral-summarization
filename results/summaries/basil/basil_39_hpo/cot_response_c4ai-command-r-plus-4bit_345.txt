SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, wrote: "Freedom means freedom for everyone. All families are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, voiced her strong pro-life stance and opposition to gay marriage, believing that the issue should be decided by the people in the states, not by judges or legislators. She sought to clarify her position after a poll allegedly stated she "supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage." This puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has offered support for gay marriage in the past, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that people should be free to enter into any kind of union they wish. Mary Cheney's rebuke highlights the moral disagreement within the Cheney family, with Mary advocating for equality and freedom, while Liz Cheney takes a more conservative approach, prioritizing state's rights and a pro-life agenda.
