SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public statement. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, asserted that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights. Liz Cheney, however, voiced her strong opposition to gay marriage, stating that the issue should be decided by the people in the states and not by judges or legislators. This position not only contradicts her sister's beliefs but also puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has publicly supported gay marriage in the past. He affirmed his belief in freedom for all individuals to enter into any union they desire, regardless of their sexual orientation. Mary Cheney's courageous stand against her sister's regressive views highlights the ongoing struggle for equality and the need for all families to be treated with fairness and respect, regardless of their makeup.

END OF SUMMARY.
