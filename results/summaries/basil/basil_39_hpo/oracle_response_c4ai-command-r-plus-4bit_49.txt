SUMMARY: In a recent Facebook post, Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, expressed her belief in freedom and equal rights for all families, regardless of their composition. She rebuked her sister's statement opposing same-sex marriage and asserting that the issue should be decided by the states and their people. Liz Cheney's stance is at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage, citing freedom and the right to choose for all. Mary Cheney's love for her sister is clear, but she stands firm in her belief that her sister is wrong on the issue of marriage equality. She asserts that all families should be entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges, regardless of how they are formed. This moral disagreement highlights the complex dynamics within the Cheney family, with Mary Cheney advocating for freedom and equality, and her sister taking a more conservative approach.
