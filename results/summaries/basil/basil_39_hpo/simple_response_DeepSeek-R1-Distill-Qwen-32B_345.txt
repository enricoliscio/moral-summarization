Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's opposition to same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand all the details.

Mary Cheney is the younger sister of Liz and the daughter of Dick Cheney. She's openly gay and married her partner Heather Poe in Washington, DC last year. She posted on Facebook criticizing Liz's stance, saying that freedom should apply to everyone and all families deserve equal rights. Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage and believes it should be decided by the states, not judges or legislators. She's running in the Republican primary against Sen. Mike Enzi. Previously, she opposed the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. There was a poll that suggested she supports abortion and gay marriage, but she clarified her position. Her stance is also against her father's views, as Dick Cheney supported gay marriage in 2009, emphasizing freedom for everyone.

Now, I need to create a summary that's no longer than 200 words. I should include the key points: who Mary and Liz are, their positions on same-sex marriage, their relationship, the moral arguments each makes, and the context of their political and family dynamics.

I should start by introducing both sisters and their relationship. Then, mention Mary's criticism of Liz's stance, including her moral argument about freedom and equality. Next, detail Liz's position, her reasoning about states' rights, and her political context. Include the clarification after the poll and the fact that this puts her at odds with her father, who supports same-sex marriage.

I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so highlighting the concepts of freedom, equality, and family values is important. I should also note the political implications, like Liz's primary race and her previous stance on "don't ask, don't tell."

I'll structure the summary to flow from Mary's criticism to Liz's response, then to the broader context involving their father and political implications. Keeping it concise but covering all necessary points.

Let me draft the summary step by step:

1. Introduce Mary and Liz Cheney, their relationship, and Mary's stance.
2. Detail Mary's moral argument about freedom and equality.
3. Present Liz's opposition, her reasoning, and political context.
4. Mention the poll and Liz's clarification.
5. Note the conflict with their father's support for same-sex marriage.
6. Conclude with the family's stance on LGBTQ+ issues.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Also, make sure to include all key elements without making it too lengthy.

Wait, I should also mention that Mary is married and her personal experience as a gay individual, which adds weight to her argument. Liz's stance is part of her pro-life and traditional views, which contrasts with her sister and father.

I think that's all the necessary information. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary, making sure each point flows logically to the next.
