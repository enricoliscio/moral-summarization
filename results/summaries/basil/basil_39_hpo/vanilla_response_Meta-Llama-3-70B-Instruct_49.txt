SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney had stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people. Mary Cheney, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, wrote that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. This puts Liz Cheney at odds with their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who expressed support for gay marriage in 2009. Mary Cheney's post was a response to her sister's statement, which was issued to clarify her position after a poll suggested she supported abortion and gay marriage. The disagreement highlights a divide within the Cheney family on the issue of same-sex marriage.
