SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public statement. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, defended the freedom and equality of all families, regardless of their composition. She asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families should be entitled to the same rights. In contrast, Liz Cheney issued a statement voicing her opposition to same-sex marriage, stating that she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage." She believes the issue should be decided by the people in the states rather than by judges or legislators. Liz Cheney's position puts her at odds with her sister and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has openly supported gay marriage in the past. He believes that people should be free to enter into any union they wish, regardless of sexual orientation. Liz Cheney sought to clarify her stance after facing criticism for allegedly supporting abortion and aggressively promoting gay marriage in Wyoming. END OF SUMMARY.
