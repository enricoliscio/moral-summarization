Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words used by the author. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married, criticized Liz on Facebook, saying she's wrong about same-sex marriage. She emphasized love and freedom for everyone. Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage, saying it's a state issue and that she's pro-life. She's running against Mike Enzi in the primary. Also, her father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, which puts Liz at odds with him.

The author used specific moral words: love, wrong, freedom, entitled, protections, prolife, decided, free, wish. I need to make sure these are included in the summary.

I should start by stating Mary's criticism, using "love" and "wrong." Then mention her stance on freedom and equality. Next, Liz's opposition, using "prolife" and her belief in states deciding. Also, include the conflict with their father, who supports same-sex marriage, using "wish" or "freedom."

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to cover both sisters' positions, their relationship, and the broader context of their father's stance. I should ensure that the moral terms are naturally integrated without forcing them.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each moral word is appropriately placed. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook, stating, "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage." Mary emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone," asserting that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, who opposes same-sex marriage, believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, not by judges or legislators. This stance puts Liz at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports same-sex marriage and has long advocated for freedom and equality. Liz's position also contradicts her previous opposition to the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Her campaign has faced scrutiny, including claims she supports abortion and promotes gay marriage, which she has sought to clarify. END OF SUMMARY.
