Okay, I need to help the user summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Mary Cheney criticized her sister Liz for opposing same-sex marriage. Mary is openly gay and married, so her stance is personal. She used words like "love," "wrong," and "freedom." Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage, emphasizing states' rights and being pro-life. She's running against Mike Enzi. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, which adds another layer of family conflict.

I should make sure to include the morally framed words: love, wrong, freedom, entitled, protections, prolife, decided, free, wish. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mary's criticism, her support for freedom and protections, then Liz's opposition and stance on states' rights. I'll mention the family dynamics, including Dick's support and the conflict it causes. I'll wrap it up by highlighting the broader debate on rights and equality.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. Let me structure it: introduce Mary's criticism, her moral stance, Liz's opposition, the political context, family dynamics, and the broader implications. Make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook, calling her stance "dead wrong." Mary emphasized the importance of "freedom for everyone," asserting that all families, regardless of how they are formed, are "entitled" to the same "rights, privileges, and protections." Liz Cheney, who is pro-life, defended her position, arguing that marriage should be "decided" by the people in the states rather than judges or legislators. This puts Liz at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has supported same-sex marriage, stating, "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone." The family's differing views highlight the ongoing moral and political debate over marriage equality and the "protections" afforded to all families. END OF SUMMARY.
