SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public statement, emphasizing her love for her sister but taking a strong stance on the issue. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, asserted that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. She rebuked her sister's statement, in which Liz Cheney voiced her anti-gay marriage stance, claiming that the issue should be decided by the people in the states, not by judges or legislators. Liz Cheney's position on same-sex marriage puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has publicly supported gay marriage and emphasized his belief in freedom for all, including his gay daughter. Mary Cheney's statement highlights the tension between personal beliefs and political stances within a family, with love and freedom as central values in the debate over gay rights and state decision-making.
END OF SUMMARY.
