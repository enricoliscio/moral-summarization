SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, wrote that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. This comes after Liz Cheney issued a statement opposing same-sex marriage, saying it should be decided by the states and people, not judges or legislators. The sisters' disagreement puts Liz Cheney at odds with their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who expressed support for gay marriage in 2009. Liz Cheney's stance also contradicts her previous support for repealing the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The controversy arises as Liz Cheney challenges Sen. Mike Enzi in next year's Republican primary.
