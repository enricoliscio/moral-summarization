Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is openly gay and married, so she's speaking out against her sister's opposition. She says on Facebook that Liz is wrong and that freedom should apply to everyone, including same-sex couples. 

Liz Cheney, who's running for the Senate, made a statement saying she's pro-life and against same-sex marriage, believing it's up to the states to decide. She's challenging Sen. Mike Enzi in the primary. Previously, she opposed the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. There was a poll suggesting she supports gay marriage, but she clarified her position. 

Interestingly, her father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage and has spoken about it, including mentioning his daughter Mary. So, the summary should include the main points: Mary's criticism, Liz's stance, the family dynamics, and the political implications.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to mention both sisters, their positions, the context of the election, and the father's support. Also, note that the sisters' views are at odds, which adds a personal angle to the political issue.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, argued that freedom should apply to all families, regardless of their composition. Liz Cheney, who is running in the Republican primary against Sen. Mike Enzi, stated she believes marriage decisions should be left to the states and opposes same-sex marriage. This puts Liz at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has supported same-sex marriage and acknowledged his daughter Mary's sexuality. Liz also sought to clarify her stance after a poll allegedly linked her to supporting gay marriage, though she remains pro-life. END OF SUMMARY.
