SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections" as every other. In contrast, Liz Cheney stated that she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage," believing that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has supported gay marriage since 2009, saying that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that people should be "free to enter into any kind of union they wish."
