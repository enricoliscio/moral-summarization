SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, wrote that she loves her sister but disagrees with her stance on marriage equality. She asserted that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their makeup, deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, issued a statement expressing her opposition to same-sex marriage and her belief that the issue should be decided by the states and their people. Mary Cheney's rebuke highlights a family divide, as their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has previously expressed support for gay marriage, citing freedom and equality. Liz Cheney's stance has drawn attention due to her sister's sexual orientation and her own previous criticism of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. She sought to clarify her position after facing allegations of supporting abortion and aggressively promoting gay marriage in Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
