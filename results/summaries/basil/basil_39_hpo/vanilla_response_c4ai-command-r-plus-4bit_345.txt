SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's recent statement opposing same-sex marriage. In a Facebook post, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement with her sister's stance. She emphasized that freedom should be for everyone and that all families, regardless of their form, deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, stated that she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage," believing that the issue should be decided by the people in the states rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney's public rebuttal puts her at odds with her sister and highlights a divide within the Cheney family, as their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has previously expressed support for gay marriage, citing freedom and equality.

END OF SUMMARY.
