SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney had issued a statement saying she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, wrote that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. This puts Liz Cheney at odds with their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who expressed support for gay marriage in 2009. Mary Cheney's post comes as her sister is challenging Sen. Mike Enzi in next year's Republican primary and is seeking to clarify her position after a poll suggested she supported abortion and gay marriage.

END OF SUMMARY.
