SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public statement, highlighting the moral values of freedom and equality for all families, regardless of their composition. Liz Cheney's stance against same-sex marriage and her attempt to distance herself from her previous support for gay rights put her at odds with her sister and father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who have both advocated for the freedom and rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. In her statement, Mary Cheney emphasized the importance of equal rights and freedoms for all families, regardless of how they are formed. She rebuked her sister's position, stating that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families deserve the same rights, privileges, and protections. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, defended her opposition by arguing that the issue of marriage should be decided by the people in the states, a stance that many see as an attempt to deny the fundamental rights and freedoms of LGBTQ+ individuals and families. This moral disagreement within the Cheney family highlights the ongoing debate and struggle for equal rights and freedoms for the LGBTQ+ community in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
