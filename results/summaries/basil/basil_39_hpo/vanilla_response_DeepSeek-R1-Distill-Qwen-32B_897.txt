Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. I need to make sure I capture all the key points without going over 200 words. Let me read through the article again to get the main details.

Mary Cheney is the younger sister of Liz and the daughter of Dick Cheney. She's openly gay and married, so that's important context. She posted on Facebook criticizing Liz, emphasizing freedom for everyone and equal rights for all families. Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage, saying it's a state issue and not for judges or legislators to decide. She's running against Mike Enzi in the primary. Also, Liz had previously opposed the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. There's a mention of a poll where she was alleged to support gay marriage, but she clarified her opposition. Interestingly, her father Dick supported gay marriage in 2009, which contrasts with her stance.

I should structure the summary to include who Mary and Liz are, their opposing views, the context of their family, and the political implications. I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main points without getting into too much detail. Also, I should end with the summary token as specified. Let me make sure to cover all these elements without exceeding the word limit.
