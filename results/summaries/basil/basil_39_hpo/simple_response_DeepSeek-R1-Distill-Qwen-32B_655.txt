Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married, criticized her sister Liz Cheney for opposing same-sex marriage. Liz is running for the Senate and made a statement against it, saying it should be decided by the states. Mary responded on Facebook, emphasizing freedom for everyone and equal rights for all families. She loves her sister but disagrees strongly on this issue.

Dick Cheney, their father, supports gay marriage, which contrasts with Liz's stance. Liz also opposes abortion and the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The article highlights the family's differing views on this issue.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points concisely, within 200 words. I should focus on the moral aspects, like Mary's emphasis on freedom and equality, and the contrast between the sisters and their father's views. I'll structure it to show the family's internal conflict over same-sex marriage.
