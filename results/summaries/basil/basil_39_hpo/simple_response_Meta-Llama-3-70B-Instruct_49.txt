SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve the same rights and protections. In contrast, Liz Cheney stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than judges or legislators. This stance puts Liz Cheney at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage. The moral framing of this issue is clear: equality, freedom, and the rights of all individuals and families should be respected and protected, regardless of their sexual orientation or family structure. By opposing same-sex marriage, Liz Cheney is denying these fundamental rights to her own sister and countless others.

END OF SUMMARY.
