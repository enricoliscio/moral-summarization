SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's recent statement opposing same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement on Facebook, stating that freedom means freedom for everyone, including the right to marriage for all families, regardless of their composition. Liz Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, clarified her position on Friday, stating that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the people in the states, not by judges or legislators. This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has previously expressed support for gay marriage, citing freedom and the belief that people should be free to enter into any union they wish. Mary Cheney's public rebuttal highlights the family's differing views on the issue of same-sex marriage and adds a personal dimension to the political debate surrounding it. 

END OF SUMMARY.
