SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney wrote, "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone... all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." This comes after Liz Cheney stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and people, not judges or legislators. Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, had previously expressed support for gay marriage, saying "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone... people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish." The disagreement highlights the importance of freedom, love, and protections for all families, regardless of how they are made.
