SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's recent statement opposing same-sex marriage. In a Facebook post, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement with her sister's stance. She emphasized that freedom should be for everyone and that all families, regardless of their form, deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, affirmed her opposition to same-sex marriage, stating that the issue should be decided by the people in the states rather than by judges or legislators. This position contrasts with that of her father, who previously expressed support for gay marriage, stating that people should be free to enter into any union they choose. The disagreement between the Cheney sisters highlights the ongoing debate within the Republican Party regarding same-sex marriage and the role of government in defining marriage.
