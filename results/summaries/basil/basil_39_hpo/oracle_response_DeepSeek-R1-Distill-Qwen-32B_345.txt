Okay, I need to summarize the news article provided, making sure to preserve the moral framing as given by the author. The user has specified that I should include as many of the morally framed words as possible, which are: love, wrong, freedom, entitled, protections, prolife, decided, free, wish.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Mary Cheney, the sister of Liz Cheney, criticized Liz's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary is openly gay and married, so her stance is personal. She used the word "love" for her sister but called her stance "wrong." She emphasized "freedom" for everyone and that all families are "entitled" to the same rights and "protections."

Liz Cheney, on the other hand, is pro-life and opposes same-sex marriage, believing that marriage should be decided by the states. She's running against Mike Enzi in the primary. She's also against the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which is another moral stance. Her father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, which contrasts with her position.

I need to include all these points concisely, using the moral words where appropriate. I'll structure the summary to first mention Mary's criticism, her arguments, then Liz's stance and the context of her political campaign and family dynamics.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and ends with the specified tokens. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is included where it fits naturally.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook, calling her stance "wrong." Mary emphasized "freedom" for all families, stating they are "entitled" to the same rights and "protections." Liz Cheney, who is "pro-life," believes marriage should be "decided" by states, not judges or legislators. This puts her at odds with her father, Dick Cheney, who supports same-sex marriage, saying "freedom means freedom for everyone." Liz's position also contrasts with her past opposition to the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Her stance aligns with her "pro-life" views but conflicts with her family's evolving attitudes toward LGBTQ+ rights. END OF SUMMARY.
