Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is openly gay and married, so she's pretty vocal about this. She posted on Facebook saying she loves her sister but disagrees with her on marriage rights. She emphasizes that freedom should apply to everyone, including all types of families.

Liz Cheney, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage. She believes that states should decide the issue, not the federal government. She's running against Mike Enzi in the primary, and her position is also at odds with her father, Dick Cheney, who supported gay marriage back in 2009. The article mentions a poll that supposedly said Liz supports gay marriage, but she's clarifying her stance against it.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main points: who Mary and Liz are, their relationship, Mary's criticism, their opposing views on same-sex marriage, Liz's stance on states' rights, and the conflict with their father's previous support. Also, the mention of the poll and her opposition to "don't ask, don't tell" might be important.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Mary and Liz, then their opposing views, and the context of their family's stance on the issue. Keeping it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but cover all key points. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary, who is married to Heather Poe, emphasized that freedom should apply to all families, regardless of their makeup. Liz Cheney, who opposes same-sex marriage, believes the issue should be decided by states, not the federal government. This puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supported gay marriage in 2009. Liz is running in the Republican primary against Sen. Mike Enzi and has previously opposed the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Her stance also contradicts claims from a Wyoming poll that suggested she supports same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
