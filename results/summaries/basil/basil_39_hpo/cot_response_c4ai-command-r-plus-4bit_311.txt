SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a public statement. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone." She believes that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections. In contrast, Liz Cheney issued a statement voicing her opposition to same-sex marriage, stating that she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage." She believes the issue should be decided by the states and the people themselves. Liz Cheney's position puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has publicly supported same-sex marriage and the freedom for individuals to enter into any union they wish. The elder Cheney daughter is challenging incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, and her stance on same-sex marriage has become a contentious issue in the campaign. Mary Cheney's rebuke highlights the moral and personal dimensions of the debate over marriage equality, with family members taking opposing sides on the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
