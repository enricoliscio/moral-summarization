SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, took to Facebook to rebuke her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary, who is openly gay and married, wrote "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage." She emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, issued a statement voicing her opposition to same-sex marriage, saying she is "strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage." Their father, Dick Cheney, has previously expressed support for gay marriage, saying "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone... people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish." The sisters' disagreement highlights the importance of upholding freedom and equality for all individuals and families.
