SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public statement, highlighting the discrepancy between their views on freedom and love. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. On the other hand, Liz Cheney voiced her stance as strongly "pro-life" and against gay marriage, believing that the matter should be decided by the people of the states and not by legislators or judges. This position puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage in the past, citing freedom and the belief that people should be free to enter into any union they wish. Mary Cheney's statement emphasizes love and the entitlement of equal rights, while Liz Cheney's stance focuses on state decision-making and a pro-life perspective. The disagreement between the sisters showcases a complex interplay of personal values and political beliefs.

END OF SUMMARY.
