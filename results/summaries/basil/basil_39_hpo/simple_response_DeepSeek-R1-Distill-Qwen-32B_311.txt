Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is openly gay and married, so her perspective is personal. She emphasizes freedom for everyone, including all family structures. Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage and believes states should decide. She's running for the Senate and had previously opposed "don't ask, don't tell."

I should note that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage, which contrasts with Liz's position. The moral framing here is about freedom and equality versus state rights. It's important to highlight the family dynamics and the political implications.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to include both sisters' statements, their relationship, and the broader context of their father's stance. I should ensure that the moral arguments are clear: Mary's emphasis on equality and Liz's focus on state sovereignty.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll also ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a Facebook post, calling her stance "dead wrong." Mary emphasized that freedom should apply to everyone, including all family structures. Liz Cheney, who is running in the Republican primary, defended her position, stating that marriage should be decided by the states and their people, not judges or legislators. Liz's stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has supported same-sex marriage, arguing that freedom means equality for all. The sisters' differing views highlight a family divide over LGBTQ+ rights, with Mary advocating for universal rights and Liz advocating for state sovereignty. END OF SUMMARY.
