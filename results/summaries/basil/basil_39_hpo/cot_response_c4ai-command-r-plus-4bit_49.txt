STEP 1:
* freedom
* rights
* privileges
* protections 

SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance against same-sex marriage in a public Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and recently married her partner, Heather Poe, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone." She advocated for all families, regardless of their composition, to be entitled to the same *rights, privileges*, and *protections*. In contrast, Liz Cheney stated her opposition to same-sex marriage, believing that the decision should be left to the states and their citizens rather than legislators or judges. Liz Cheney's position is at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage in the past, emphasizing that *freedom* entails the liberty to choose one's union. Mary Cheney's stance aligns with her father's, highlighting a family divide on the moral issue of same-sex marriage *END OF SUMMARY.*
