SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, stated that she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of equality, freedom, and family values. It also underscores the need for public figures to uphold these values, especially when they have personal connections to the issues at hand.
