SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her sister's recent statement opposing same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who married her partner last year, asserted that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their makeup, deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney's stance against same-sex marriage and her attempt to distance herself from her previous views on abortion and gay rights have been met with criticism. Her views also contradict those of their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has publicly supported gay marriage, citing freedom and his own experience as the father of a gay daughter. In her statement, Liz Cheney argued that the issue of marriage should be decided by the people in the states, not by judges or legislators. This intra-family conflict highlights the ongoing debate within the Republican Party over social issues, with some seeking to uphold traditional values while others advocate for greater inclusion and freedom.
