SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary stated that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, saying she is "strongly pro-life" and not "pro-gay marriage." This stance puts her at "odds" with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports gay marriage, believing that people should be "free to enter into any kind of union they wish." The disagreement highlights the differing moral values within the Cheney family. END OF SUMMARY.
