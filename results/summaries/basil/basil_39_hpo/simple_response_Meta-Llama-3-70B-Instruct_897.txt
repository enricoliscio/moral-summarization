SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve the same rights and protections. This moral stance is rooted in the principle of equality and fairness. In contrast, Liz Cheney voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, stating that the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. This position is at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of standing up for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or family structure. It also underscores the need for political leaders to uphold the values of equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
