SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney wrote, "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." Liz Cheney voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, stating, "I am strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage." This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports gay marriage, saying, "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone... people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish."
