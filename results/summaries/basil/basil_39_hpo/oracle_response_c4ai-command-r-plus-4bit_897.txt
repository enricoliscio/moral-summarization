SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a public statement, expressing her love for her sister but asserting that she is "dead wrong" on the issue. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, emphasized the importance of freedom and equal rights for all families, regardless of their composition. She believes that all families should be entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. In contrast, Liz Cheney stated her opposition to same-sex marriage, asserting that the issue should be decided by the people in the states rather than by judges or legislators. Liz Cheney's stance on gay marriage puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for gay marriage in the past, citing freedom as a fundamental value. Liz Cheney also clarified her pro-life position and her opposition to abortion.

END OF SUMMARY.
