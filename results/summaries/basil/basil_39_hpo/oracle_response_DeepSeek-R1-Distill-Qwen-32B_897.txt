Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's needed.

The user provided a news article about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. They also listed the morally framed words the author used: love, wrong, freedom, entitled, protections, prolife, decided, free, wish. The task is to create a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read the article carefully to grasp the key points. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married, criticized her sister Liz on Facebook. She used strong moral language, emphasizing love and freedom. Liz, on the other hand, opposes same-sex marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states. She's running for Senate, and her stance is at odds with her father, Dick Cheney, who supports same-sex marriage.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Mary's criticism, using "love" and "wrong." Then, I'll highlight her points about freedom and entitlement to protections. Next, I'll note Liz's pro-life stance and her belief that marriage should be decided by the states. It's important to include that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage, using "wish" as he mentioned people should be free to enter any union they wish.

I should keep the summary concise, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Mary's criticism, her arguments, Liz's opposing views, and the contrast with their father's stance. I'll make sure to include all the key moral words without forcing them in unnaturally.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each sentence incorporates the necessary terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to make sure it's clear and captures the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook, calling her stance "wrong." Mary emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone," asserting that all families, regardless of their composition, are "entitled" to the same rights, privileges, and protections. Liz Cheney, who is "pro-life," argued that the issue of marriage should be "decided" by the states and their people, not by judges or legislators. This puts Liz at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has expressed support for same-sex marriage, stating, "I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish." Mary's statement highlights the moral divide within the Cheney family over issues of love, freedom, and equality. END OF SUMMARY.
