SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, took to Facebook to criticize her sister's recent remarks opposing same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner last year, wrote that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of their makeup, are entitled to the same rights. Liz Cheney's statement against same-sex marriage puts her at odds with her sister and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has previously expressed support for gay marriage, believing that people should be free to enter into any union they wish. Liz Cheney's stance on the issue has been clarified as one of state decision-making rather than individual rights, but it has sparked controversy within her family and potentially with her constituents, as she challenges the incumbent Republican senator in the primary election.

END OF SUMMARY.
