SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook, saying "I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage." Mary Cheney emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections as every other." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, stating she is "strongly pro-life and not pro-gay marriage." She believes the issue of marriage should be "decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves." This stance puts her at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports gay marriage, saying "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone... people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish."
