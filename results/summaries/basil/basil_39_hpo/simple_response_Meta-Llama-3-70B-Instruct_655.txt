SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage on Facebook. Mary Cheney emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their composition, deserve equal rights and protections. This moral stance is in stark contrast to Liz Cheney's statement, which voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage and advocated for states to decide the issue. The sisters' disagreement highlights a fundamental question about the nature of freedom and equality. Mary Cheney's words echo her father's 2009 statement in support of gay marriage, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and family equality. The moral framing of this story underscores the importance of recognizing and respecting the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or family structure. END OF SUMMARY.
