Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is openly gay and married, so she's taking a strong stand. Liz, on the other hand, is against same-sex marriage and thinks states should decide. 

I need to make sure I capture the key points: who is involved, their positions, and any relevant background. Mary's Facebook post is important because it's a direct rebuke. She emphasizes freedom for everyone. Liz's statement about states' rights and her pro-life stance are also crucial. 

Additionally, the article mentions Liz's primary challenge against Mike Enzi and her past opposition to "don't ask, don't tell." It's also notable that her father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, which contrasts with Liz's position. 

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by introducing both sisters and their opposing views. Then, mention their backgrounds and the implications of their stances. I'll make sure to highlight the contrast between Liz and her father's positions. 

I need to avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me structure it so each main point is addressed in a few sentences. I'll make sure to include the quotes from Mary and Dick Cheney to emphasize their points. 

Also, I should note that the summary needs to be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly without using any special formatting. 

Let me put it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all the essential elements without getting too detailed. I think that's a solid approach.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the openly gay sister of Wyoming U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary, who is married to her partner Heather Poe, argued that freedom means equal rights for all families, regardless of their makeup. Liz Cheney, a pro-life Republican candidate challenging Sen. Mike Enzi, stated that marriage should be decided by the states and opposes same-sex marriage. This stance puts Liz at odds with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports gay marriage and has spoken about his family's acceptance of his daughter's sexuality. Liz's position also contrasts with her past opposition to the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The sisters' differing views highlight a family divide on LGBTQ+ rights. END OF SUMMARY.
