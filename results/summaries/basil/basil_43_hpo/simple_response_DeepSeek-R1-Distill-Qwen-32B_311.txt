Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rep. Bruce Braley making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley, leading to backlash. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Braley's comments at a fundraiser, the contrast between their backgrounds, the release by a conservative PAC, the media coverage, apologies, and the implications for the Senate race.

I should maintain the moral elements, like the criticism of Grassley's background and the subsequent fallout. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Braley's comments, the context, the reaction, the apologies, and the political impact. Make sure to include that Grassley is a farmer without a law background and Braley's legal experience.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts while highlighting the moral framing—criticism of Grassley's qualifications and the resulting political consequences.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), a candidate for the Senate, faced backlash after criticizing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a fundraiser. Braley, a lawyer, contrasted his background with Grassley's, a farmer without a law degree, suggesting Grassley was unqualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Conservative group America Rising released the remarks, sparking criticism. Media outlets highlighted the controversy, and Braley apologized to Grassley, emphasizing his own rural roots. Grassley, who often highlights his farming background in the Senate, has no legal training. Braley’s race is pivotal in the Senate control battle.  
END OF SUMMARY.
