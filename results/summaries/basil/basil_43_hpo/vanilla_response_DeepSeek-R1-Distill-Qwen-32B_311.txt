Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bruce Braley. Let me read through it carefully. 

So, the article talks about Braley, who's running to replace Sen. Tom Harkin. He made some critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a fundraiser. He mentioned Grassley's background, pointing out that Grassley is a farmer without a law degree. That was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising. 

Then, the backlash started. The Des Moines Register and Quad-City Times covered it, and Mark Jacobs, a Republican candidate, used it in a radio ad. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and also put out a statement emphasizing his family's farming roots. Grassley is a farmer and often mentions being the only non-lawyer on the Judiciary Committee. Braley has a law background, so this contrast was key. The race is important for the Senate control.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Braley's comments, the backlash, his apology, and the significance of the race. I should make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the main elements without getting too detailed.
