Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that the author used words like "help" and "offended," so I need to make sure those are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Braley criticized Sen. Grassley, pointing out Grassley's lack of legal background. This was during a fundraiser, and it was released by a conservative PAC. There was backlash, including a radio ad from Mark Jacobs, and local papers covered it. Braley apologized, emphasizing his farming roots.

I need to make the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the tough coverage Braley faced. Then, include the fundraiser context, his criticism of Grassley, the PAC's role, and the Republican response. Highlight his apology, focusing on the moral words "help" and "offended." Also, note Grassley's background and Braley's legal experience, ending with the significance of the race.

I should ensure the summary flows well, keeping it clear and within the word limit. Make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Check that the moral framing is preserved by using "help" and "offended" as specified.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after remarks at a January fundraiser criticizing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a farmer and non-lawyer on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley urged attorneys to "help" him win the race, contrasting his legal background with Grassley's lack of legal experience. The comments, released by a conservative PAC, sparked criticism, with Republican candidates and state leaders condemning the remarks. Braley apologized to Grassley and emphasized his family's farming roots, stating, "I deeply appreciate what farmers do for the world." Grassley, who owns a farm, often highlights his unique background on the Judiciary Committee. Braley, a former lawyer, is running to replace retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, in a race pivotal to Senate control. His comments drew negative attention, with a Republican candidate capitalizing on the backlash. Braley's apology acknowledged those "offended" and highlighted his appreciation for farmers.  
END OF SUMMARY.
