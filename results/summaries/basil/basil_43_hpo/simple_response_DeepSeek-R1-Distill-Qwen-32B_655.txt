Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Rep. Bruce Braley making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley. Braley, who's running for Senate, criticized Grassley's background at a fundraiser. He pointed out that Grassley is a farmer without a law degree, implying that's a negative. 

The moral framing here seems to be about respect and the appropriateness of attacking someone's background. Braley's comments were seen as disrespectful, especially since Grassley has a legitimate role on the Judiciary Committee despite not being a lawyer. 

I should highlight that Braley's remarks were criticized for being disrespectful and that he later apologized. Also, the fact that Grassley is a respected figure adds to the moral aspect of the situation. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Braley's criticism, then the backlash, his apology, and the context of Grassley's background. 

Let me structure it: Braley criticized Grassley's background, leading to backlash. He apologized, emphasizing his own rural roots. Grassley's role and Braley's legal background are important points. Also, the political implications for the Senate race should be included briefly.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.
