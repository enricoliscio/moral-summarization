SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, were made public. At a fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background as a lawyer with Grassley's, who is a farmer. Braley's comments were seen as offensive to farmers and sparked condemnation from state Republican leaders and Braley's potential Republican opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley and posted a statement expressing his appreciation for farmers, influenced by his own family's farming background. The race between Braley and Grassley is significant as it is one of a few that will determine control of the Senate. Braley's comments highlight the importance of considering the impact of one's words and the potential to cause offense. Offending others can have consequences, and it is important for those in positions of power to be mindful of their words and actions and to take responsibility when they cause harm.
END OF SUMMARY.
