SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a January fundraiser in Texas. Braley, who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that Grassley's lack of law school education and practice made him unqualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative political action committee, sparking negative attention from local media and Republican opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, emphasizing his appreciation for farmers and his own family's farming background. The controversy has put Braley's campaign under scrutiny, with the race being one of a handful that will determine control of the Senate.
