SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash for critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. At a fundraiser, Braley highlighted his legal background and contrasted it with Grassley's lack of a legal education, suggesting that having a lawyer represent Iowa on the Senate Judiciary Committee would be preferable to a "farmer from Iowa." Braley's comments were seen as offensive and sparked immediate condemnation. Braley, himself a lawyer, later apologized to Grassley and emphasized his own connection to farming through his parents. The incident underscores the importance of moral character in political representation and the potential consequences of insensitive remarks in a closely watched Senate race that could shift the balance of power in Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
