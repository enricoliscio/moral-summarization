SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa running for Senate, made controversial comments about his opponent, Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. Braley, a lawyer, contrasted his background with Grassley's, saying that he is a lawyer while Grassley is "a farmer who never went to law school." This sparked backlash and Braley apologized, recognizing the importance of farming in his own family background and in Iowa. The incident highlights the role of moral framing in politics, where Braley's comments were perceived as offensive and required an apology, and the power of opposition research by political action committees. It also underscores the importance of the race for control of the Senate, with Braley's campaign being one of a few that will determine the majority. The moral framing of this incident centers around respect for different professions, backgrounds, and the value of farming in Iowa, with Braley's comments seen as disrespectful and requiring an apology to rectify. END OF SUMMARY.
