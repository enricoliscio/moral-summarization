Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bruce Braley. Let me read through the article first.

So, Braley is running to replace Sen. Tom Harkin in Iowa. He made some critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a fundraiser in Texas. He contrasted his legal background with Grassley's, who's a farmer without a law degree. America Rising, a conservative group, released these comments. Now, there's backlash, and Braley has apologized.

I should include the key points: who Braley is, his comments about Grassley, the reaction from Grassley and others, Braley's apology, and the significance of the race for the Senate.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. Let me structure it step by step: introduce Braley, mention the fundraiser and his comments, the release by America Rising, the backlash, his apology, and the context of the Senate race.

I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Also, make sure to include that Grassley is a farmer and that Braley has a legal background. The apology part is important, as well as the fact that this race is significant for the Senate control.

Okay, let me draft the summary now, making sure it flows well and covers all the essential elements without being too lengthy.
