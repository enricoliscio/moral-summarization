Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bruce Braley. Let me read through it carefully.

So, Braley is running to replace Sen. Tom Harkin. He made some comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a fundraiser. He contrasted his legal background with Grassley, who's a farmer and not a lawyer. The PAC released these comments, leading to backlash. The article mentions that Braley apologized and emphasized his family's farming roots. Grassley is the only non-lawyer on the Judiciary Committee. Braley has a law background and is a key race for the Senate.

I should highlight the key points: Braley's criticism of Grassley, the backlash, his apology, Grassley's background, and the significance of the race. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
