Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I have to make sure I capture the moral elements correctly.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Rep. Bruce Braley making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley. Braley was at a fundraiser and compared his legal background to Grassley's, who is a farmer without a law degree. The article mentions that Braley's remarks were released by a conservative PAC, leading to backlash. Braley apologized, emphasizing his family's farming roots.

The user pointed out that the author used the words "help" and "offended." I need to include these in the summary. Also, I should keep the summary under 200 words and structure it after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by identifying the key points: Braley's criticism, the context of the fundraiser, the PAC's role, the backlash, and Braley's apology. I'll make sure to include "help" and "offended" as per the instructions.

I should also keep the language clear and concise, sticking to the facts while highlighting the moral aspects like the apology and the emphasis on family background. I need to ensure that the summary flows well and captures all necessary details without being too lengthy.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and stay within the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance. Once done, I'll review it to make sure it accurately reflects the article's content and the moral elements specified.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a January fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to support his campaign, contrasting his legal background with Grassley's lack of legal experience. He implied Grassley, a farmer, was unqualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The remarks, released by a conservative PAC, sparked criticism. Republican candidate Mark Jacobs capitalized on the controversy with a radio ad. Local media highlighted the backlash, and Braley apologized to Grassley in person and publicly, emphasizing his family's farming roots. "I apologize to Sen. Grassley and anyone I may have offended," Braley wrote, acknowledging his parents' farm upbringing. Grassley, a farmer and the only non-lawyer on the Judiciary Committee, often highlights his background. Braley, a former lawyer, has been in Congress since 2006. His race is key to Senate control.  
END OF SUMMARY.
