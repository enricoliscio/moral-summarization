SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), faced backlash after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a fundraiser in Texas, Braley highlighted their differences, contrasting his law background with Grassley's farmer background. Braley's remarks were released by a conservative PAC and sparked negative reactions, including a radio ad by a Republican primary candidate. The incident made the front pages of Iowa newspapers, and Braley apologized to Grassley in person and through a public statement, acknowledging the influence of his family's farming background. The race between Braley and Grassley is significant as it could impact the control of the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
