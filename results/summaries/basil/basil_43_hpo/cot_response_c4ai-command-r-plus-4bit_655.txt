SUMMARY:
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), faced backlash and condemnation from local media and political opponents after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a fundraiser, Braley contrasted his background as a lawyer with Grassley's, suggesting that having a lawyer represent Iowa in the Senate Judiciary Committee was preferable to "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school". Braley's remarks were seen as offensive to Grassley, a farmer and the only non-lawyer on the panel, and to farmers more generally. Braley issued an apology to Grassley and anyone else he may have offended, expressing his appreciation for farmers and the influence of his own family's farming background. The incident sparked criticism from state Republican leaders and Braley's potential Republican opponents, with one candidate quickly releasing a radio ad to capitalize on the controversy. Braley's apology was accompanied by a statement emphasizing his respect for farmers. The incident highlights the importance of moral values and the potential consequences of insensitive remarks in political campaigns. END OF SUMMARY.
