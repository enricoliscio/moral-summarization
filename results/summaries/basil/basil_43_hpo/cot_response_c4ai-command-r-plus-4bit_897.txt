SUMMARY:
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash and condemnation from local media and Republican opponents after his critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a fundraiser, Braley appealed to attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background as a lawyer with Grassley's identity as a farmer who never attended law school. Braley's remarks were perceived as offensive and sparked immediate criticism, with Braley offering both a public apology and a personal apology to Grassley. In his apology statement, Braley acknowledged the influence of his parents' farming background during the Great Depression and expressed his appreciation for farmers. The incident highlights the moral dimensions of the race for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Braley's race is among a handful that will decide which party controls the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
