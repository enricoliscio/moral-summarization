SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that a farmer without a law degree was unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative PAC, sparking negative attention and prompting Braley to apologize to Grassley in person. Braley also posted a statement apologizing to anyone he may have offended, highlighting his family's farming roots and appreciation for farmers' contributions. The apology came after state Republican Party leaders and potential general election opponents condemned his remarks. The incident has significant implications, as Braley's race is crucial in determining control of the Senate.
