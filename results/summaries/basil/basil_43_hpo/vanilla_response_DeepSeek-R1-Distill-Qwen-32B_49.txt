Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bruce Braley. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the article talks about how Braley, who's running to replace Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash after making some critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley. The comments were made at a fundraiser in January, and they were released by a conservative PAC called America Rising.

Braley compared his background to Grassley's, pointing out that Grassley is a farmer who didn't go to law school. He emphasized that his legal experience would make him a better fit for the Senate Judiciary Committee. This backfired because Grassley is known for being a farmer and the only non-lawyer on the committee.

The article mentions that Braley's comments were featured in major newspapers, and a Republican candidate, Mark Jacobs, used it in a radio ad. Braley then apologized to Grassley and acknowledged his own farming roots, trying to mend fences.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Braley's criticism of Grassley, the backlash, the PAC's role, the media coverage, the ad by Jacobs, and Braley's apology.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all important aspects without getting too detailed. Also, I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main events and outcomes.
