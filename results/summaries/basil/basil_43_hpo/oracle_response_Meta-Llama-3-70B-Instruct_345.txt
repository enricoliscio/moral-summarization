SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after his critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that a farmer without a law degree would be unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative political action committee, sparking widespread criticism. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, emphasizing his appreciation for farmers, as his parents grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression. Braley's apology acknowledged that his words may have offended others. The controversy has put Braley's Senate bid under scrutiny, with Republican opponents seizing the opportunity to capitalize on the negative attention.
