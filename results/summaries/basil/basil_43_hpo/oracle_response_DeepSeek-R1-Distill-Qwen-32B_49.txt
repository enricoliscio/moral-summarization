Alright, I need to summarize the news article provided while preserving the moral framing the author used. The key is to include the words "help" and "offended" as they were used in the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Bruce Braley made critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a fundraiser, comparing their backgrounds. This led to backlash, and Braley apologized. 

I should start by identifying the main events: Braley's comments, the reaction, the apology, and the context of their backgrounds. I need to make sure to use "help" and "offended" in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to mention Braley urging attorneys to help his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, and then the fallout. I'll include the apology and the emphasis on his farming roots to show he tried to make amends.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while retaining the moral elements. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral words are included.

SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after criticizing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a January fundraiser, urging attorneys to "help" his campaign by contrasting his legal background with Grassley's farming roots. Braley's remarks, released by a conservative PAC, sparked criticism, with Grassley's farm ownership and non-lawyer status highlighted. Republican candidate Mark Jacobs capitalized on the controversy with a radio ad. Local media covered the backlash, and Braley apologized to Grassley, stating he "offended" him and emphasizing his own farming heritage. Braley's race is pivotal in the Senate control battle.
