SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash for his critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), which were made public by a conservative political action committee. At a fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that Grassley's lack of law school education and practice made him unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley's remarks offended many, including state Republican Party leaders and his potential general election opponents. He apologized to Grassley in person and posted a statement, saying "I apologize to Sen. Grassley and anyone I may have offended." Braley emphasized his appreciation for farmers, citing his family's farming background. The controversy may harm Braley's chances in a crucial race that will help determine control of the Senate.
