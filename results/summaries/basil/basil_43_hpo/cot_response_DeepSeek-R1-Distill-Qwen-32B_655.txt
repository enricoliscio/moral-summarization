Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided specific steps: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, often used to influence the reader's judgment. For example, words like "criticized," "condemned," or "apologized" can indicate moral judgments.

Looking at the provided article, I should go through each sentence and pick out words that have a moral connotation. Let me read through the text again.

The article talks about Rep. Braley making critical comments about Sen. Grassley. Words like "criticized," "condemned," "apologized," "appreciation," "influence," "background," "experience," "voice," "opportunity," "capitalize," "backlash," "condemned," "apologized," "influence," "background," "experience," "voice," "opportunity," "capitalize," "backlash," "condemned," "apologized," "appreciation," "influence," "background," "experience," "voice," "opportunity," "capitalize," "backlash," "condemned," "apologized."

Wait, I might be repeating some. Let me list them without duplication.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the morally framed words. I should mention Braley's criticism, the backlash, his apology, Grassley's background, and the political implications.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too verbose. I'll start by stating Braley's criticism, then the backlash, his apology, and conclude with the significance of the race.

I should check if I'm using all the identified moral words appropriately without forcing them. The summary should read naturally while preserving the moral elements from the original text.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Braley's remarks, released by a conservative PAC, drew condemnation from Republican leaders and potential opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley, emphasizing his family's farming roots and appreciation for farmers.
