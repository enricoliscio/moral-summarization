SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a fundraiser, Braley contrasted his law background with Grassley's farming background, implying that Grassley was not qualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative PAC and sparked negative coverage from local newspapers. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, emphasizing his appreciation for farmers and noting that his parents grew up on Iowa farms. The apology came after state Republican leaders and potential GOP opponents condemned his remarks. The incident could impact Braley's bid to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, a key race that will help determine control of the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
