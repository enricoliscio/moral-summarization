Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

So, Rep. Bruce Braley made some critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a fundraiser. He pointed out that Grassley is a farmer who never went to law school and is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley was trying to contrast his legal background with Grassley's. The article mentions that this was released by a conservative PAC, America Rising, which did opposition research on Democrats. 

The backlash was immediate, with Mark Jacobs, a Republican candidate, using it in a radio ad. Local newspapers covered it, and Braley apologized, emphasizing his own farm roots. Grassley is a farmer and often mentions being the only non-lawyer on the committee. Braley has a law background and is running for the Senate seat.

The moral framing seems to be about respect and appropriateness in political discourse. Braley's comments were seen as disrespectful, especially targeting someone's background. The author might be highlighting the importance of decorum in politics, suggesting that attacking someone's background isn't fair, especially when that background is a point of pride for the person involved.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: Braley's criticism, the backlash, the apology, and the context of their backgrounds. Also, I should convey the moral aspect that attacking someone's background is inappropriate, which is the framing from the article.

Let me structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, keeping it under 200 words.
