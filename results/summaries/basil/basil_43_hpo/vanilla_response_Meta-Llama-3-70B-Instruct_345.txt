SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), running for Sen. Tom Harkin's (D-Iowa) seat, faced backlash after comments criticizing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a Texas fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to support him, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that a "farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" might lead the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative PAC, and Braley's potential Republican opponents condemned his remarks. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and posted a statement, emphasizing his family's farming roots and appreciation for farmers. The incident was featured on the front pages of the Des Moines Register and Quad-City Times. The race is crucial in determining control of the Senate.
