Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words "help" and "offended." Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Rep. Bruce Braley making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley during a fundraiser. Braley contrasted his legal background with Grassley's farming background, which was seen as offensive. The conservative PAC released these comments, leading to backlash. Braley apologized, emphasizing his family's farming roots.

I should include the key points: Braley's criticism, the context of the fundraiser, the release by America Rising, the backlash, and his apology. I need to make sure to use "help" and "offended" as per the author's framing.

Let me structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the incident, the reaction, and then the apology. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all necessary details.

I should also mention Grassley's background as a farmer and Braley's legal experience to provide context. The summary should reflect the moral aspects without adding my own judgment, just as the author presented them.

Double-checking to ensure I included "help" and "offended." Yes, Braley urged attorneys to help his campaign and later apologized for offending Grassley and others.

Okay, I think that's a solid summary that meets all the requirements.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a January fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to help his campaign and contrasted his legal background with Grassley's farming roots, implying Grassley's lack of legal experience made him unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The remarks, released by a conservative PAC, sparked criticism. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and issued a statement, expressing regret and emphasizing his family's farming heritage. "I apologize to Sen. Grassley and anyone I may have offended," Braley wrote, highlighting his deep appreciation for farmers. Grassley, a farmer himself, often notes his non-lawyer status on the Judiciary Committee. Braley, a former lawyer, is running to replace retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, with the race pivotal in determining Senate control.
