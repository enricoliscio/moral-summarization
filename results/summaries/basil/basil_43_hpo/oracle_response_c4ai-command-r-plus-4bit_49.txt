SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Iowa running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, found himself in hot water after comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, were made public. At a fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign by contrasting his background in law with Grassley's identity as a farmer. Braley's comments were criticized as offensive, and he apologized to Grassley and anyone else he may have offended. Braley's race is one of a few that will determine control of the Senate, and the backlash over his comments received prominent media coverage. One of Braley's potential Republican opponents quickly capitalized on the negative attention with a radio ad. Braley, who has farmers in his family, emphasized his appreciation for the contributions of farmers in his apology.
END OF SUMMARY.
