Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. They want me to focus on preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the context and the key points.

The article is about Rep. Bruce Braley facing backlash after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley. Braley was running for the Senate seat, and his remarks were released by a conservative group. He compared his legal background to Grassley's farming background, which upset Grassley and led to an apology.

Now, the user has two main tasks. First, identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to look for words that carry a moral judgment or implication. Words like "tough," "critical," "condemned," "apologized," "offended," and "appreciation" seem to carry moral weight here.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the key events: Braley's comments, the backlash, the apology, and the context of their backgrounds.

I should ensure that the summary flows naturally while preserving the moral elements. I'll start by stating the issue, then the reaction, the apology, and the background details that explain the moral framing.

Let me put this together step by step, making sure each part is clear and concise. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure all important points are covered.

* Apologized  
* Offended  
* Appreciation  

**SUMMARY:**  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced tough backlash after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) during a January fundraiser. Braley contrasted his legal background with Grassley's farming background, suggesting Grassley, a non-lawyer, was unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The remarks, released by a conservative PAC, sparked condemnation from state Republicans and potential opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and issued a public statement, acknowledging his family's farming roots and expressing appreciation for farmers. Grassley, a farmer himself, often highlights his unique background on the Judiciary Committee. Braley, a lawyer, has been in Congress since 2006. His race is pivotal in determining Senate control.
