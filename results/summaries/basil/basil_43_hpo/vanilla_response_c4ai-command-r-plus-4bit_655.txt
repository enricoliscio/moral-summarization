SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash after critical comments he made about Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley were made public. At a January fundraiser, Braley contrasted his background as a lawyer with Grassley's, saying that Iowa might have "a farmer who never went to law school" serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley's comments were released by a conservative PAC and sparked negative coverage in local media. Braley apologized to Grassley and emphasized his own appreciation for farmers, given his family's background. The race between Braley and potential Republican opponents is expected to be competitive and could determine control of the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
