SUMMARY: Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) is in hot water after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley, who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign by contrasting his background in law with Grassley's identity as a farmer. America Rising, a conservative PAC, released Braley's remarks, causing a backlash from local media and Republican leaders. Braley apologized to Grassley and posted a statement expressing his appreciation for farmers. The race between Braley and one of his leading Republican opponents, Mark Jacobs, is significant in determining control of the Senate. Braley's comments highlight a contrast between two visions for the Senate Judiciary Committee: one represented by a lawyer and the other by a non-lawyer farmer.

END OF SUMMARY.
