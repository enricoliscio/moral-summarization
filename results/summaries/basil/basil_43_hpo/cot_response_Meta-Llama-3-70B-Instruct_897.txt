SUMMARY:
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced tough local coverage after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that a farmer without a law degree would be unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The remarks were released by a conservative political action committee, sparking negative attention and condemnation from state Republican Party leaders and potential opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, emphasizing his profound appreciation for farmers, as his parents grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression. The incident has significant implications, as the race will help determine control of the Senate. Braley's apology was seen as an attempt to mitigate the backlash, but the damage may have already been done. END OF SUMMARY.
