SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is facing backlash for comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, in which he appeared to disparage farmers who don't have a legal education. Braley, who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, made the comments at a fundraiser in Texas in January. In contrast to his own background as a lawyer, he referred to Grassley as "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." The remarks were made public by a conservative political action committee and sparked immediate criticism, with Braley's Republican opponents seizing on the comments. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and posted a statement expressing his profound appreciation for farmers. However, the damage was done, and the incident raises questions about the morality of Braley's attitude towards those without a legal education, as well as the potential impact on his Senate campaign in a state with strong agricultural roots. END OF SUMMARY.
