SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash for comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. At a fundraiser in Texas, Braley contrasted his background as a lawyer with Grassley's, saying that the choice was between "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school" and someone with a legal background. Braley's comments were released by a conservative PAC and sparked criticism, including from state Republican leaders and potential GOP opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a public statement, acknowledging his family's farming background. The incident highlighted the importance of Braley's race in the battle for control of the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
