SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley, a farmer and the only non-lawyer on the Senate Judiciary Committee, were made public. Braley, a lawyer, had urged attorneys at a fundraiser to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his legal background with Grassley's lack thereof. The comments were released by a conservative PAC and sparked immediate criticism, including a radio ad by Republican candidate Mark Jacobs. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a public statement, acknowledging his family's farming background and expressing appreciation for farmers. The incident highlighted the importance of Braley's race in the battle for control of the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
