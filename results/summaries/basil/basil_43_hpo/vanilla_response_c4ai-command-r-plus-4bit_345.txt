SUMMARY: Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash for comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a January fundraiser. Braley contrasted his background as a lawyer with Grassley's, saying that Iowa might have "a farmer who never went to law school" serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative PAC and sparked criticism from state Republican leaders and Braley's potential GOP opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley and emphasized his own appreciation for farmers, given his family's background. The race between Braley and his Republican opponents is seen as crucial in determining control of the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
