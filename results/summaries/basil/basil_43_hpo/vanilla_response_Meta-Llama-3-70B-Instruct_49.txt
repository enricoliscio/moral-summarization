SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, faced backlash after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a January fundraiser in Texas. Braley contrasted his law background with Grassley's farming background, implying that Grassley was not qualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative political action committee, prompting a radio ad from a Republican primary candidate and front-page coverage in local newspapers. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, emphasizing his appreciation for farmers and noting that his parents grew up on Iowa farms. The incident could impact Braley's campaign, which is one of a handful that will determine control of the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
