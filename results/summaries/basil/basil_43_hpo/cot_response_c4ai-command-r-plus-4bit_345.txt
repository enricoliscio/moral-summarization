SUMMARY: 
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), a candidate for the U.S. Senate, faced backlash and condemnation from local media and political opponents for critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). At a fundraiser, Braley highlighted his legal background and contrasted it with Grassley's, suggesting that a "farmer from Iowa" who lacked a legal education and practice was unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley's comments were seen as offensive, and he swiftly offered an apology to Grassley and anyone else he may have offended. He acknowledged his deep appreciation for farmers and the influence of his own family's farming background. The incident sparked moral outrage, with state Republican leaders and potential GOP opponents criticizing Braley's remarks. Braley's apology and emphasis on his family's farming history aimed to rectify his mistake and demonstrate his respect for the farming community. The race between Braley and his Republican opponents is a crucial contest that will impact the control of the Senate.
