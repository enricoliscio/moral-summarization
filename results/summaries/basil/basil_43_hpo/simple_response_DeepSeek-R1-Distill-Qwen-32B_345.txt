Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let's see. The article is about Rep. Bruce Braley making some critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley, which backfired and caused some backlash. 

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points. Braley was at a fundraiser in Texas and told attorneys that if they supported him, he could bring their background to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He contrasted that with Grassley, a farmer who never went to law school, implying that Grassley isn't as qualified. 

Then, a conservative group released these comments, leading to negative coverage. Mark Jacobs, a Republican candidate, used this to his advantage with a radio ad. Local papers also covered the backlash. Braley apologized, emphasizing his family's farming background, but Grassley is known for being the only non-lawyer on the committee.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be about respect and appropriateness in political discourse. Braley's comments were seen as disrespectful, targeting Grassley's background. The author probably wants to highlight that attacking someone's qualifications, especially their background, is not acceptable. 

So, in the summary, I need to include that Braley criticized Grassley's background, the backlash that followed, the apology, and the context of Grassley's role. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspect is clearâ€”criticizing someone's background is frowned upon.

I should structure it by starting with Braley's comments, the reaction, the apology, and the context. Make sure to mention the conservative group and the radio ad to show the impact of his words. Also, include that Braley's family has a farming background to show his attempt to mend fences.

Let me draft that. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Also, end with the tokens as specified.
