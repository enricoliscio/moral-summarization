SUMMARY:
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced tough local coverage after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. Braley's remarks, which were released by a conservative political action committee, were seen as condescending towards Grassley's background as a farmer. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and posted a statement, expressing a profound appreciation for the work of farmers, which he said was influenced by his parents' upbringing on Iowa farms during the Great Depression. State Republican Party leaders and potential Republican general election opponents condemned Braley's remarks, calling them offensive. Braley's apology was seen as an attempt to mitigate the backlash, which was featured on the front pages of local newspapers. The incident has sparked a heated debate in a crucial Senate race that will determine control of the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
