Braley apologized to Grassley and emphasized his own appreciation for farmers, given his family's background. The race between Braley and Grassley is significant as it is one of a few that will determine control of the Senate. Braley's comments highlight a moral dilemma between valuing diverse backgrounds and expertise in governance.
