SUMMARY:

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that Grassley's lack of law school education made him less qualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative political action committee, sparking widespread condemnation from state Republican Party leaders and potential opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, expressing regret for any offense caused and highlighting his family's farming roots. The apology was seen as an attempt to mitigate the negative attention, which could impact his bid to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). The incident has significant implications, as the race is crucial in determining control of the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
