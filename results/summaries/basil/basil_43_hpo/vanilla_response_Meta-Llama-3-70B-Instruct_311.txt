SUMMARY:

Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, running for Iowa's open Senate seat, faced backlash after criticizing Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley's lack of legal background. At a Texas fundraiser, Braley urged attorneys to support him, implying that Grassley, a farmer, was unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments were released by a conservative PAC, sparking widespread criticism. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, highlighting his own family's farming roots. The incident dominated local front pages, with Republican opponents seizing on the controversy. A radio ad was released by businessman Mark Jacobs, a leading GOP primary candidate, capitalizing on the negative attention. The race is crucial in determining Senate control.
