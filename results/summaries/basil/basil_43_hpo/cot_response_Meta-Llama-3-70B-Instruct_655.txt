SUMMARY:
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced tough local coverage after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. Braley's remarks, which were released by a conservative political action committee, were deemed offensive and sparked backlash from state Republican Party leaders and his potential general election opponents. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and posted a statement, expressing a profound appreciation for farmers and acknowledging that his parents grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression. The representative's comments were seen as a condemnation of Grassley's background as a farmer, implying that it made him unqualified to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley's apology and emphasis on his family's farming roots were likely an attempt to mitigate the negative attention. END OF SUMMARY.
