Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Rep. Bruce Braley making some critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley, and the subsequent backlash. 

First, I need to understand the key points. Braley criticized Grassley for not being a lawyer, which backfired. He faced criticism from Republicans and apologized. The article also mentions Grassley's background as a farmer and non-lawyer, which is relevant.

I should focus on the moral aspects here. Braley's comments were seen as disrespectful, especially since Grassley has a long-standing reputation in the Senate. The apology was an attempt to mend fences, emphasizing his own farming roots.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main events: the fundraiser comments, the backlash, the apology, and the context of their backgrounds. Also, the political implications, like the Senate race, should be mentioned briefly.

I'll structure the summary by starting with Braley's comments, the reaction, the apology, and then the broader context. I should avoid adding my own opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral framing from the article.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with Braley's remarks, then the backlash, then his apology, and finally the significance of the race. Make sure it's all within the word limit and flows naturally.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after remarks at a January fundraiser criticizing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) for lacking a legal background. Braley, running to replace Sen. Tom Harkin, contrasted his legal experience with Grassley's farming background, saying Grassley, a non-lawyer, would chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments, released by a conservative PAC, sparked criticism from Republicans, including businessman Mark Jacobs, who used the remarks in a radio ad. Iowa media outlets highlighted the backlash, and Braley apologized to Grassley in person and in a statement, acknowledging his family's farming roots. Grassley, a farmer and the only non-lawyer on the Judiciary Committee, has long emphasized his background. Braley, a former lawyer, has faced political heat in a key Senate race.  
END OF SUMMARY.
