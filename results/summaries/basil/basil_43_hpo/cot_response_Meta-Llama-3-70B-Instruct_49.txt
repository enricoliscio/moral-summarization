SUMMARY:
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced tough local coverage after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at a fundraiser in Texas. Braley urged attorneys to contribute to his campaign, contrasting his background with Grassley's, implying that a farmer without a law degree would be unfit to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee. The comments sparked negative attention, with state Republican Party leaders and Braley's potential opponents condemning his remarks. Braley apologized to Grassley in person and posted a statement, expressing profound appreciation for farmers and acknowledging that his parents grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression. The backlash against Braley's comments was featured on the front pages of the Des Moines Register and the Quad-City Times. END OF SUMMARY.
