Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The author used words like "help" and "offended," so I should include those. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

Rep. Bruce Braley made critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley at a fundraiser, pointing out Grassley's lack of legal background. America Rising released these comments, leading to backlash. Braley apologized, emphasizing his farm roots. The article also mentions the political implications, like the race's importance for the Senate.

I should start by stating Braley's comments and their release. Then, mention the backlash and his apology, using "help" and "offended." I'll also include the context about Grassley's background and Braley's legal experience. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the required tokens.

Let me draft that. Make sure to include the moral words and the key events. Check the word count to stay within limits. Alright, that should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) faced backlash after remarks at a January fundraiser criticizing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a farmer and non-lawyer, for his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Braley urged attorneys to "help" him win the race, contrasting his legal background with Grassley's lack of legal experience. The comments, released by conservative group America Rising, sparked criticism, with Republican candidate Mark Jacobs capitalizing on the controversy. Local media highlighted the backlash, and Braley apologized to Grassley, acknowledging his own farm roots and expressing regret for offending anyone. Grassley, a farmer and the only non-lawyer on the Judiciary Committee, has often highlighted his background. Braley, a former lawyer, emphasized his appreciation for farmers, but his remarks have drawn attention in a key Senate race.  
END OF SUMMARY.
