Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Bruce Braley. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how Braley, who's running to replace Sen. Tom Harkin, faced tough local coverage after making critical comments about Sen. Chuck Grassley. He made these comments at a fundraiser in January, comparing his background to Grassley's. Braley emphasized his legal background, pointing out that Grassley is a farmer without a law degree.

America Rising, a conservative PAC, released these remarks. Then, a Republican candidate, Mark Jacobs, used this to his advantage with a radio ad. The local newspapers covered the backlash, and Braley apologized in person and on his website, mentioning his family's farming roots.

Grassley, who's a farmer, often mentions being the only non-lawyer on the Judiciary Committee. Braley has a law background and has been in the House since 2006. This race is important for Senate control.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Braley's comments, the reaction, the PAC's role, Jacobs' ad, the media coverage, Braley's apology, Grassley's background, and the significance of the race.

Let me make sure I include all key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the incident, the repercussions, the apologies, and the context of the race.
