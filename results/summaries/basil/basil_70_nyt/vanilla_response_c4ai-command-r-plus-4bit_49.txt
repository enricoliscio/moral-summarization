SUMMARY: Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, presenting himself as a populist leader who would reverse the country's decline. In his Inaugural Address, he outlined a grim vision of an America afflicted by economic and social issues, promising to restore its greatness. Mr. Trump's ascension marked a disruption to the established political order, with him positioning himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. He vowed to fight for the people and promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Mr. Trump's view of the country was strikingly dark, referring to "American carnage" and pledging to eradicate Islamic terrorism. He also highlighted his intention to shift power from Washington back to the people. The inauguration ceremony was attended by hundreds of thousands of supporters, but protests and boycotts also took place. Mr. Trump's speech was followed by a lobster-and-beef luncheon with congressional leaders, where he praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton. The new president's rise to power was unprecedented, as he had no prior political career and overcame skepticism to lead a working-class movement. Mr. Trump's inauguration marked a new era in American politics, with him promising to put the people first and take action to address the country's issues.
