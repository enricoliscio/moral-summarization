SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his inaugural address, Trump presented a dark vision of America, afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, and promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He took a hostile tone towards politicians, saying they are all talk and no action. Trump also signed orders to roll back Obama's policies, including freezing new regulations and easing the burden of the Affordable Care Act. Despite the rain, hundreds of thousands of people attended the inauguration, with some protests and arrests. Democrats were unimpressed, with one senator calling the speech "dark" and saying it didn't reflect the country's strengths. Trump's presidency marks a significant disruption to the capital, with many residents leaving town and Democrats boycotting the event.

END OF SUMMARY.
