SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, presenting himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore America's greatness. In his inaugural address, Trump outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by economic and foreign exploitation and pledged to fight for the American people. He promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension marked a significant disruption in Washington, with the new president vowing to shatter the established order. He took a grim view of the country, highlighting poverty, rusted factories, and the ravages of drug and crime. Trump also rolled back policies of his predecessor, Barack Obama, and issued orders to freeze new regulations and ease the burden of the Affordable Care Act. The inauguration ceremony was attended by hundreds of thousands of rain-soaked admirers and onlookers, with Trump being sworn in at noon. Protests and sporadic violence broke out throughout the day, with more than 200 people arrested. Trump's speech was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address, but he followed tradition by attending a church service and meeting with the Obamas before the ceremony. He became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adams. Trump's speech outlined a protectionist agenda and a pledge to eradicate Islamic terrorism. He vowed to give power back to the people and promised that change starts now.
