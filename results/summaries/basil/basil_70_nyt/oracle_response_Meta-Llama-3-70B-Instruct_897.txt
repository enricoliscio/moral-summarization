SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to "restore" lost greatness and "bring back" jobs, borders, and wealth. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of an America afflicted by "the ravages" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his "can-do approach" to turn around. He promised to "fight" for the people and "never let them down." Trump's ascension was seen as a "hostile takeover" of the capital, disrupting the established order. He took on leaders of both parties, presenting himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. Trump's view of the US was strikingly grim, describing a country where "mothers and children are trapped in poverty" and "drugs and crime have stolen too many lives." He declared that "this American carnage stops right here and stops right now." Throughout the day, there were peaceful protests and sporadic violence, with over 200 people arrested. Trump's presidency began with a sense of "disruption" and a promise to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism.
