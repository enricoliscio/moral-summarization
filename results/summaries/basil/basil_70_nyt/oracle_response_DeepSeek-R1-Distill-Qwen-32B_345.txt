SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, vowing to restore America's greatness and reverse its decline, which he described as "this American carnage." His address painted a grim picture of economic dislocation, poverty, and foreign exploitation, promising action to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump criticized politicians for inaction and emphasized a protectionist agenda, urging "buy American and hire American." He also pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism and reject prejudice. The inauguration marked a disruptive shift, with protests and violence, including smashed windows and a burned limousine, leading to arrests. Trump's rhetoric, while optimistic, struck a dark tone, contrasting with the divided nation's reactions. The day also saw the departure of President Obama, who left Washington for vacation, hinting at continued activism. Trump's unconventional path to power and his outsider identity dominated the narrative, as he sought to transfer power from Washington back to the people. END OF SUMMARY.
