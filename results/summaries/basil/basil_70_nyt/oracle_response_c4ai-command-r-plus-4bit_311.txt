SUMMARY: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, presenting himself as a populist leader who would restore the country's lost greatness. In his Inaugural Address, he painted a grim picture of an America afflicted by poverty, economic dislocation, and foreign exploitation, pledging to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension marked a hostile takeover of Washington, with him positioning himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system and promising to take action against empty talk. He vowed to fight for the American people and reverse the national decline he termed "American carnage." Trump's view of the United States was strikingly dark, highlighting inner-city poverty, rusted factories, and the ravages of drugs and crime. He promised to buy and hire American, eradicate Islamic terrorism, and disrupt the status quo where a small group reaped the rewards while the people bore the costs. Trump's inauguration marked a break from tradition, with him being the oldest and wealthiest president sworn in for the first time, and the first foreign-born first lady since Louisa Adams. The day was marked by peaceful protests, sporadic violence, and arrests, reflecting the lingering animosity from the campaign and the polarizing nature of the election. Trump's speech was unconventionally Republican, with a protectionist agenda and no mention of tax cuts or government restraint. He assumed the presidency with less support in polls than any other recent president, inheriting a country still unsettled by the election and facing questions about his business interests and Russian interference.
END OF SUMMARY.
