SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse national decline. In his dark and strikingly grim inaugural address, he presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a vision of an America afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around. Trump's ascension marks a hostile takeover of a capital facing significant disruption, with him taking on leaders of both parties and presenting himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. He promised to "fight for you with every breath in my body" and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. The inauguration was met with protests, with over 200 people arrested, and Democrats were unimpressed by Trump's address, calling it "dark" and "grim".

END OF SUMMARY.
