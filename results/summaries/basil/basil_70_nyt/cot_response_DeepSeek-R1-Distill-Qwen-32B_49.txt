Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task is to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about Trump's inauguration, his speech, the events, and reactions. The user provided specific instructions: first, identify all single words that are morally framed. Then, write a summary using those words.

I'll start with Step 1. I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "disruption," "hostile takeover," "outsider," "empty talk," "dark vision," "carnage," "failure," "protest," "boycott," "disenchanted," "truth-telling," "untraditional," "wealth," "cost," "prejudice," "eradicate," "flourished," "shared," "change." These words reflect the moral judgments in the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping those moral terms. I should highlight Trump's inauguration, his rhetoric about American carnage, the hostile takeover, his outsider status, and the reactions. I'll mention the protests, the divided support, and the moral framing around truth-telling and change.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes the key points without going over the word limit. I'll structure it to cover Trump's vision, the political disruption, the protests, and the moral implications of his policies and rhetoric.

Finally, I'll make sure to end the summary correctly with the specified tokens. I think that's a solid plan to meet the user's requirements.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, presenting himself as an outsider who would disrupt the political establishment and reverse what he called "this American carnage." His inaugural address painted a grim picture of a nation plagued by economic decline, crime, and foreign exploitation, vowing to "make America great again" through a protectionist agenda. Trump's rhetoric, which included vows to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism and "buy American and hire American," was met with both support and protest. While his supporters celebrated, others expressed concern over his vision of a divided America. The inauguration marked a polarizing moment, with protests and boycotts reflecting the deep divisions in the country. Trump's untraditional approach, blending brash candor with a promise to end "empty talk," set the stage for a presidency that would challenge the status quo. His message of transferring power back to the people resonated with some, while others criticized his dark vision and the potential cost of his policies. END OF SUMMARY.
