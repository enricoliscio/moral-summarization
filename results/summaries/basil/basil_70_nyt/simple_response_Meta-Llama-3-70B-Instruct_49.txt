SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his dark and grim inaugural address, he painted a picture of a nation afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and poverty. He promised to fight for the American people and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension to power was seen as a hostile takeover of the capital, with him taking on leaders of both parties and presenting himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. Despite his divisive rhetoric, Trump made some efforts to reach out to Democrats, thanking Obama and Clinton for their handling of the transition. However, his address was met with skepticism by many, who saw it as a negative and divisive vision for the country. The inauguration was marked by protests and sporadic violence, with over 200 people arrested. Trump's presidency is seen as a significant disruption to the status quo, with many uncertain about what the future holds.
