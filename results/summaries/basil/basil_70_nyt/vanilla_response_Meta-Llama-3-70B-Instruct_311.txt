SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to restore American greatness and shatter the established order. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of America afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension marks a hostile takeover of the capital, with him positioning himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. He has begun rolling back Obama-era policies, issuing orders to freeze new regulations and ease the burden of the Affordable Care Act. Despite a polarizing election, Trump assumed office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. Protests against him were mostly peaceful, with some violence and arrests. Democrats were unimpressed by his address, calling it "dark" and criticizing his vision of America.

END OF SUMMARY.
