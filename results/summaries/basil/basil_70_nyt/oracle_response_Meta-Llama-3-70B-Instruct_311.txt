SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to "restore" lost greatness and "bring" back jobs, borders, and wealth. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of America afflicted by "the ravages" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his "can-do approach" to turn around. He promised to "fight" for the people and "never, ever let them down." Trump's ascension was a "hostile takeover" of a capital facing significant "disruption." He took on politicians of both parties, presenting himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. Trump's view of the US was grim, with "poverty" and "crime" having "stolen" too many lives, and he vowed to stop "this American carnage" immediately. Protests against him were mostly peaceful, but some turned violent, with "smashed" windows and "burned" cars. Trump made passing efforts to reach out to Democrats, but they were not impressed.
