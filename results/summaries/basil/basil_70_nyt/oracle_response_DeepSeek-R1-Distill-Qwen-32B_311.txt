Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. The user wants a concise summary of around 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Donald Trump's inauguration, his vision, the disruptions, and reactions. The author uses specific morally charged words like "restore," "ravages," "disruption," etc.

I should start by identifying the key events: Trump's inauguration, his address, the disruption in Washington, the protests, and the moral framing words used. I need to include these words naturally in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to cover Trump's populist message, the country's challenges, the immediate actions post-inauguration, the protests, and the moral implications. I'll ensure that each moral word is contextually appropriate.

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, highlighting the contrast between Trump's vision and the reactions, including the protests and the divided support. I'll also mention the peaceful protests and the arrests to show the disruptions.

Finally, I'll check that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and that it captures the moral framing effectively without losing the essence of the article.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, vowing to "restore" America's greatness and reverse its decline, which he described as "this American carnage." His inaugural address painted a grim picture of a nation afflicted by economic dislocation, poverty, and foreign exploitation, calling for decisive "action" to address these issues. Trump criticized political inaction and promised to "bring" back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. His ascension marked a "disruption" in Washington, with many seeing him as an outsider unbound by the current system. Protests, including "violence" and arrests, highlighted the nation's polarization. Trump's vision emphasized "buy American and hire American," while also pledging to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism. Despite his promises, many questioned his dark portrayal of the country and his commitment to "truth," "justice," and unity. His inauguration marked a shift in power, with Trump vowing to "change" the status quo and return control to the people. END OF SUMMARY.
