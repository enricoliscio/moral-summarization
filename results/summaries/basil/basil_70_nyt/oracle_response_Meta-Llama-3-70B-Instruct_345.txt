SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to "shatter the established order" and "restore lost greatness." In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of America, afflicted by "the ravages" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, and vowed to "bring back" jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He framed himself as the leader of a populist uprising, determined to "fight for" the people and "never let them down." Trump's ascension marked a "hostile takeover" of the capital, disrupting the status quo and rejecting the "empty talk" of politicians. He promised "action" to address "poverty," "crime," and "terrorism," and to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism. However, his speech was met with criticism from Democrats, who saw it as too dark and divisive. Protests and violence broke out, with over 200 people arrested. Despite the tumult, Trump remained resolute, promising to "bring change" and "give power back to the people." END OF SUMMARY.
