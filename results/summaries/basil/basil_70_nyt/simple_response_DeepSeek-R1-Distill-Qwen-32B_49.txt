Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's inauguration while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to get a sense of the main points and the tone.

The article starts by describing Trump's inauguration as a significant shift, using strong language like "hostile takeover" and "populist uprising." It mentions his dark vision of America's state, which is pretty grim—poverty, crime, factories in disrepair. Trump presents himself as the outsider who will fix these issues, contrasting with the establishment. He talks about bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and American greatness. The author also notes the protests and the divided crowd, showing the polarization. Trump's actions, like rolling back Obama's policies, are highlighted, as well as the lack of support he had compared to previous presidents. The article ends by reflecting on the unconventional nature of Trump's presidency and the legacy he's taking on.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing—Trump as a disruptor, the country's struggles, his outsider status, and the divisions. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the inauguration as a shift, Trump's dark vision, his outsider image, the protests, the policy rollbacks, and the overall divided reception.

Let me structure it: start with the inauguration as a new era, Trump's dark view of America, his promises, the hostile takeover, the divided crowd, the policy actions, and the mixed reactions. I'll make sure to include the moral aspects like the contrast between Trump's outsider status and the establishment, the polarization, and the criticism from Democrats.

I think I've got the main points. Now, I'll condense them into a concise summary, ensuring it's within 200 words and maintains the original's moral perspective.
