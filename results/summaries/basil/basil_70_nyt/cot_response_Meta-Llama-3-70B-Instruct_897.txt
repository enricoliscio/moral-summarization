SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse a national decline he called "this American carnage." In his dark and grim inaugural address, he presented a vision of an America afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around. He promised to "fight for you with every breath in my body" and bring back lost greatness, jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension was a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations, with a strikingly grim view of the United States. He vowed to take action, saying "the time for empty talk is over" and "now arrives the hour of action." END OF SUMMARY.
