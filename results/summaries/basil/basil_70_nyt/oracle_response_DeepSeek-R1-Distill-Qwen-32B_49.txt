Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump's inauguration, his populist message, the state of the nation, his policies, and the reactions. The morally charged words are key here, so I need to identify where they fit naturally.

I notice the article uses words like "restore," "ravages," "bring," "disruption," etc. I should make sure these are included without forcing them. The summary should reflect Trump's vows to change the country, the inauguration events, and the contrasting reactions.

I'll start by mentioning the inauguration and his goal to restore greatness. Then, touch on the dark vision of America he presented, using "ravages" and "carnage." Highlight his promises to bring back jobs and borders. Include the policy rollbacks and the protests, using "smashed," "burned," and "arrested."

Also, mention the moral words like "truth," "justice," "love," and "interference." Note the contrasting reactions from supporters and opponents, including the "Not my president" chants. Conclude with the traditional elements despite the disruption.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points and as many moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. Make sure the flow is logical, moving from the inauguration to his speech, policies, protests, and reactions.

Finally, check the word count and ensure all specified words are included. Make sure the summary is clear and captures the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, vowing to restore American greatness and reverse national decline. He painted a grim picture of a country afflicted by economic dislocation, poverty, and crime, calling it "this American carnage." Trump promised to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams, emphasizing action over empty talk. His inauguration marked a disruptive shift in Washington, with policies targeting rollbacks of Obama-era measures. Protests, including smashed windows and burned vehicles, led to arrests, while supporters chanted "Make America Great Again." Trump's speech focused on "buy American and hire American," aiming to eradicate terrorism and promote truth, justice, and love. Despite polarizing rhetoric, he acknowledged the Obamas and Clintons, though Democrats criticized his dark vision. The event highlighted a divided nation, with traditional elements like the Bibles used during the oath, yet marked by unprecedented disruption. END OF SUMMARY.
