Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The article is quite detailed, so I need to extract the key points without getting bogged down in every detail. Let me start by skimming the article to identify the main events and themes.

First, Trump's inauguration marked a significant shift in American politics. He presented himself as a populist leader aiming to restore the country's greatness, which was a central theme of his campaign. The article mentions his dark vision of America, highlighting issues like economic decline and foreign exploitation. I should note that in the summary.

He made several promises in his inaugural address, like bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. These are important points to include as they outline his administration's priorities. Also, his approach was to challenge the existing political system, which is a departure from traditional politics.

The article also touches on the political climate, mentioning the polarizing election and the protests that occurred. It's important to mention the protests and the arrests to show the public reaction to his inauguration. Additionally, the comparison to Obama's inauguration in terms of crowd size and enthusiasm is a key point about the public sentiment.

Another important aspect is Trump's background. He's the first president without prior political or military experience, which sets him apart from his predecessors. His wealth and business connections are also noted, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

The summary should also mention the immediate actions he took, like rolling back Obama's policies, which shows his intent to make changes quickly. His administration's focus on a protectionist agenda and addressing Islamic terrorism are part of his policy direction.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points: the inauguration as a political shift, Trump's populist message, his promises, the political climate, his background, and initial actions. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the inauguration, moving to his speech and promises, then the political context, and ending with his background and initial steps.

Let me make sure I include the key elements without going into too much detail. I should avoid specific names of people unless they are central to the points, like mentioning the protests but not the specific individuals involved. Also, highlighting the contrast between the inauguration and Obama's shows the change in public sentiment.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll craft the summary, ensuring it's clear and concise, fitting all these elements into a coherent paragraph under 200 words.
