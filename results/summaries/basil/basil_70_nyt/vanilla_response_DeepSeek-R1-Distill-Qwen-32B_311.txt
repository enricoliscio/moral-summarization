Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, using specific tokens. I'll start by identifying the main points.

The article talks about Trump becoming the 45th president, his inauguration speech, and the events surrounding it. He presents a dark view of America, promising change. He criticizes the political establishment and emphasizes action over talk. He rolled back Obama's policies immediately. The inauguration was marked by protests and smaller crowds compared to Obama's. Trump's background is unusual, and his speech focused on American carnage and bringing back jobs, borders, and wealth. He also mentioned fighting Islamic terrorism and using a protectionist approach. The event was traditional yet unconventional, with some Democrats boycotting.

I need to condense all this into a clear, concise summary. I'll focus on Trump's inauguration, his speech's tone, key promises, initial actions, the atmosphere of the event, and the political backdrop. I'll make sure to mention the protests, the comparison to Obama's inauguration, and Trump's unconventional background.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's inauguration, his message in the speech, his promises, initial actions, the atmosphere (protests, smaller crowds), and the political divide. Keep each point brief to stay under 200 words.

I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Make sure to include that it's the 58th inauguration, the mention of the Bibles, and the protectionist agenda. Also, note the shift in power and the political opposition.

I think that covers the main elements. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and hits all key points without being too detailed.

The inauguration, held amid protests and smaller crowds than Obama's 2009 event, highlighted political polarization. Trump, an outsider with no prior political experience, positioned himself as a disruptor, focusing on protectionism and fighting terrorism. The event was marked by traditional elements, including a Bible used by Lincoln and Obama, yet reflected his unconventional leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
