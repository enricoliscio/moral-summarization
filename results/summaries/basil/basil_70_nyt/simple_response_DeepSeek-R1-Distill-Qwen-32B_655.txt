Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th president. It describes his vision for the country, his promises, and the reactions from different groups. The tone seems to highlight the stark contrast between Trump's message and the established political order, as well as the polarized reactions from supporters and opponents.

I should focus on the main events: Trump's inauguration, his speech emphasizing a dark vision of America, his promises to bring back jobs and borders, his criticism of the political establishment, and the immediate actions he took like rolling back Obama's policies. Also, the protests and the divided reactions from Democrats and supporters are important.

I need to make sure to include the moral framing, which includes the sense of a hostile takeover, the stark vision of a failing America, and the division in the country. The summary should capture the tension and the significant shift in leadership.

I'll start by outlining the key points: inauguration details, Trump's dark vision, his promises, criticism of politicians, immediate policy actions, the protests, divided reactions, and the historical context of Trump's background.

Now, I'll condense these points into a coherent summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll make sure to maintain the moral elements, such as the "American carnage" and the polarized nation.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all essential elements without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, presenting himself as a populist leader aiming to reverse national decline and "American carnage." His inaugural address painted a grim picture of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, vowing to restore greatness through a "buy American, hire American" agenda. Trump criticized the political establishment, promising action over empty talk, and immediately rolled back Obama-era policies. The event highlighted a polarized nation, with supporters celebrating and opponents protesting, including a women’s march planned for the next day. Trump’s ascension marked a stark departure from traditional politics, with his outsider status and brash rhetoric resonating with some while alarming others. His inauguration was met with both admiration and resistance, underscoring a divided America. END OF SUMMARY.
