Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's inauguration while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I need to include as much as possible. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and identify where those moral words are used.

The article talks about Trump's inauguration, his vision to "restore" America, the "ravages" of economic issues, bringing back jobs and borders. There's mention of "disruption" in the capital, not accepting politicians who don't act, the need for "action." He addresses poverty and drugs, using "stolen" lives. He calls the current state "carnage," which is pretty strong. There's also violence during protests, "smashed" windows, "burned" cars, police using tear gas, and people arrested. He mentions truth, justice, humor, and love, and the "interference" from Russia. His policies include "buy American" and "hire American," and he wants to "eradicate" terrorism. He talks about how Washington has "reaped" rewards while people didn't share in the wealth, and he's bringing "changes."

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start by mentioning the inauguration and his vision to restore America, using "restore." Then talk about the "ravages" and bringing back jobs, borders, etc. Mention the disruption in Washington, not accepting inaction, and the call for action. Then touch on the dark vision of poverty, stolen lives, and carnage. Include the protests with violence, smashed windows, burned cars, arrests. Highlight his mention of truth, justice, love, and the interference issue. Finally, his policies on buying and hiring American, eradicating terrorism, and the changes he's bringing.

I need to make sure I include as many of the moral words as possible without making the summary too long. Also, keep the tone consistent with the original article's framing, which seems to present Trump's actions and the reactions, including the negative aspects like protests and the polarized reception.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each key moral point is included succinctly. Start with the inauguration and his goals, then the disruption, the dark vision, the protests, his mentions of truth and justice, the interference, and his policies. End with the changes he's bringing.

I think that covers all the main points and the moral framing. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to use the required words and stay within the word limit.
