SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to shatter the established order and restore lost greatness. In his dark and grim inaugural address, he painted a picture of an America afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and poverty. He vowed to fight for the people and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension was seen as a hostile takeover of the capital, disrupting the status quo. He took immediate action, rolling back Obama's policies and issuing orders to ease the burden of the Affordable Care Act. Despite the polarizing election, Trump showed no signs of reaching out to Democrats, and his speech was met with criticism from Democrats, who saw it as too dark and divisive. The inauguration was marked by peaceful protests, sporadic violence, and a sense of unease, as Trump began his presidency with less support in polls than any other president in recent history.
