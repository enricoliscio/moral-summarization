Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified certain morally framed words that should be included, like "restore," "ravages," "bring," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is inaugurated as the 45th president, presents himself as a populist leader to restore greatness, talks about the country's decline, uses strong language like "American carnage," and promises action. He criticizes politicians for talking without acting. 

He's surrounded by controversy, with protests and arrests. The inauguration was more subdued compared to Obama's. There's mention of his policies, like rolling back Obama's regulations and the Affordable Care Act. Also, his business ties and the moral implications of that are touched upon. 

I need to include as many of the specified words as possible. Let me list them: restore, ravages, bring, disruption, accept, action, poverty, stolen, carnage, violence, smashed, burned, responded, arrested, there, truth, justice, humor, love, interference, buy, hire, eradicate, terrorism, reaped, changes.

I'll structure the summary to cover Trump's inauguration, his rhetoric, the protests, his policies, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to use the words naturally within the context. 

I should start with Trump's inauguration and his vision to restore America. Mention the "ravages" and "poverty." Then talk about the disruption and the protests with smashed windows and burned cars, leading to arrests. Include his promises to bring back jobs and his "buy American, hire American" stance. Mention his pledge to eradicate terrorism and the moral issues like truth and justice. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence flows and includes the necessary moral terms without forcing them. 

Let me draft it:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president, vowing to restore America's greatness and address the ravages of economic decline. He painted a grim picture of poverty and carnage, promising action to bring back jobs, borders, and wealth. His inauguration marked a disruption, with protests leading to smashed windows, burned cars, and arrests. Trump criticized politicians for empty talk and pledged to eradicate terrorism, emphasizing a "buy American, hire American" agenda. Amidst controversy over Russian interference, his administration faced immediate challenges, including polarized support and questions about truth, justice, and the influence of his wealth and connections.

That seems to cover the key points and includes most of the moral words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Looks good. Now, I'll present the summary as per the user's instructions.
