END OF SUMMARY: Donald John Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, marking a hostile takeover of the capital and a disruption of the established order. In his inaugural address, he painted a grim picture of America, describing "American carnage" characterized by poverty, economic dislocation, and foreign exploitation. Mr. Trump positioned himself as the leader of a populist uprising, vowing to restore the country's lost greatness and to give power back to the people. He outlined a protectionist agenda, pledging to eradicate Islamic terrorism and addressing charges of prejudice against Mexicans and Muslims. Mr. Trump's ascension was unprecedented, as he was the first president to have never served in public office or the military, and his remarkable rise to power was fueled by his candor, disregard for convention, and connection with working-class Americans. While his inauguration followed tradition, his presidency has already been marked by controversy, with reports of Russian interference and questions about his business interests. Mr. Trump's dark vision of America was not well-received by Democrats, who criticized his address as overly negative and shocking. Protests and boycotts accompanied the inauguration, reflecting the lingering animosity from the campaign and the country's unsettled state after a polarizing election. Mr. Trump's presidency, marked by his outsider status and populist appeal, has ushered in a new era of American politics that breaks with convention.
