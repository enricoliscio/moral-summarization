SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his dark and grim inaugural address, he painted a picture of a country afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and poverty. He vowed to fight for the American people and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension to power was seen as a hostile takeover of the capital, with many Democrats and liberals viewing him as an outsider who has taken on the political establishment. Despite the polarizing election, Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats, and his speech was met with criticism from many who saw it as too dark and divisive. The inauguration was marked by peaceful protests, sporadic violence, and a sense of unease, with many wondering what the future holds for America under Trump's leadership.
