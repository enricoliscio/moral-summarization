SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, presenting himself as a populist leader who would reverse the country's decline. He outlined a grim vision of an America afflicted by economic and social issues, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension marked a significant disruption in Washington, with him positioning himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. In his inaugural address, he vowed to fight for the American people and outlined a protectionist agenda. He also promised to eradicate Islamic terrorism and addressed charges of prejudice against Mexicans and Muslims. Trump's rise to power was remarkable, transforming himself into the leader of a working-class movement despite his Ivy League education and mogul background. The inauguration followed tradition, with Trump and his wife, Melania, attending a church service and joining the Obamas and Bidens for coffee. Trump's speech, however, was strikingly dark, and he began rolling back Obama-era policies right away. Protests and sporadic violence marked the day, with more than 200 arrests made. Trump's presidency is unprecedented, as he is the oldest and one of the wealthiest presidents, with no prior political or military experience.
END OF SUMMARY.
