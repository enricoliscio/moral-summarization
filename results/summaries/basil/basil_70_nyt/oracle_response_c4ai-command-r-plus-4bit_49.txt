SUMMARY: In a ceremony marking a remarkable rise to power, Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, presenting himself as a populist leader who would restore lost greatness to a nation afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation. In his Inaugural Address, he vowed to "fight for you with every breath in my body" and promised that America would "start winning again". Mr. Trump's ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of Washington, with the new president positioning himself as an outsider not beholden to the established political system. He outlined a grim view of the country, describing "American carnage" characterized by poverty, rusted-out factories, and the ravages of drug and crime. Mr. Trump pledged to take action, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He also emphasized his commitment to "buy American and hire American," and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. The inauguration was not without controversy, with sporadic violence and protests against the new president. Democrats criticized his dark vision of America, and the crowds were notably smaller than at the previous inauguration. Mr. Trump's rise to power was unprecedented, with the 70-year-old real estate magnate and reality television star becoming the first president without prior political or military experience. His unconventional campaign appealed to working-class Americans, and he promised to disrupt the current system and give power back to the people.
