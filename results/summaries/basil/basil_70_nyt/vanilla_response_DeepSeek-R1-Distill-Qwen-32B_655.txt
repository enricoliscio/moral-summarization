Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about Trump being inaugurated as the 45th president, emphasizing a new era and his promises to change the established order. He presented himself as a populist leader aiming to restore America's greatness. The tone of his speech was quite dark, describing the country as in decline with issues like economic problems, foreign exploitation, and social issues like poverty and crime.

He mentioned his plan to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He criticized politicians for talking without action and promised immediate changes, starting with rolling back Obama's policies. The inauguration was a significant event, especially in a city that didn't support him much, with protests and arrests. The crowds weren't as large as Obama's first inauguration.

The article also touches on the political landscape, mentioning cabinet confirmations and some resistance from Democrats. Trump's background as a businessman without political experience is noted, along with his unconventional approach to politics. The ceremony included traditional elements, like attending church and a Bible swearing-in, but his speech focused on protectionism and fighting terrorism.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's inauguration, his populist message, the dark vision of America, policy rollbacks, the inauguration's atmosphere, and his unconventional background. I'll make sure to include the protests, the smaller crowd compared to Obama, and the traditional yet unconventional elements of his speech and ceremony.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Trump becoming president, his message, the inauguration's atmosphere, the protests, the political actions he took immediately, and his background. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
