SUMMARY: Donald John Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, presenting himself as a populist leader who would shatter the established order and restore the country's lost greatness. In his inaugural address, Trump outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by economic and foreign exploitation, pledging to reverse this "American carnage". He promised to fight for the American people and to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's rise to power has disrupted Washington, as he positioned himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. Protests and sporadic violence marked the day, as well as a largely peaceful women's march the following day. In his speech, Trump thanked his predecessor, Barack Obama, and his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also outlined a protectionist agenda, pledging to "buy American and hire American". Trump's inauguration marked a significant shift in American politics, with the new president promising to give power back to the people.
