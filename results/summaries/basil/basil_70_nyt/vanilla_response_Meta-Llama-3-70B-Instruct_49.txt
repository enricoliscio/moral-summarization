SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of America, afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, and vowed to fight for the people with every breath in his body. He outlined a protectionist agenda, promising to "buy American and hire American" and eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump's speech was notable for its grim tone, with no mention of tax cuts or restraining government. He also made a passing effort to reach out to Democrats, thanking Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The inauguration was marked by protests and sporadic violence, with over 200 people arrested. Trump's presidency begins with less support in polls than any other president in recent history.
