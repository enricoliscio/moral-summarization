SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, presenting himself as a populist leader who would restore the country's greatness and disrupt the established order. He outlined a grim vision of America, afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, poverty, and violence, which he referred to as "American carnage." Mr. Trump vowed to take action and fight for the American people, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He emphasized his outsider status and his willingness to challenge both political parties, and he highlighted his commitment to buying and hiring American, as well as eradicating Islamic terrorism. The inauguration was marked by peaceful protests and sporadic violence, with more than 200 arrests made. Mr. Trump's rise to power was remarkable, from a real estate magnate and reality television star to the leader of a working-class movement. At 70, he became the oldest first-term president, born in New York, and one of the wealthiest presidents. His speech was protectionist and unconventional, focusing on returning power to the people and addressing the issues of a small group reaping the rewards of government while the people bore the costs. Mr. Trump's ascension marked a significant disruption to Washington, with his actions beginning right away to roll back policies of his predecessor.
