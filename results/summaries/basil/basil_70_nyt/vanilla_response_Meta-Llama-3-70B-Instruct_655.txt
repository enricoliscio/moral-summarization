SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of an America afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, vowing to fight for the people and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He also took aim at politicians, saying they are all talk and no action. Trump's ascension marks a significant disruption in the capital, and he has taken on leaders of both parties, presenting himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system.

The inauguration was met with protests, with over 200 people arrested, and Democrats were not impressed with Trump's speech, calling it "dark" and "grim." Trump also signed orders freezing new regulations and easing the burden of the Affordable Care Act. The new president was sworn in with his wife Melania by his side, and he assumed the presidency with less support in polls than any other president in recent history.

END OF SUMMARY.
