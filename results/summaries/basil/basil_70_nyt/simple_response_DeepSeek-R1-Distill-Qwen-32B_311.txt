Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article about Trump's inauguration and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. They also mentioned that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral perspectives presented. The article describes Trump's inauguration, his rhetoric about the state of the country, his policies, and the reactions from different groups.

I notice that the article highlights Trump's vision of a struggling America, using terms like "American carnage" and "rusted-out factories." He presents himself as a savior figure, promising to bring back jobs and restore greatness. This sets up a moral contrast between his leadership and the previous administration, particularly Obama.

There's also a lot about the political divide. The inauguration was a polarizing event, with large protests and a divided Congress. Trump's outsider status and his disregard for traditional politics are emphasized, which is a moral stance against the established political order.

Additionally, the article touches on the moral concerns from Democrats and others about Trump's policies, such as his protectionist agenda and the potential conflicts of interest due to his wealth and business ties. The mention of Russian interference adds another layer of moral complexity.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements: Trump's rhetoric, the political division, his outsider status, and the moral concerns from critics. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing without being too biased.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce Trump's inauguration and his vision, then move to the political and social reactions, and finally touch on the moral criticisms. Keeping it balanced but highlighting the key moral points as presented in the article.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check to ensure all main points are covered and that the moral aspects are clearly presented.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, presenting himself as a populist leader determined to reverse what he called "American carnage." In a dark vision of the nation, Trump described a country plagued by economic decline, crime, and foreign exploitation, vowing to restore greatness through a "buy American, hire American" agenda. His speech emphasized action over political rhetoric, rejecting the status quo and promising to bring back jobs, borders, and wealth. Trump's inauguration marked a polarizing moment, with large crowds of supporters and widespread protests, including clashes and arrests. The event underscored deep divisions, as Trump entered office with low public support and faced immediate opposition from Democrats. His outsider status and brash rhetoric resonated with some as truth-telling, while others criticized his grim portrayal of the nation. The ceremony also highlighted the transition from Barack Obama, whose administration Trump sought to dismantle. Trump's inauguration was a symbolic shift in power, with a focus on returning control to the people, though his vision and methods sparked significant moral and political debate. END OF SUMMARY.
