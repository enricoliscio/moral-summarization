Okay, I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Trump becoming the 45th president, his inauguration ceremony, his speech, and the reactions. He presented a dark view of America, emphasizing economic issues and promising change. There were protests, and some Democrats were skeptical. The summary should include key points like the inauguration, his promises, the protests, and the historical context. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start with the main event, then his speech, the protests, and the significance of his background. Make sure to mention the divided reactions and the peaceful yet tense atmosphere. Also, note the historical aspects, like him being the oldest president and his business background. I'll ensure it's concise and covers all major points without getting too detailed.
