SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his dark and grim inaugural address, he painted a picture of a nation afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and poverty. He vowed to fight for the American people and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's ascension to power was seen as a hostile takeover of the capital, with many Democrats and liberals expressing shock and dismay at his divisive rhetoric. Despite the protests and unrest, Trump remained defiant, promising to take action and bring about change. The new president's vision for America was starkly different from his predecessors, with a focus on protectionism, nationalism, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. As he took office, Trump made it clear that he would not be beholden to the current system and would instead forge his own path.
