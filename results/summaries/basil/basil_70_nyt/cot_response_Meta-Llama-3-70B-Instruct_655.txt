SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse the "American carnage" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation. In a dark and grim inaugural address, he presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a vision of an America afflicted by poverty, crime, and drugs, requiring his can-do approach to turn around. Trump's ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. He promised to "eradicate from the face of the Earth" Islamic terrorism and to "bring back our jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams." The new president's view of the United States was strikingly grim, but he vowed to "fight for you with every breath in my body" and to "never, ever let you down."
