SUMMARY: In his inaugural address as the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump presented a dark and grim vision of America, referring to it as "American carnage." He vowed to restore lost greatness by outlining a protectionist agenda, pledging to "buy American and hire American," and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump's ascension marked a hostile takeover of the capital, with his rise to power being a disruption to the established order. He positioned himself as an outsider and a populist leader, promising to take action against political inaction and economic dislocation. He highlighted the issues of poverty, violence, and foreign exploitation, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. In his speech, Trump also acknowledged the presence of his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, and thanked former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition. However, his address was met with protests, and the crowds were not as large as those during Obama's first inauguration. Trump's presidency, marked by his untraditional background and business connections, presented a unique situation in American history. He is the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adams.
