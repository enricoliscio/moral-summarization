SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to "restore" lost greatness and "bring" back jobs, borders, and wealth. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of America afflicted by "the ravages" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his "can-do approach" to turn things around. He vowed to "fight" for the people and "never let them down." Trump's ascension marked a "hostile takeover" of the capital, disrupting the established order. He outlined a protectionist agenda, pledging to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism and promote "buy American and hire American" policies. The ceremony was met with protests, violence, and arrests, with over 200 people detained. Trump's speech was criticized by Democrats, who found it too dark and divisive. Despite the controversy, Trump remains committed to his vision of "restoring" America's greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
