Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Trump's inauguration and some specific instructions. Let me break this down.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I should look for words that carry moral connotations, like "carnage," "ravages," "disruption," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each of these words, listing them under STEP 1.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be no more than 200 words and should end with the specified tokens. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's inauguration, his rhetoric about the state of the country, his policies, the protests, and the political divide.

I should ensure that the summary captures the moral tone, highlighting the division, the grim vision of the country, and the actions taken by Trump. I'll also mention the reactions from both supporters and opponents to show the contrasting perspectives.

Let me make sure I include all the necessary elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the inauguration, moving to his speech and policies, the protests, and the broader implications of his presidency.

I think I've got a good grasp of what's needed. Time to put it all together.

### SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, vowing to reverse the nation's decline and restore "lost greatness." His speech painted a grim picture of America, describing it as afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and social ills like poverty, crime, and drug abuse. Trump promised to "make America great again" by bringing back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. His inauguration marked a polarizing moment, with large crowds of supporters and widespread protests, including acts of violence and arrests. Trump's rhetoric, which disregarded political conventions, resonated with his base but drew criticism for its dark tone and divisiveness. His administration began with rolling back Obama-era policies, signaling a shift in governance. The event highlighted the nation's deep political divide, with many questioning Trump's vision and methods. END OF SUMMARY.
