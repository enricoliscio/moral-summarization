SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse the "American carnage" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation. In his dark and grim inaugural address, he presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He promised to "fight for you with every breath in my body" and bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's view of the United States was strikingly grim, with mothers and children trapped in poverty, rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones, and drugs and crime stealing lives. He declared that "this American carnage stops right here and stops right now." The new president's message was met with protests and skepticism from Democrats, who were not impressed by his "dark" vision. END OF SUMMARY.
