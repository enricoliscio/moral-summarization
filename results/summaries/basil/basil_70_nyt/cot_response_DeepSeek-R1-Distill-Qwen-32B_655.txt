Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the steps as per their instructions.

First, I should identify all the single words in the text that are morally framed. These are words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "hostile," "disruption," "outsider," "empty," "action," "dark," "carnage," "poverty," "rusted-out," "tombstones," "drugs," "crime," "stolen," "grace period," "protests," "violence," "arrested," "boycott," "untraditional," "truth-telling," "disenchanted," "prejudice," "wealth," "reap," "cost," and "transfer." Each of these words has a clear moral or evaluative tone.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: Trump's inauguration, his vision of a struggling America, his populist approach, the political disruption, the protests, and the moral implications of his policies and rhetoric.

I'll make sure to include words like "hostile takeover," "disruption," "outsider," "dark vision," "carnage," "poverty," "rusted-out," "tombstones," "stolen," "grace period," "protests," "violence," "arrested," "boycott," "untraditional," "truth-telling," "disenchanted," "prejudice," "wealth," "reap," "cost," and "transfer." These words highlight the moral framing and the contentious nature of Trump's presidency as portrayed in the article.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, capturing the essence of the article while emphasizing the moral aspects. I'll structure it to first introduce Trump's inauguration and his vision, then discuss the political and social reactions, and finally touch on the broader implications of his presidency.

Now, putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that's concise, includes the key morally framed words, and stays within the word limit. I'll make sure each sentence contributes to the overall moral framing and accurately reflects the original article's tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th U.S. president, presenting himself as a populist leader to "shatter the established order" and reverse "this American carnage." His dark vision of a struggling nation, afflicted by poverty, crime, and foreign exploitation, emphasized a "hostile takeover" of Washington. Trump vowed to "bring back" jobs, borders, wealth, and American greatness, while dismissing political inaction and promising decisive "action." His inauguration was marked by protests, violence, and arrests, reflecting deep political divisions. Trump's untraditional approach, with no prior political experience, positioned him as an "outsider" not beholden to the system. Despite his promises to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism and promote "buy American," his rhetoric on immigration and trade raised concerns about prejudice. The ceremony highlighted a transfer of power from Washington to the people, but many questioned his vision and methods. END OF SUMMARY.
