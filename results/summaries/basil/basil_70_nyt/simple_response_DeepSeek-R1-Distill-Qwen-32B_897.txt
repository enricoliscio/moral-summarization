Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Trump's inauguration while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The article describes Trump's inauguration, his speech, his vision for America, and the reactions from different groups.

I notice that the author frames Trump's speech as a dark vision of America, highlighting economic decline and national decline. Trump presents himself as an outsider, promising change and action. The article also mentions the protests and the divided reactions, showing the polarizing nature of his presidency.

I should capture the moral aspects: Trump's rhetoric about American carnage, his promises to bring back jobs and borders, and his criticism of the political establishment. Also, the contrast between his supporters and the protesters, as well as the historical context of his inauguration compared to Obama's.

I'll need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, focusing on the main moral points without getting bogged down in details. I'll structure it to highlight Trump's vision, his outsider status, the protests, and the symbolic aspects of his inauguration.

Now, I'll start drafting the summary, making sure to include the key moral elements and keep it within the word limit.
