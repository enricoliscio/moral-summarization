SUMMARY: In his inaugural address, Donald Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore America's greatness, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse national decline. He outlined a grim vision of a nation afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, poverty, and crime, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. His ascension marked a hostile takeover of Washington, D.C., by an ultimate outsider who saw himself as beholden to neither political party. Trump's view of America was strikingly negative for an Inaugural Address, but he pledged to fight for the people with every breath and promised action over empty talk. He outlined a protectionist agenda, pledging to buy American and hire American, and vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism while rejecting prejudice. Trump positioned himself as a disruptor, transferring power from Washington back to the people, and promised an end to the era of a small group reaping the rewards of government while the people bore the costs. His inauguration marked a significant disruption to the established order and a rejection of the current system, with Trump promising to fight for those who felt left behind. END OF SUMMARY.
