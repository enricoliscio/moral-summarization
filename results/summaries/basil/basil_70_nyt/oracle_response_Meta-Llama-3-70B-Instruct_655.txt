SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to "shatter the established order" and reverse a national decline he called "this American carnage." In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of an America afflicted by "the ravages" of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his "can-do approach" to "bring back" lost greatness. He promised to "fight for" the people with every breath in his body and "never, ever let them down." Trump's ascension was a "hostile takeover" of a capital facing its most significant "disruption" in generations. He took on leaders of both parties, presenting himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system. Trump's view of the United States was strikingly grim, describing a country where mothers and children are "trapped in poverty" and where drugs and crime "have stolen too many lives." He vowed to "eradicate" Islamic terrorism and "bring back" jobs, borders, and wealth. The day was marked by mostly peaceful protests, but sporadic "violence" broke out, resulting in over 200 arrests.
