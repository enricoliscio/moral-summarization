SUMMARY: Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, presenting himself as a populist leader who would restore the country's lost greatness. He outlined a grim vision of America, plagued by poverty, economic dislocation, and foreign exploitation, and pledged to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. In his Inaugural Address, Trump vowed to fight for the people and take action against empty talk. He promised to "buy American and hire American," and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. His ascension marked a hostile takeover of Washington, DC, and a disruption to the established order. Protests against the new president turned violent as demonstrators smashed windows and burned a limousine, resulting in arrests. Trump's swearing-in ceremony was attended by past presidents and marked a significant departure from convention, as he became the oldest and wealthiest president sworn in for the first time. He assumed the presidency with less support in polls than any other recent president and faced challenges regarding his business connections and Russian interference in the election. Trump's rise to power showcased his ability to connect with working-class Americans and speak truth to power. His inauguration marked a transfer of power back to the people, away from a small group in Washington who had reaped the rewards.
