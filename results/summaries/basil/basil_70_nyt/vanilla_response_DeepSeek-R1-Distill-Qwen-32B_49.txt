Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's inauguration. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by talking about Trump being inaugurated as the 45th president, emphasizing a new era and his populist approach. He presents a dark vision of America, highlighting economic struggles and promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. He criticized politicians for talking without action and started reversing Obama's policies immediately.

There's a mention of the inauguration ceremony, his attire, the oath administered by the Chief Justice, and Vice President Pence's swearing-in. It also notes the protests, arrests, and the smaller crowd compared to Obama's inauguration.

The article contrasts Trump's outsider status with the political establishment, his business background, and the divisions in the country. It touches on the presence of previous presidents and the transition process, including the Obamas leaving the White House.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary of under 200 words. I'll focus on the main events: Trump's inauguration, his rhetoric about America's state, his policy rollbacks, the inauguration ceremony details, the protests, and the political climate. I'll make sure to include key points like his populist message, the economic and social issues he highlighted, and the immediate actions he took after taking office.

I should also mention the political divisions, the protests, and the symbolic aspects like the Bible used during the oath. Keeping it within the word limit, I'll ensure each sentence captures a significant aspect without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it step by step: start with the inauguration and his message, then his policy actions, the ceremony details, the protests, and the political climate. Make sure to include the contrast between Trump's approach and the traditional inauguration elements.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and concise, hitting all the key elements without exceeding the word limit.
