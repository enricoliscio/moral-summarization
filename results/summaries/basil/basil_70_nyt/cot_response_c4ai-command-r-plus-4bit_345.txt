SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th president of the United States marked a hostile takeover of Washington, DC, with a grim and dark vision for the country. In his Inaugural Address, Trump painted a picture of "American carnage," ravaged by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, poverty, rusted-out factories, drugs, and crime. He vowed to fight for the people, promising to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's rise to power was unprecedented, as an outsider with no prior political career, he positioned himself against leaders of both parties and the current system. He outlined a protectionist agenda, pledging to "buy American and hire American," and eradicate Islamic terrorism while rejecting prejudice. Trump's ascension disrupted the established order, with his untraditional background and protectionist agenda. The transfer of power was not without controversy, with protests, boycotts, and animosity from those opposed to his election. Trump's speech was shocking and failed to reach across the aisle, but his supporters cheered him on, wearing "Make America Great Again" hats. The new president's actions, including rolling back Obama-era policies, signaled a hostile takeover and a break from tradition. Trump, the oldest and one of the wealthiest presidents, with business interests worldwide, faced questions about his interests and the country's interests. His disregard for convention and offensive remarks during the campaign came across as refreshing candor to his supporters but were shocking to his detractors.
