SUMMARY: Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, marking a significant disruption in Washington with his populist message and outsider status. In his Inaugural Address, Trump painted a grim picture of America, promising to restore its lost greatness by reversing economic dislocation and foreign exploitation. He vowed to fight for the American people and to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. Trump's rise to power was remarkable, as he transformed himself into the leader of a working-class movement despite his Ivy League education and real estate mogul background. He assumed the presidency with less support in polls than any other recent president and faced protests and boycotts during his inauguration. In his speech, Trump outlined a protectionist and anti-terrorism agenda, pledging to "buy American and hire American" and eradicate Islamic terrorism. He also promised to give power back to the people, taking it away from the small group in Washington that has reaped the rewards of government. Trump's ascension marked a new era of political disruption and a shift away from the established order.
END OF SUMMARY.
