SUMMARY:

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, promising to restore America's lost greatness and shatter the established order. In his inaugural address, he presented a dark vision of an America afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and poverty, and vowed to fight for the people with every breath in his body. He outlined a protectionist agenda, promising to "buy American and hire American" and to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Trump's speech was notable for its lack of conciliatory tone, and Democrats were unimpressed. Protests against Trump's presidency broke out throughout the day, with over 200 people arrested. Despite the polarizing election, Trump made passing efforts to reach out to Democrats, thanking Obama and Clinton for their handling of the transition. The inauguration marked a significant disruption in Washington, with Trump's unconventional style and populist rhetoric set to shake up the political establishment.
