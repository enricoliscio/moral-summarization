SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse a national decline he called "this American carnage." In a dark and grim inaugural address, he presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a vision of an America afflicted by economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around. Trump promised to fight for Americans with every breath in his body and never let them down, vowing to bring back jobs, borders, wealth, and dreams. His view of the United States was strikingly grim, with mothers and children trapped in poverty, rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones, and drugs and crime stealing too many lives. Trump declared that "this American carnage stops right here and stops right now." END OF SUMMARY.
