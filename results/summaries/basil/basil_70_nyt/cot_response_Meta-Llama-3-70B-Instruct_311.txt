SUMMARY:
Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, vowing to shatter the established order and reverse the "American carnage" he described. In his dark and grim Inaugural Address, he presented a vision of an America afflicted by economic dislocation, foreign exploitation, and poverty, requiring his can-do approach to turn around. He promised to "fight for you with every breath in my body" and bring back lost greatness, jobs, borders, and wealth. Trump's ascension was seen as a hostile takeover of a capital facing significant disruption, with him positioning himself as an outsider not beholden to the current system. He vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism and pledged to "buy American and hire American." The inauguration was marked by peaceful protests and sporadic violence, with Democrats criticizing Trump's dark vision of the country. END OF SUMMARY.
