SUMMARY: The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives, a historic first, turned into a moral debate between Republicans and Democrats over which parts of the document to include. Republicans chose to skip over sections they considered obsolete and superseded by amendments, such as the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person, while Democrats argued that reading the entire document, imperfections and all, is crucial to understanding the nation's ongoing struggle for improvement. The debate reflected a deeper divide between those who view the Constitution as a sacred text to be worshiped and those who see it as a living document that should be constantly improved upon to reflect the nation's changing values and beliefs. While some lawmakers criticized the exercise as political theater or propaganda, others defended it as a symbolic reminder of the country's founding principles and the importance of limited government. The reading also sparked discussions about the need for an Equal Rights Amendment to guarantee women's equality, highlighting the ongoing struggle to update and improve the nation's founding document. END OF SUMMARY.
