SUMMARY:

The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud by newly sworn House members sparked controversy as Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts, including those related to slavery and Native Americans. Democratic lawmakers argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's struggle to improve the document. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emotionally expressed that omitting these parts would lose the significance of the struggles of African Americans, women, and others to create a more perfect document. Rep. Elijah Cummings stated that not reading the full document, including amended text, would fail to show Americans that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to improve is a blessing. Critics, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, deemed the exercise as "total nonsense" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. Supporters, however, saw it as a symbolic reminder that the Constitution is the foundation of laws and a valuable exercise to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers. END OF SUMMARY.
