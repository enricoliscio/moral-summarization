SUMMARY: The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives, a historic first, was mired in controversy as Republicans decided to skip over sections they deemed obsolete and superseded by amendments. This decision sparked outrage among Democrats who viewed it as an attempt to whitewash history and undermine the struggle for a more perfect union. They argued that reading only the amended version failed to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and ongoing struggle for improvement. The debate centered on whether the Constitution is a sacred text to be worshiped or a living document to govern by. Supporters of the reading believed it served as a valuable reminder of the aspirations of the Founding Fathers and the importance of limited government. However, critics labeled it as mere theater and propaganda, highlighting the document's imperfections and the need for amendments to address issues like slavery and women's rights. The event underscores the differing interpretations of the Constitution and the ongoing battle over its meaning and relevance in modern-day America. END OF SUMMARY.
