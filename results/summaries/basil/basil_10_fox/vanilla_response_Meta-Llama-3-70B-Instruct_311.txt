SUMMARY:

The newly sworn members of the US House of Representatives read the US Constitution aloud on Thursday, but Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts that have been superseded by amendments. Democrats objected, arguing that this undermined the exercise's objective and failed to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history. The reading sparked debate, with some lawmakers calling it a "ritualistic" and "propagandistic" waste of time, while others saw it as a historic moment and a reminder of the Constitution's importance. Supporters argued that it was a valuable exercise to remind Congress of the document's aspirations and limitations. The reading also sparked discussions about the Constitution's imperfections, with some calling for updates, such as the Equal Rights Amendment to guarantee women's equality.

END OF SUMMARY.
