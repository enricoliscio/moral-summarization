SUMMARY:
The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud on the House floor sparked controversy as Republicans skipped obsolete parts, including those that counted slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's "struggle" to improve the document. Rep. Elijah Cummings said it was a "failure to show Americans that imperfection is not to be feared" and that the ability to constantly improve the document is a "blessing". Others, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, deemed the exercise "total nonsense" and "propaganda", arguing that the Constitution is a "living document" that shouldn't be followed to the letter. Despite criticisms, supporters saw the reading as a "symbolic" and "historic" moment, reminding Congress that the Constitution is the foundation of all laws. END OF SUMMARY.
