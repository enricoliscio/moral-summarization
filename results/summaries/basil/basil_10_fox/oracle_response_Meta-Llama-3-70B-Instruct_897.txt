SUMMARY:

The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud on the House floor sparked controversy as Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts, including those related to slavery and Native Americans. Democratic lawmakers argued that this undermines the exercise's objective, as it fails to acknowledge the nation's ongoing struggle to improve the document and create a more perfect union. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emotionally expressed that omitting these parts would lose the significance of the struggle for African Americans, women, and others. Rep. Elijah Cummings stated that reading only the amended Constitution fails to show Americans that imperfection is not to be feared, and that our ability to constantly improve is a blessing. Critics, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, deemed the exercise as "total nonsense" and "propaganda," arguing that the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter. Supporters, on the other hand, saw it as a historic moment, symbolizing the government's foundation on laws, not men. END OF SUMMARY.
