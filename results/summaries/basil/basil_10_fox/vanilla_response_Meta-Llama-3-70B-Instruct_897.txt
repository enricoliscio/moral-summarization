SUMMARY:

The newly sworn members of the US House of Representatives read the US Constitution aloud on Thursday, but Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts that have been superseded by amendments. This decision sparked controversy among Democratic lawmakers, who argued that exempting parts of the document undermines the exercise's objective. They claimed that reading only the amended Constitution fails to acknowledge the nation's struggles and imperfections. Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, criticized the exercise as "ritualistic" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. However, supporters saw the reading as an historic moment, symbolizing the government's foundation on laws rather than men. The debate highlights differing views on the Constitution's significance and its role in shaping the government.
