Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution aloud, but they skipped some parts. Republicans decided to skip obsolete sections, like the 18th Amendment on prohibition and the parts about slaves and Native Americans. Democrats were upset, saying it undermines the exercise and ignores the struggles that led to amendments. They argued that omitting parts fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history. Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., felt it was emotional and important to include all parts. Others criticized the exercise as a ritual, calling it propaganda and a waste of money. Supporters, however, saw it as a symbolic moment to remind Congress that they're a government of laws, not men. The article also mentions the Equal Rights Amendment efforts outside the Capitol. I need to capture the key points: the skipped parts, the Republican vs. Democratic viewpoints, the symbolic vs. practical arguments, and the broader debate on the Constitution's interpretation. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the main arguments from both sides. Also, mention the historical context and the significance of the reading. Let me structure it: start with the event, explain what was skipped, the arguments from both parties, and the symbolic versus practical views. Make sure to highlight the debate on the Constitution's perfection and its amendments. Keep it balanced and clear.
