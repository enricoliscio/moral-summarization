SUMMARY: A debate has emerged regarding the reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives, with Republicans choosing to omit certain sections they deemed obsolete and superseded by amendments. This decision sparked controversy among Democratic lawmakers, who viewed it as an attempt to undermine the true meaning of the exercise. They argued that reading only the amended version failed to acknowledge the nation's ongoing struggle for improvement and its imperfect beginnings. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and other lawmakers emphasized the importance of recognizing the struggles of African Americans, women, and others to create a more perfect union. The debate highlights differing interpretations of the Constitution, with some viewing it as a sacred text to be worshiped, and others as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. The exercise was criticized as "ritualistic" and "propaganda" by some, while supporters saw it as a symbolic reminder of the Founding Fathers' aspirations for limited government. The reading of the Constitution in this context has sparked discussions about the document's relevance and interpretation in modern times, with some arguing that it is not meant to be viewed as fluid advice but as a foundation for limited government.
