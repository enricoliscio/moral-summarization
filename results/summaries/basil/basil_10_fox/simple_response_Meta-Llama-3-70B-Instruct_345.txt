SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives' attempt to read the Constitution aloud turned into a controversy when Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts, including those related to slavery and prohibition. Democratic lawmakers argued that this undermined the exercise's purpose, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and its ongoing struggle for improvement. They believed that reading the entire document, including amended parts, was essential to show that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to improve is a blessing. Critics, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler, saw the exercise as "total nonsense" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. However, supporters viewed it as a symbolic moment, reminding Congress that the Constitution is the foundation of US laws. The debate highlighted differing views on the Constitution's role, with some seeing it as a living document to be improved upon, and others believing it should be followed to the letter.
