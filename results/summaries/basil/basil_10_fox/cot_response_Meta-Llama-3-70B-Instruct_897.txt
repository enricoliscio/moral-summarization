SUMMARY:
The newly sworn members of the House read the U.S. Constitution aloud, but Republicans skipped the obsolete parts, sparking controversy. Democrats argued that exempting parts of the document undermines the objective of the exercise, which is to acknowledge the "imperfect" beginnings and history of the country. They claimed that reading only the amended Constitution is a "failure to show Americans" that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to constantly improve is a "blessing". Republicans, on the other hand, saw the exercise as a "symbolic" and "valuable" moment to remind Congress that the Constitution is the foundation of all laws. Historians and experts weighed in, with some calling the exercise "ritualistic" and "propaganda", while others saw it as a necessary reminder of the importance of limited government. END OF SUMMARY.
