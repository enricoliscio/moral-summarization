Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed article about the US Congress reading the Constitution, and they want a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get the gist. It seems like the House read parts of the Constitution, skipping some amended sections, which caused a debate between Republicans and Democrats. The Republicans wanted to skip obsolete parts, but Democrats felt that was disrespectful to the struggles and amendments that made the Constitution better.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They provided a list, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary without making it sound forced.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the main points: the reading event, which parts were skipped, the Republican reasoning, the Democratic opposition, and the broader implications. I should use words like "struggle," "create," "amendment," "improve," "failure," "seek," "propaganda," "abolish," "injustices," "worship," "govern," etc.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be selective. I'll start with the event, mention the skipped parts, then the opposing viewpoints. I'll include quotes from Jackson and Inslee to show the moral stance. Then, I'll touch on the broader debate about the Constitution being a living document versus a sacred text.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and includes the key moral arguments from both sides. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the "END OF SUMMARY." token as instructed. I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure to incorporate the moral framing words naturally.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. House of Representatives recently read portions of the Constitution, but Republicans skipped outdated sections, sparking debate. Democrats argued that omitting parts like the 18th Amendment (prohibition) and the three-fifths clause undermines the document's historical struggle and ongoing improvement. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the importance of acknowledging the Constitution's imperfect beginnings and the desire to continue improving it. Others criticized the exercise as "propaganda," arguing the Constitution is a living document that should not be worshiped but used to govern. Republicans defended the reading as a symbolic reminder of the rule of law, though some viewed it as political theater. The debate highlighted divisions over whether the Constitution should be seen as a static foundation or a fluid guide for progress. END OF SUMMARY.
