SUMMARY:
The U.S. House of Representatives' decision to read the Constitution aloud sparked controversy when Republicans chose to skip obsolete parts. Democrats argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's "struggle" to improve the document. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. called it "emotional" and emphasized the importance of reading the entire document, including its "imperfect" beginnings. Critics like Rep. Jerrold Nadler deemed the exercise "ritualistic" and "propaganda," while supporters saw it as a "symbolic" and "valuable" moment. The debate highlighted the Constitution's imperfections and the need for ongoing improvement. Meanwhile, outside the Capitol, advocates pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment, citing the document's "far from perfect" nature. END OF SUMMARY.
