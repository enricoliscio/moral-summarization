Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution. It started with the idea of reading the entire document, but Republicans decided to skip some parts that are outdated, like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause. Democrats were upset because they felt this undermines the exercise's purpose. They argued that omitting parts erases the struggles and history behind the amendments. Some lawmakers, like Jesse Jackson Jr., emphasized the importance of including all parts to show the ongoing effort to improve the country. Others, like Jay Inslee, wanted clarity on why certain parts were skipped.

On the other side, Republicans, including Bob Goodlatte, saw it as a symbolic reminder of the rule of law. Supporters thought it was a historic moment, the first time the Constitution was read on the House floor. Critics, like Jerrold Nadler, called it a waste and propaganda, arguing the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be taken literally. There were also mentions of the cost and the Equal Rights Amendment push outside.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the decision to skip parts, the Republican and Democratic reactions, the symbolic vs. practical views, and the broader implications of the exercise.
