SUMMARY: Reading the Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives sparked controversy as Republicans omitted parts deemed obsolete due to amendments, including the Three-Fifths Clause and the 18th Amendment on liquor prohibition. Democratic lawmakers criticized this approach, arguing that reading the entire document, including amended portions, acknowledges the nation's ongoing struggle for improvement. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the emotional significance, highlighting the fight for the rights of African Americans and women. Other lawmakers, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, criticized the ritualistic reading, stating that the Constitution is a living document subject to amendments and should not be worshiped but followed in governance. Supporters of the reading viewed it as a symbolic reminder of the foundation of American laws and the aspirations of the Founding Fathers. Historians and scholars offered differing opinions on the significance, with some seeing it as a political move by Republicans to claim the Constitution as a tool to reduce government size. The debate underscores the differing interpretations of the Constitution's role in modern governance.
