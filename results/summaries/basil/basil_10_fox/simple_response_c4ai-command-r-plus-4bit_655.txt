SUMMARY: Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives recently engaged in a historic but contentious exercise of reading the U.S. Constitution aloud on the House floor. The reading, however, was not without controversy as Republicans decided to skip over portions of the document that have been superseded by amendments, such as the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers criticized this approach, arguing that reading an amended version of the Constitution undermines the struggle for a more perfect union and fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and ongoing efforts to improve the document. Some, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, went as far as to call the ritualistic reading "propaganda," while others defended it as a symbolic reminder of the country's founding principles and the need for limited government. The debate highlights the differing interpretations of the Constitution, with some viewing it as a sacred text and others as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. Despite the criticisms, supporters of the reading believe it is important to aspire to the Founding Fathers' ideals and acknowledge the Constitution as the foundation of the nation's laws.
