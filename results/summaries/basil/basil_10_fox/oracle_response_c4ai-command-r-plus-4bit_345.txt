SUMMARY: Newly sworn members of the U.S. House recently engaged in a historic yet contentious exercise: reading the Constitution aloud on the House floor. The reading, however, was not without controversy. Republicans decided to skip over parts of the Constitution that have been superseded by amendments, such as the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers criticized this decision, arguing that reading the amended Constitution undermines the struggle to improve and create a more perfect union. They believe that acknowledging the nation's imperfect beginnings and ongoing desire to seek improvement is crucial. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., stated that failing to read the full document is a failure to "keep our Republic" and to show Americans that imperfection should not be feared but embraced as an opportunity for growth. Other lawmakers criticized the exercise altogether, calling the Constitution a living document that should not be worshiped but used to govern. Despite the criticism, supporters of the reading believe it is a valuable reminder of the aspirations of the Founding Fathers and the importance of limited government. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle to interpret and improve upon the nation's founding document, ensuring that it remains a relevant and guiding force in the present day.
END OF SUMMARY.
