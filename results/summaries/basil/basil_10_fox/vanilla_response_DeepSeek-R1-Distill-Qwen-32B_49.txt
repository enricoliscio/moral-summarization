Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. House of Representatives reading the Constitution aloud. Hmm, I remember that they did this a few years back, right? But there's some controversy here.

Alright, the main points: The newly sworn-in House members were reading the Constitution, but Republicans decided to skip some parts. Like the 18th Amendment, which was about prohibition, and parts that counted slaves as three-fifths of a person. They thought these parts were outdated because they've been amended. But Democrats were upset because they felt it undermines the exercise. They wanted to include all parts, even the amended ones, to show the struggle and progress the country has made.

Some Democrats, like Jesse Jackson Jr., felt it was emotional and important to include all parts to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings. Others, like Jay Inslee, wanted an explanation of why certain parts were skipped. There was also criticism that the Constitution is a living document and shouldn't be taken literally. Some called the reading a ritual or propaganda.

On the other side, supporters, including Republicans, saw it as a symbolic moment to remind Congress that they're a government of laws, not men. They thought it was important to revisit the Constitution's principles. Historians and think tank people weighed in, with some saying it's just theater but not insignificant, while others thought it was necessary to remind Congress about limited government.

Outside the Capitol, some were pushing for the Equal Rights Amendment, pointing out that the Constitution isn't perfect and needs updating.

So, the summary needs to capture the conflict between Republicans skipping parts and Democrats wanting to include everything. It should mention the amendments, the emotional aspect, the criticism of the reading as propaganda, and the symbolic support. Also, the push for ERA is a minor point but worth noting.

I should structure it to first state what happened, then the Republicans' decision, followed by Democratic objections, the reasons on both sides, and the broader implications. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and balanced.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives recently read the U.S. Constitution aloud, but the exercise sparked controversy as Republicans skipped certain outdated or amended sections, such as the 18th Amendment (prohibition) and the three-fifths clause regarding slaves. Democrats criticized this decision, arguing it undermines the document's historical struggle and imperfections. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the importance of acknowledging the nation's imperfect beginnings, while Rep. Jay Inslee called for clarity on why certain parts were excluded. Critics, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler, labeled the reading as "ritualistic" and "propaganda," arguing the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be taken literally. Supporters, however, viewed the exercise as a symbolic reminder of the rule of law and the need to adhere to constitutional principles. Some historians and analysts debated the significance, with Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute arguing for limited government, while others saw it as a political spectacle. Meanwhile, advocates outside the Capitol pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment, highlighting the Constitution's imperfections and the need for modernization. END OF SUMMARY.
