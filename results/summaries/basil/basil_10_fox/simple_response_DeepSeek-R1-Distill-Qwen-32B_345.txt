Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution, but they skipped some parts. Republicans decided to omit outdated sections, like the 18th Amendment (Prohibition) and the parts about slavery and Native Americans. Democrats were upset because they felt it undermined the exercise's purpose. They argued that omitting parts ignores the struggles and imperfections in the Constitution's history.

I need to capture the conflict between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans wanted to focus on the amended parts, while Democrats wanted to include the original, flawed sections to show the country's progress. There were mentions of the Equal Rights Amendment, showing the ongoing effort to improve the Constitution.

I should highlight the moral points: Democrats emphasizing the importance of acknowledging the Constitution's imperfections and the struggle for equality, while Republicans focused on the current, amended document. The debate reflects differing views on how to interpret and honor the Constitution.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the summary includes both sides' arguments and the underlying moral implications.
