SUMMARY: Newly sworn members of the U.S. House recently engaged in a historic first reading of the Constitution on the House floor. However, the event was marred by controversy as Republicans selectively omitted sections of the document that have been superseded by amendments, such as the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers criticized this decision, arguing that reading the entire document, imperfections and all, is crucial to understanding the nation's ongoing struggle for improvement and recognizing the importance of amendments in shaping the country's history. They believed that reading only the amended version undermines the exercise's objective and fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and ongoing struggle for a more perfect union. Some, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, even called the ritualistic reading "propaganda," arguing that the Constitution is a living document that should be constantly improved upon rather than worshiped. Supporters of the reading, however, believed it was a valuable reminder of the aspirations of the Founding Fathers and a symbol of a government of laws, not men. The debate highlighted the differing interpretations of the Constitution's role in modern governance, with some seeing it as a tool to reduce government size, while others view it as a guide to ensure limited government and protect individual freedoms.
END OF SUMMARY.
