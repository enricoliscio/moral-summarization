Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution, but some parts were skipped because they're outdated. The author used specific morally charged words, and I need to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Republicans decided to skip parts of the Constitution that have been amended, like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause. Democrats were upset because they felt this undermined the original struggles and amendments that improved the document. They argued that omitting parts fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history and the ongoing desire to improve. Some saw it as propaganda, while others viewed it as a symbolic reminder of the government's foundation.

Now, I need to identify the key moral words from the list provided. Words like "struggle," "create," "amendment," "improve," "desire," "continue," "explain," "determinations," "fail," "keep," "failure," "seek," "divisiveness," "reading," "propaganda," "amendments," "abolish," "slavery," "injustices," "worship," "govern," "read," "leave," "decided," "regulates," "redistributes," "ensure," "free," "planning," "living," "dependents," "tell," "filled," "further," "ratified," "holding," "far," "guarantee."

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the conflict between Republicans and Democrats, the reasons for skipping parts, the moral implications, and the symbolic nature of the reading.

I'll start by mentioning the Republicans skipping parts, then the Democrats' concerns about failing to acknowledge the struggle and amendments. I'll include the idea that omitting parts is a failure to show the ongoing desire to improve. Then, touch on the criticism of the reading as propaganda versus the symbolic value. Finally, mention the broader debate about the Constitution being a living document and the desire to improve it.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence incorporates some of the key terms.

SUMMARY: Republicans in the U.S. House skipped parts of the Constitution during a reading, omitting outdated sections like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause. Democrats criticized this, arguing it failed to acknowledge the nation's struggle and amendments aimed at improving the document. They contended that omitting parts undermines the desire to continue improving and risks divisiveness. Some viewed the exercise as propaganda, while others saw it as a symbolic reminder of the government's foundation. The debate highlighted the Constitution's role in regulating and redistributing wealth, with some advocating for limited government. Critics emphasized the document's imperfections, like its failure to guarantee women's equality, and the need to address injustices through amendments. The reading was seen as an opportunity to govern by the Constitution, not to worship it, while others questioned its fluidity. The event sparked broader discussions on the Constitution's evolving nature and the ongoing struggle to create a more perfect union. END OF SUMMARY.
