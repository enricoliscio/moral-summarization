Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the U.S. Congress reading the Constitution aloud, but there's a debate about which parts to include. Let me break this down.

First, the Republicans decided to skip parts that have been amended, like the 18th Amendment (prohibition) and the three-fifths clause. They argue that since those parts are obsolete, they shouldn't be read. But Democrats are upset because they think omitting those parts undermines the historical struggle and the ongoing effort to improve the Constitution. They see it as a failure to acknowledge the nation's imperfect past and the continuous effort to make progress.

Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., feel it's emotional because of the struggles African Americans and women have had. They don't want the amendments to overshadow the original document's imperfections. Others, like Rep. Jay Inslee, want clarity on why certain parts were excluded.

There's also criticism from Democrats who view the Constitution as a living document that shouldn't be taken literally. They argue that the Founders weren't perfect, and the Constitution has needed amendments, like abolishing slavery. They see the reading as propaganda for Republicans.

On the other side, supporters, like Rep. Bob Goodlatte, think it's a symbolic reminder that the government is based on laws, not men. They believe it's an important moment, though some see it as just theater.

Historians and experts have different opinions. Alan Brinkley thinks it's a bit of theater but not insignificant, while Roger Pilon from the Cato Institute thinks it's necessary to remind Congress of limited government principles.

Outside, activists are pushing for the Equal Rights Amendment, pointing out that the Constitution isn't perfect, especially regarding women's equality.

So, the moral framing here is about whether the Constitution should be seen as a perfect, unchangeable document or as a living, evolving one that reflects the nation's ongoing struggles and improvements. The debate is not just about which parts to read but about the values and principles the document represents and how they should be interpreted today.

I need to capture this debate, highlighting the opposing views on the Constitution's nature and the implications of omitting certain parts. The summary should reflect the moral concerns from both sides: the Democrats' emphasis on acknowledging imperfection and the struggle for progress, versus the Republicans' focus on the amended, current document as a foundation of law.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key points from both sides without getting too bogged down in details. Focus on the moral and symbolic aspects, the arguments about history and progress, and the implications for how the Constitution is viewed and used today.
