SUMMARY:
The U.S. House of Representatives' reading of the Constitution aloud sparked controversy as Republicans skipped "obsolete" parts, including those related to slavery and prohibition. Democrats argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's "imperfect" beginnings and ongoing struggle for improvement. Rep. Elijah Cummings stated that not reading the full document, including amended parts, was a "failure to show Americans" that imperfection is not to be feared. Meanwhile, some lawmakers, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, deemed the exercise "total nonsense" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. Historian Alan Brinkley called it "a bit of theater," but noted its significance in highlighting the need for limited government. The debate surrounding the reading also drew attention to efforts to update the document, such as the Equal Rights Amendment.
