SUMMARY:

The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud on the House floor sparked controversy as Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts, such as the 18th Amendment and the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and the ongoing struggle to improve the Constitution. They believed that reading the full document, including amended parts, was essential to show that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to constantly improve is a blessing. In contrast, some lawmakers saw the exercise as a waste of time and money, and others viewed the Constitution as a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter. The debate highlighted differing views on the Constitution's significance and its role in governing the country.
