SUMMARY:

The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives sparked controversy as Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts, including those that have been superseded by amendments. Democrats argued that this undermines the objective of the exercise, which is to acknowledge the struggle of African Americans, women, and others to create a more perfect document. They believe that reading only the amended parts fails to show Americans that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to constantly improve the document is a blessing. Republicans, on the other hand, see the exercise as a symbolic showing to the American people, reminding them that the Constitution is the foundation for all laws. Historians and experts weigh in, with some calling the reading a "bit of theater" and others seeing it as a necessary reminder of the importance of limited government. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle to improve the Constitution and ensure a more perfect union.
