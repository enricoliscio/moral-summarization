Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution aloud. Republicans decided to skip some parts that have been amended, like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause. Democrats are upset because they think omitting parts undermines the Constitution's history and the struggles to improve it. They argue it's important to show the document's imperfections and the ongoing effort to make it better. Some Democrats, like Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., feel it's emotional because of the struggles of African Americans and women. Others, like Rep. Jay Inslee, want clarity on why certain parts were skipped.

Republicans, on the other hand, see this as a symbolic gesture to remind Congress that it's a government of laws, not men. They believe it's a way to honor the Constitution's role in limiting government. Some, like Roger Pilon, argue that the Constitution shouldn't be seen as a blank slate but as a foundation for limited government. Critics, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, call the reading "propaganda" and say the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed rigidly.

The author uses words like "struggle," "create," "amendment," "improve," "failure," "seek," "propaganda," "abolish," "slavery," "injustices," "worship," "govern," "read," "leave," "decided," "regulates," "redistributes," "ensure," "free," "planning," "living," "dependents," "tell," "filled," "further," "ratified," "holding," "far," "guarantee." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the event, then the Republicans' approach, followed by the Democrats' objections, and then the broader debate about the Constitution's nature. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to highlight the conflicting views on the Constitution's perfection, amendments, and the struggle for equality.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words and including the key moral terms. I'll start with the event, then the Republicans skipping parts, Democrats' concerns about failing to acknowledge the struggle, the desire to improve, the reading as propaganda, amendments to abolish slavery, the need to govern, and the debate over whether the Constitution is a sacred text or a living document.

I should also mention the broader implications, like the Constitution being a foundation for limited government versus a document that needs updating. Finally, I'll note the opposing views on whether the reading was symbolic or a missed opportunity to address ongoing issues like women's equality.

Now, putting it all together concisely, making sure to include the moral framing words and keep the summary within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House read the Constitution aloud, but Republicans skipped amended sections, sparking moral debate.

Jerrold Nadler called the reading "propaganda," arguing the Constitution is a living document, not a sacred text. Republicans viewed it as a symbolic reminder of limited government, with Roger Pilon stressing the Founders' intent for freedom. The debate highlighted the tension between viewing the Constitution as a static foundation or a fluid, imperfect document. Democrats, including Rep.

The event underscored the moral imperative to address imperfection and continue the struggle for justice, while critics like NOW's Terry O'Neill pointed out the Constitution's failure to guarantee women's equality. END OF SUMMARY.
