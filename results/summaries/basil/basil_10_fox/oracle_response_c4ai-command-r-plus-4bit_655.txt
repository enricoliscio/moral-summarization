SUMMARY: Newly sworn members of the U.S. House of Representatives recently engaged in a historic yet contentious exercise of reading the Constitution aloud. The reading, however, was not without controversy, as Republicans decided to skip over parts of the document they deemed obsolete and superseded by amendments. This decision sparked debate among Democratic lawmakers who believed that reading the entire document, including its amendments, was essential to acknowledging the nation's ongoing struggle to improve and create a more perfect union. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and other Democratic representatives argued that excluding parts of the Constitution undermines the objective of the exercise and fails to recognize the country's imperfect beginnings and ongoing struggle for improvement. The reading also drew criticism from those who viewed the Constitution as a living document not to be worshipped but to govern the government by. Despite the criticism, supporters of the reading maintained that it was a valuable exercise and a symbolic reminder of the foundations of U.S. law. The debate highlights the differing interpretations of the Constitution and the ongoing struggle to improve upon the document and the nation's imperfect history. END OF SUMMARY.
