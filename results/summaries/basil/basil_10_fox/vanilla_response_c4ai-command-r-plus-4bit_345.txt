SUMMARY: The U.S. Constitution was read aloud on the House floor for the first time in history, but the event was marred by partisan disagreement over which parts of the document to include. Republicans chose to omit sections that have been superseded by amendments, such as the 18th Amendment on liquor prohibition, while Democrats argued that reading the unamended Constitution would undermine the exercise's purpose. The dispute reflected differing interpretations of the Constitution, with Republicans viewing it as a vehicle to reduce government size and Democrats emphasizing its imperfection and ongoing need for improvement. Despite criticism from some lawmakers and commentators, supporters maintained that the reading was a valuable reminder of the country's founding principles and the aspirations of the Founding Fathers. The event also drew attention to ongoing efforts to amend the Constitution, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, which seeks to guarantee women's equality.
END OF SUMMARY.
