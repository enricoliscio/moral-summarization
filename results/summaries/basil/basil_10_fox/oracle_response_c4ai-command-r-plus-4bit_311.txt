SUMMARY: Reading the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives turned into a partisan affair, with Republicans and Democrats disagreeing on how to interpret and present the document. While Republicans chose to skip over parts of the Constitution that have been amended or superseded, such as the Three-Fifths Compromise and prohibition, Democrats argued that reading only the amended document undermined the struggle for improvement and the desire to continue creating a more perfect union. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and other Democratic lawmakers expressed their emotions and concerns, stating that reading only the amended document fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and ongoing struggle to improve. They believed that reading the entire document, including its imperfections, is a reminder of the ability to constantly improve and a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness. The reading was the first time the Constitution had been read aloud in the House, and some supporters viewed it as a symbolic reminder of the foundation of U.S. laws and the aspirations of the Founding Fathers. However, critics like Rep. Jerrold Nadler derided the exercise as propaganda, stating that the Constitution is not a sacred text to be worshiped but a guide for governing. The debate highlighted the different interpretations and values assigned to the Constitution by both parties, with Republicans emphasizing limited government and Democrats focusing on the struggle for improvement and equality.
