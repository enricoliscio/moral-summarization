SUMMARY: The U.S. Constitution was read aloud on the House floor for the first time in history, but the event was marred by partisan bickering over which parts of the document to include. Republicans decided to skip over sections that have been superseded by amendments, such as the 18th Amendment imposing prohibition, while Democrats argued that reading the entire document, warts and all, is important to acknowledge the nation's ongoing struggle for improvement. Some lawmakers criticized the exercise altogether, calling it "propaganda" and arguing that the Constitution is a living document that should not be worshipped but interpreted and amended as society evolves. The reading was intended to emphasize limited government and the Founding Fathers' aspirations, but it also highlighted the deep ideological divide in Congress. The event's supporters saw it as a valuable reminder of the country's foundational principles, while critics deemed it a wasteful political stunt. END OF SUMMARY.
