SUMMARY: Republicans in Congress decided to skip reading certain parts of the U.S. Constitution, deeming them obsolete and superseded by amendments. This decision sparked controversy among Democrats who viewed it as an attempt to ignore the nation's imperfect history and ongoing struggle for improvement. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and others argued that reading the entire document, including its imperfections, is essential to acknowledge the struggles of marginalized groups and to show that imperfection should not be feared but improved upon. The debate reflected differing interpretations of the Constitution, with some viewing it as a sacred text and others as a living document. The reading was criticized as theater and propaganda by some, while others defended it as a symbolic reminder of the limited government intended by the Founding Fathers. The debate highlighted the moral framing of words like "imperfection", "worship", and "struggle", showcasing the complexity of interpreting the Constitution's moral and practical implications.
