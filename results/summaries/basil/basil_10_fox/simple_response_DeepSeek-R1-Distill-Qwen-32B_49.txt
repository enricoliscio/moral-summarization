Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution, but some parts were skipped because they're outdated or amended. The Republicans did this, skipping parts like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause. Democrats were upset, saying it undermines the struggle for equality and the imperfect beginnings of the document. They felt it was important to read the whole thing to show the nation's history of improvement. Some Democrats called the exercise a waste, while others saw it as symbolic, emphasizing the rule of law. Supporters saw it as a historic moment, but critics argued it was just propaganda. The article also mentions the Equal Rights Amendment outside, highlighting the ongoing need for updates.

I need to capture the conflict between Republicans skipping parts and Democrats wanting the full reading. Highlight the moral points about acknowledging the nation's imperfect past and the struggle for equality. Also, note the differing views on the Constitution as a living document versus a sacred text. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives recently read the U.S. Constitution aloud, but Republicans skipped certain outdated or amended sections, sparking controversy. They omitted parts like the 18th Amendment (prohibition) and the three-fifths clause, which counted enslaved individuals and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democrats criticized this, arguing that excluding these sections undermines the document's historical struggle for equality and the nation's imperfect beginnings. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the importance of acknowledging the Constitution's imperfections and the ongoing effort to improve it. Others, like Rep. Jay Inslee, questioned the selective reading, while Rep. Jerrold Nadler called the exercise "propaganda" and criticized worshiping the Constitution. Supporters, including Rep. Bob Goodlatte, viewed the reading as a symbolic reminder of the rule of law. Critics argued it was a political stunt, while some, like Rep. Steve Israel, saw it as a valuable moment to reflect on the Founders' aspirations. The debate highlighted differing views on the Constitution as a living document versus a sacred text. Outside the Capitol, advocates pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment, highlighting the need for ongoing updates to address equality. END OF SUMMARY.
