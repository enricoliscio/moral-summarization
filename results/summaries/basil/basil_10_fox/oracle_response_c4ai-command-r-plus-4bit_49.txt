SUMMARY: Newly sworn members of the U.S. House recently engaged in a historic first: reading the Constitution aloud on the House floor. However, the exercise was not without controversy. Republicans decided to skip over parts of the document that have been amended or superseded, such as the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. This decision was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers who argued that reading the amended portions is important to acknowledge the struggle for improvement and the ongoing desire to create a more perfect union. They believed that reading the full document, including its imperfect beginnings and amendments, is essential to show that imperfection should not be feared and that the ability to improve upon the Founders' work is a blessing, not a cause for divisiveness. The reading was also criticized by those who viewed the Constitution as a living document, not to be worshiped but to govern by. Despite the controversy, supporters of the reading believed it was a valuable reminder of the aspirations of the Founding Fathers and the importance of limited government. The debate surrounding the reading highlights the differing interpretations of the Constitution and the ongoing struggle to improve and seek a more perfect union. END OF SUMMARY.
