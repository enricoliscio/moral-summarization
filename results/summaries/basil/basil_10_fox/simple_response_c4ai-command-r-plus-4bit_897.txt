SUMMARY: The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives, a historic first, turned into a partisan debate over whether to omit parts of the document that have been superseded by amendments. While Republicans argued that reading only the current, operative language would be more meaningful, Democrats insisted that reciting the entire document, including its imperfect and amended portions, serves as a crucial reminder of the nation's ongoing struggle to improve and perfect the union. The debate reflected a deeper divide between those who view the Constitution as a sacred text and those who see it as a living document open to interpretation and amendment to reflect the changing societal needs and values. The exercise also drew criticism from those who deemed it a wasteful political stunt, while others defended it as a symbolic reminder of the country's foundational principles. The controversy surrounding the reading underscores the ongoing tension between originalism and a more flexible interpretation of the Constitution, highlighting the complex and often contentious nature of constitutional interpretation in American politics.
