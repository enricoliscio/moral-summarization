SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives' decision to read the Constitution aloud sparked controversy when Republicans chose to skip obsolete parts, such as the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths compromise on slaves and Native Americans. Democrats argued that omitting these sections undermined the exercise's purpose, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history and ongoing struggle for improvement. They believed that reading the full document, including amended parts, was essential to show that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to improve the Constitution is a blessing. Republicans, on the other hand, saw the exercise as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's importance and a chance to re-commit to its principles. The debate highlighted differing views on the Constitution's role, with some seeing it as a living document that should be adapted to modern times, and others viewing it as a sacred text that should be followed closely.
