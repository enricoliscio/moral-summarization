Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I have to identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the House reading the Constitution, but skipping some parts. The author uses words like "battle," "struggle," "sacred," "imperfect," "dedication," "failure," "worship," "propaganda," "dependence," "ratified," "equality," and "update." These words carry moral connotations, so I'll list them as STEP 1.

Next, I need to summarize the article, preserving these moral terms. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: the reading of the Constitution, the parts skipped, the Democratic objections, the Republican justifications, and the broader debate about the Constitution's nature.

I should include the moral framing words where appropriate. For example, the Democrats emphasize the "struggle" and "imperfect beginnings," while Republicans argue for a "limited government." Also, the mention of the Equal Rights Amendment ties into the "equality" aspect.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. I'll structure it to first describe the event, then the opposing views, and finally the implications of the debate.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the moral terms and keep it under 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and concise, capturing the essence of the article's moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
The U.S. House of Representatives recently read portions of the Constitution aloud, but some members skipped parts deemed obsolete or amended. Democrats criticized this, arguing it undermines the document's historical struggles, such as those of African Americans and women, and fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings. They emphasized the importance of recognizing the Constitution's imperfections and ongoing efforts to improve it. Republicans defended the exercise, viewing it as a symbolic reminder of the rule of law and limited government. Critics, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler, called the reading "propaganda" and questioned its value, while supporters saw it as a historic moment. The debate highlighted differing views on whether the Constitution should be followed strictly or seen as a living document. Outside the Capitol, advocates pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment, highlighting the Constitution's lack of guarantees for women's equality. The event sparked broader discussions about the document's role in governance and its imperfections.
