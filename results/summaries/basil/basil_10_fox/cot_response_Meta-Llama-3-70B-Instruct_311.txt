SUMMARY:
The reading of the U.S. Constitution aloud in the House sparked controversy as Republicans chose to skip obsolete parts, including those related to slavery and prohibition. Democrats argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's "imperfect beginnings" and "struggle" for a more perfect union. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emotionally stated that skipping these parts would "lose" the significance of the document. Others, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, deemed the exercise "total nonsense" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. Meanwhile, supporters saw it as a "symbolic" and "valuable" reminder of the Constitution's importance. Historians and experts weighed in, with some calling it a "bit of theater" and others seeing it as a necessary reminder of the Founding Fathers' "aspirations" for limited government. END OF SUMMARY.
