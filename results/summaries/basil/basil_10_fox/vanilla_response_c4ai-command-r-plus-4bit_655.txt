SUMMARY: The U.S. Constitution was read aloud on the House floor for the first time in history, but the event was marred by partisan bickering over which parts of the document to include. Republicans decided to skip over sections they considered obsolete and superseded by amendments, such as the 18th Amendment on prohibition, while Democrats argued that reading the unamended Constitution would undermine the exercise's purpose. The debate highlighted the different interpretations of the Constitution, with some viewing it as a sacred text and others as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. Historians and lawmakers alike weighed in on the significance of the reading, with some criticizing it as political theater and others defending it as a valuable reminder of the country's founding principles. The event also sparked discussions about the imperfections of the Constitution and the ongoing struggle to improve it, such as the push for the Equal Rights Amendment to guarantee women's equality. Despite the criticisms and controversies, supporters of the reading saw it as a symbolic reminder of the importance of the Constitution in American governance.
