SUMMARY: A debate arose among members of the U.S. House of Representatives regarding the reading of the Constitution aloud. The contention was whether to include outdated and amended portions, such as the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. While Republicans argued that superseded sections could be skipped, Democrats believed that omitting these parts undermined the objective of the exercise and failed to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history and ongoing struggle for improvement. Some lawmakers criticized the ritualistic reading of the Constitution as propaganda and worship, while others supported it as a symbolic reminder of the aspirations of the Founding Fathers and the importance of limited government. The debate highlighted differing interpretations of the Constitution, with some viewing it as a sacred text and others as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. The event marked the first time the Constitution was read on the House floor, sparking discussions about the nation's founding principles and the role of government.
