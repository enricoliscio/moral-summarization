Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's going on. The article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution aloud, but there was some controversy about which parts they read. 

Hmm, the Republicans decided to skip some parts that are outdated, like the 18th Amendment which was about prohibition, and also the parts about counting slaves as three-fifths of a person. The Democrats were upset because they felt it undermines the original document's history and the struggles it represents. They wanted to include all parts, even the amended ones, to show the ongoing effort to improve the country.

Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., felt it was emotional because of the history of African Americans and women. Others, like Rep. Jay Inslee, wanted clarity on why certain parts were skipped. Rep. Elijah Cummings also criticized the decision, saying it fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect past.

On the other hand, some Democrats, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, criticized the whole exercise as "ritualistic" and "propaganda," arguing that the Constitution isn't perfect and shouldn't be worshipped. Supporters, however, saw it as a symbolic moment to remind Congress that they're a government of laws, not men.

Historians had different opinions. Alan Brinkley called it theater but noted its significance, while Roger Pilon from the Cato Institute thought it was necessary to remind Congress about limited government. Meanwhile, Rep. Nadler and others were advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment outside, pointing out the Constitution's imperfections regarding women's equality.

So, the main points are: the House reading the Constitution, Republicans skipping outdated parts, Democrats upset about omitting parts, criticism about the exercise being symbolic or propaganda, and the broader debate about the Constitution's nature and amendments.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the controversy, the reasons each side gave, and the significance of the event. I should make sure to mention the key points without getting too detailed.
