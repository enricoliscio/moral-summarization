SUMMARY:

The U.S. House of Representatives' decision to read the Constitution aloud sparked controversy when Republicans opted to skip obsolete parts, including those related to slavery and Native Americans. Democrats argued that this undermined the exercise's purpose, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's ongoing struggle to improve the document. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the emotional significance of reading the entire Constitution, including its imperfect beginnings, to recognize the country's continued pursuit of a more perfect union. Others, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, deemed the exercise "total nonsense" and "propaganda," arguing that the Constitution is a living document that should be governed by, not worshiped. Historians and lawmakers debated the significance of the reading, with some seeing it as a valuable reminder of the Founding Fathers' aspirations and others as a political stunt. The controversy highlighted the ongoing struggle to improve the Constitution and ensure limited government. END OF SUMMARY.
