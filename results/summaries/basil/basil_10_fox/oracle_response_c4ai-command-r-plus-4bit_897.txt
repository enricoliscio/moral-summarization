SUMMARY: A historic first reading of the U.S. Constitution in the House turned into a battle between Republicans and Democrats over which parts of the document to include. Republicans chose to skip over sections they deemed obsolete and superseded by amendments, such as the 18th Amendment on liquor prohibition, while Democrats argued that reading the entire document, including amended portions, is crucial to acknowledging the nation's ongoing struggle to improve and create a more perfect union. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and other Democratic lawmakers expressed their desire to highlight the struggle for equality and the imperfect history of the country. They believed that reading only the current version of the Constitution fails to show Americans the importance of constantly striving for improvement. The reading, however, was supported by some lawmakers who saw it as a symbolic reminder of the aspirations of the Founding Fathers and the foundation of the nation's laws. The debate surrounding the reading reflects the differing interpretations of the Constitution, with some viewing it as a sacred text and others as a living document that should not be worshipped but rather used to govern the government. The event also drew criticism from those who saw it as political propaganda and a waste of resources.
