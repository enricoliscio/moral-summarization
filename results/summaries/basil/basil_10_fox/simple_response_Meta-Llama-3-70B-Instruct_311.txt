SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives' attempt to read the Constitution aloud sparked controversy when Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts that have been superseded by amendments. Democrats argued that this undermined the exercise's objective, as it failed to acknowledge the nation's struggles to improve the document. They believed that reading the full document, including amended parts, was essential to show that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to constantly improve is a blessing. Republicans, on the other hand, saw the exercise as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's importance and the need to limit government. Critics argued that the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter, while supporters believed it was a valuable exercise to remind Congress of the document's aspirations.

END OF SUMMARY.
