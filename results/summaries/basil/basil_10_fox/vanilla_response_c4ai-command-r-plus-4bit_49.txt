SUMMARY: In a symbolic gesture, the U.S. Constitution was read aloud on the House floor for the first time in history by newly sworn members of Congress. However, the reading was not without controversy as Republicans decided to omit parts of the document that have been superseded by amendments, such as the 18th Amendment imposing prohibition, and the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers criticized this decision, arguing that it undermines the objective of the exercise and fails to acknowledge the ongoing struggle for a more perfect union. Some lawmakers also criticized the exercise altogether, describing the Constitution as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. Historians and supporters of the reading offered differing opinions on the significance of the event, with some seeing it as a reminder of the Founders' intentions for limited government, while others viewed it as political theater. The reading also sparked calls for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment to update the Constitution with a statement on women's equality.
END OF SUMMARY.
