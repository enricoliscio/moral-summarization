Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House read the Constitution, but skipped some parts, leading to a debate between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats felt this undermined the exercise, while Republicans saw it as symbolic.

I should identify the key moral concepts here. Words like "struggle," "create," "amendment," "improve," "desire," "continue," "explain," "fail," "keep," "failure," "seek," "divisiveness," "reading," "propaganda," "abolish," "slavery," "injustices," "worship," "govern," "read," "leave," "decided," "regulates," "redistributes," "ensure," "free," "planning," "living," "dependents," "tell," "filled," "further," "ratified," "holding," "far," "guarantee" are important.

I need to structure the summary to include these words. Start with the event: reading the Constitution. Then, explain the debate: some parts were skipped, which Democrats saw as failing to acknowledge the struggle. Mention the amendments, abolish slavery, injustices. Then, the Republicans' view: symbolic, governance, not propaganda. Also, include the historian's perspective on limited government and the ERA push.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure each sentence flows and includes the moral framing. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring all key points are covered with the moral words included.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives recently read the Constitution aloud, but skipped parts deemed obsolete, sparking debate. Democrats argued this failed to acknowledge the struggle to improve the document and the nation, while Republicans saw it as a symbolic gesture to remind Congress of its founding principles. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the importance of recognizing the document's imperfections and the ongoing desire to create a more perfect union. Critics like Rep. Jerrold Nadler dismissed the exercise as propaganda, arguing the Constitution is meant to govern, not to be worshipped. Historians and conservatives weighed in, with some emphasizing the need to ensure limited government and others advocating for amendments to abolish injustices like slavery. The debate highlighted the tension between viewing the Constitution as a living document and a fixed framework. Meanwhile, advocates outside the Capitol pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment, criticizing the idea of the Constitution as a sacred, perfect document. END OF SUMMARY.
