SUMMARY:

The newly sworn members of the US House of Representatives read the US Constitution aloud on Thursday, but Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts that have been superseded by amendments. Democrats criticized this decision, arguing that it undermines the objective of the exercise and fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history. The omitted sections included the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition, and the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Some lawmakers felt that the exercise was a waste of time and money, while others saw it as a historic moment and a reminder of the Constitution's importance. The debate also touched on the document's imperfections and the need for ongoing improvement. Meanwhile, outside the Capitol, advocates pushed for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment to update the Constitution with a statement on women's equality.
