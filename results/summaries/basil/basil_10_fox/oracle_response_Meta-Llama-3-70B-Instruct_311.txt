SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives' decision to read the Constitution aloud sparked controversy as Republicans opted to skip obsolete parts, including those related to slavery and Native Americans. Democrats argued that this undermines the exercise's objective, as it fails to acknowledge the nation's ongoing struggle to improve the document. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized that reading only the amended parts would lose the significance of the struggles of African Americans, women, and others who fought to create a more perfect document. Rep. Elijah Cummings added that not reading the full document, including amended parts, is a failure to show Americans that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to improve the document is a blessing. Meanwhile, some lawmakers and historians viewed the exercise as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's importance, while others saw it as propaganda or a waste of time. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle to balance the document's imperfections with its aspirations for a more perfect union. END OF SUMMARY.
