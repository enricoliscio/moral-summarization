SUMMARY:

In a historic moment, the U.S. Constitution was read aloud on the House floor, but not without controversy. Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts, such as the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition, and the section counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Democratic lawmakers argued that omitting these parts undermines the exercise's objective, as it fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history and the struggles of African Americans, women, and others to create a more perfect document. They believe that reading the full document, including amended parts, is essential to show that imperfection is not to be feared and that the ability to improve the Constitution is a blessing. Critics, on the other hand, view the exercise as "ritualistic" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. Despite the controversy, supporters see the reading as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's importance and a call to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.
