SUMMARY:

The newly sworn members of the US House of Representatives read the US Constitution aloud on Thursday, but Republicans decided to skip certain obsolete parts that have been superseded by amendments. Democrats objected, arguing that this undermines the exercise's objective and fails to acknowledge the nation's struggles to improve the document. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and others felt that skipping certain parts, such as the counting of slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person, diminishes the significance of the Constitution's evolution. Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, criticized the exercise as "ritualistic" and "propaganda," while others saw it as a historic moment and a reminder of the Constitution's importance. Historians and experts weighed in, with some arguing that the Constitution is a living document that needs to be updated, while others believed it should be revered as a foundation for limited government.
