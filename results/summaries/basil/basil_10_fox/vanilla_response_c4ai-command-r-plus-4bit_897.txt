SUMMARY: In a historic first, the U.S. Constitution was read aloud on the House floor, but the event was marred by partisan bickering over which parts to include. Republicans, who organized the event, decided to omit sections that have been superseded by amendments, such as the 18th Amendment on prohibition, while Democrats argued that reading the entire document, warts and all, was important to understanding the nation's imperfect history and ongoing struggle for improvement. Some lawmakers criticized the exercise as "propaganda," while others defended it as a valuable reminder of the Founding Fathers' aspirations for limited government. The reading was also criticized by those who view the Constitution as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. Outside the Capitol, others pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment to be added to the Constitution to guarantee women's equality. The event highlighted the ongoing debate over the interpretation and relevance of the Constitution in modern American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
