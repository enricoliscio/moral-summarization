SUMMARY: A debate emerged in the U.S. House of Representatives over the reading of the Constitution, with Republicans choosing to omit sections they deemed obsolete and superseded by amendments. Democratic lawmakers criticized this approach, arguing that excluding parts of the document undermines the exercise's objective and fails to acknowledge the nation's ongoing struggle for improvement. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the emotional significance, highlighting the fight for equality by African Americans and women. Other Democrats, such as Rep. Elijah Cummings, questioned the reading of an "amended" Constitution, stating that it erases the nation's imperfect history and fails to showcase the ability to improve upon the Founders' work. While some lawmakers dismissed the exercise as propaganda and worship of a "sacred text," others defended it as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's foundational role in American governance. The reading highlighted the differing interpretations of the Constitution, with some seeing it as a tool to limit government overreach and others as a living document that should not be followed to the letter. The debate underscores the ongoing political and moral discourse surrounding the interpretation and application of America's founding document.
