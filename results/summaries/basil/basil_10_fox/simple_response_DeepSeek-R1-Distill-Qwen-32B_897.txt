Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the U.S. House reading the Constitution, but Republicans skipped some parts. Democrats were upset because those parts, even though amended, are still part of the document's history. They felt it was important to include everything to show the struggles and improvements over time. Republicans, on the other hand, thought it was symbolic to read the current, amended version. Some lawmakers criticized the exercise as unnecessary or propaganda, while others saw it as a positive step towards governance.

I should highlight the conflict between the two parties: Democrats emphasizing the historical and moral aspects, Republicans focusing on the current Constitution. Also, mention the broader debate about whether the Constitution is a living document or a fixed one.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to capture the moral arguments from both sides without going over 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the reading, the parts skipped, the Democratic concerns, Republican justifications, and the ongoing debate about the Constitution's nature.

Let me structure it: start with the event, explain what happened, then the opposing views, and end with the broader implications. Make sure to include the emotional and symbolic elements mentioned by the lawmakers.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together clearly and concisely.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. House of Representatives recently read the U.S. Constitution aloud, but Republicans skipped certain sections, including the 18th Amendment (prohibition) and the three-fifths clause regarding slavery. Democrats criticized this decision, arguing that omitting parts of the Constitution undermines its historical and moral significance. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. emphasized the struggles of marginalized groups in shaping the document, while Rep. Elijah Cummings warned that excluding amended sections fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings and ongoing efforts to improve. Republicans defended the exercise as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's role in limiting government and upholding the rule of law. Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, criticized the reading as "propaganda," arguing the Constitution is a living document that should not be worshipped but used to govern. The debate highlighted broader disagreements about the Constitution's natureâ€”whether it is a static foundation or a dynamic tool for progress. END OF SUMMARY.
