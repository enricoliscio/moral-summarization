Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about the U.S. House of Representatives reading the Constitution aloud. It started as a simple exercise but turned into a debate. Republicans decided to skip certain parts, like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause, because they've been amended or are outdated. Democrats were upset, arguing that omitting parts undermines the Constitution's history and the struggles to improve it. They felt it was important to read the entire document to acknowledge the nation's imperfect beginnings. Some lawmakers, like Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., emphasized the ongoing struggle for equality. Others, like Rep. Jay Inslee, wanted clarity on why certain parts were skipped.

There were different opinions on the value of the exercise. Some saw it as symbolic and a reminder of the rule of law, while others, like Rep. Jerrold Nadler, criticized it as ritualistic and propaganda. Historians had mixed views too. The article also mentions efforts to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, highlighting the Constitution's need for updates.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the reading exercise, the parts skipped, the Republican and Democratic perspectives, the symbolic vs. practical views, and the broader debate on the Constitution's nature and amendments.

I should make sure to include the main争议点，即删减部分宪法内容是否恰当，以及不同议员的观点。还要提到宪法作为活的文件和不断完善的必要性。最后，可以提到等权修正案的努力，显示宪法需要更新。

现在，把这些要点组织成连贯的段落，确保不超过200字。
