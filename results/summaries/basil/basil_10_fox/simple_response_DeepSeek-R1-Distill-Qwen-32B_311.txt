Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about the U.S. House reading the Constitution. Republicans decided to skip some parts that have been amended, like the 18th Amendment and the three-fifths clause. Democrats are upset because they think it's important to include all parts to show the nation's struggle and imperfections. They argue that omitting parts undermines the exercise's purpose.

On the other hand, Republicans see it as symbolic, emphasizing the Constitution's role as the foundation of laws. Some lawmakers, like Nadler, criticize the reading as ritualistic and not meaningful. Others, like Pilon, argue that the Constitution should be followed strictly to limit government.

I need to capture both sides: the moral arguments about acknowledging the Constitution's imperfections and the symbolic value. Also, mention the debate over the exercise's purpose and the cost involved.

I should structure the summary to first mention the event, then the Republicans' decision, followed by Democrats' objections, and then the broader debate on the Constitution's nature. Keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft it concisely, making sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives recently read the U.S. Constitution aloud, but Republicans chose to skip certain outdated or amended sections, sparking debate. Democrats argued that omitting parts like the three-fifths clause and the 18th Amendment undermines the exercise's purpose, as it fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history and ongoing struggles for equality. They emphasized the importance of recognizing the Constitution's imperfections and the collective effort to improve it. Republicans, however, viewed the reading as a symbolic reminder of the Constitution's role as the foundation of U.S. law. Some lawmakers criticized the exercise as ritualistic or propaganda, while others, like historian Roger Pilon, argued for strict adherence to the original document to limit government overreach. The debate highlighted differing views on whether the Constitution is a living, evolving document or a fixed framework meant to constrain government power. END OF SUMMARY.
