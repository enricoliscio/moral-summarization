SUMMARY:

The newly sworn members of the US House of Representatives read the US Constitution aloud on Thursday, but not in its entirety. Republicans decided to skip obsolete parts that have been superseded by amendments, sparking controversy among Democratic lawmakers. Democrats argued that reading only the amended version undermines the exercise's objective and fails to acknowledge the nation's imperfect history. Republicans countered that the reading was a symbolic showing of the Constitution's importance and a reminder of the government's foundation. The debate highlighted differing views on the document's significance, with some seeing it as a living document that should be updated and others believing it should be followed to the letter. The reading was also criticized as a political stunt, with some estimating it cost over $1 million.
