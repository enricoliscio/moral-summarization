Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and the specific morally framed words to include: affairs, scandals, influenced. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that claims Cruz had affairs. Cruz denied the allegations. The article mentions the Enquirer's history with scandals, like John Edwards and Tiger Woods. Trump denied any involvement, and the Enquirer's parent company also denied being influenced by Trump.

Now, I need to make sure to include the words "affairs," "scandals," and "influenced." I should structure the summary to highlight the accusations, denials, and the context of the Enquirer's reputation.

I'll start by mentioning Cruz's accusation, the content of the Enquirer's story, his denial, and the moral implications. Then, I'll include Trump's response and the Enquirer's denial of influence. Finally, I'll note the Enquirer's history with scandals to maintain the moral framing.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points are covered. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accused Donald Trump of enlisting "friends at the National Enquirer" to publish a story alleging he had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the claims, calling them "garbage." The story sparked a surreal exchange on CNN, where a columnist accused Cruz's former communications director of an affair with him. Trump denied involvement, stating he had "nothing to do with the National Enquirer" and criticized Cruz for surrounding himself with "political hacks." The Enquirer, known for breaking sex scandals, denied being influenced by Trump backers, asserting its reporting integrity. Cruz's allegations and the Enquirer's story highlight the moral implications of affairs and scandals in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
