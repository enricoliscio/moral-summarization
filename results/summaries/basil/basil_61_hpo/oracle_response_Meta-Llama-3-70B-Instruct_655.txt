SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using his connections with the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about Cruz's personal life, including allegations of extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the scandals, calling them "garbage." The tabloid's story sparked a heated exchange on CNN, with Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen accusing Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz. Trump responded by denying any involvement with the Enquirer and distancing himself from the scandal, saying Cruz's problem with the tabloid is his own. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of John Edwards and Tiger Woods. The tabloid's parent company denied that Trump backers influenced the story, standing by the integrity of their coverage.
