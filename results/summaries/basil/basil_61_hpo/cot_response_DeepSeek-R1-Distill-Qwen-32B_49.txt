Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task involves two main steps: first, identifying all the morally framed words in the provided news article, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral framings.

Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Sen. Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer and political henchmen to spread rumors about him. The Enquirer published a story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women, which he denied. There was an exchange on CNN where someone accused Cruz's former director of having an affair. Trump denied involvement, and the Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump's backers.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all single words that carry a moral connotation. I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph.

In the first paragraph, words like "lashed out," "enlisting," "friends," "henchmen," "bidding," "garbage," "surreal," "accused," "affair." These words have moral implications: "lashed out" shows anger, "enlisting" and "henchmen" suggest manipulation, "garbage" is a strong denial, "surreal" indicates absurdity, and "accused" and "affair" relate to moral wrongdoing.

In the second paragraph, Trump's statement uses "garbage," "nothing to do with," "political hacks," "henchmen," "pretend innocence," "problem," "right," "others," "hope." These words carry moral judgment: "garbage" again, "nothing to do with" shows denial, "hacks" and "henchmen" are derogatory, "pretend innocence" is a criticism, "problem" is a negative assessment, "right" in the sense of correct accusations, and "hope" is a cautious endorsement.

The third paragraph mentions the Enquirer's "infamous reputation," "tabloid journalism," "sex scandals," "extramarital affairs," "deny," "influence," "reporting," "integrity," "coverage," "aggressive." These terms have moral connotations: "infamous" is negative, "tabloid" suggests sensationalism, "sex scandals" are moral issues, "deny" is a refusal, "influence" implies manipulation, "integrity" is about honesty, "coverage" is neutral but in context implies scrutiny, and "aggressive" could be seen as pushing boundaries.

So, compiling all these, I list each morally framed word as per the user's instruction.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, ensuring to include as many of these moral words as possible. I'll start by stating Cruz's accusation against Trump, using "lashed out" and "enlisting." Mention the Enquirer's story and Cruz's denial with "garbage." Include the CNN exchange with "accused" and "affair." Trump's denial using "nothing to do with" and "pretend innocence." Finally, note the Enquirer's reputation and their denial of influence, using "infamous," "tabloid journalism," and "deny."

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. I'll structure it to cover all key points without getting bogged down in details, ensuring each moral word is contextually appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**  
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accused Donald Trump of using "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen" to spread false claims about extramarital affairs. The Enquirer published a story alleging Cruz had affairs with five women, which he denied, calling the attacks "garbage." A surreal CNN exchange saw Cruz's former director accused of an affair. Trump denied involvement, claiming he "had absolutely nothing to do with it." The Enquirer, known for its tabloid journalism, has exposed major sex scandals but denied Trump's backers influenced the story. Its parent company stated, "No one influences the reporting... other than our own reporters and editors." Cruz's accusations and the Enquirer's coverage highlight ongoing moral and political tensions.
