SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has denied allegations of extramarital affairs with five women, which were published in the National Enquirer. Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the tabloid to spread false rumors, claiming Trump's "friends" at the Enquirer and "political henchmen" were behind the story. Trump responded, saying he had no involvement with the Enquirer and did not know about the story. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but its parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers. The allegations sparked a heated exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, who accused the director of having an affair with Cruz.
