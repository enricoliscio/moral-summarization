SUMMARY: 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of orchestrating a smear campaign against him. The National Enquirer published a story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women, which Cruz vehemently denied, calling the attacks "garbage." The allegations sparked a surreal exchange on CNN, with one columnist accusing Cruz's former communications director of having an affair with him. Trump responded with a statement denying any involvement, calling Cruz "Lyin' Ted" and suggesting he has a problem with the Enquirer. While the Enquirer has an infamous reputation for tabloid journalism, it has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating they stand by the integrity of their aggressive reporting.
END OF SUMMARY.
