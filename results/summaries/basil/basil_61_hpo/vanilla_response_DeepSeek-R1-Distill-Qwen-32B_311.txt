Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer and his political team to spread rumors about him having affairs with five women. The Enquirer published this story, and Cruz denied it, calling the attacks garbage. There was a CNN exchange where someone accused Cruz's former director of having an affair with him, which seems to be part of the fallout.

Then, Trump responded, saying he had nothing to do with the Enquirer story and criticized Cruz for surrounding himself with political hacks. The Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump's team, stating they handle their own reporting.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Cruz's accusation against Trump, the Enquirer's story, Cruz's denial, the CNN incident, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's statement. I'll make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all key points without getting too detailed.
