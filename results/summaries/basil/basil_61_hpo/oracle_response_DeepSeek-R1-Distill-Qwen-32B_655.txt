Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The key morally framed words are "affairs," "scandals," and "influenced." I'll start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer and political henchmen to spread rumors about him having affairs with five women. Cruz denied these allegations, calling them garbage. There was a CNN exchange where someone accused Cruz's former director of having an affair with him. Trump denied any involvement, saying he didn't know about the story and criticized Cruz for surrounding himself with political hacks. The Enquirer's parent company also denied being influenced by Trump's backers, stating their reporters and editors handle the stories independently.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words. So, I'll mention the affairs, scandals, and influenced. I should structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Cruz's accusation, mention the affairs and scandals, then Trump's denial and criticism, and finally the Enquirer's response about not being influenced. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing.
