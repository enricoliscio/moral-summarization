SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using his connections with the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, in which Cohen accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz, added to the surreal nature of the situation. While Trump denied any involvement, claiming he had "nothing to do" with the Enquirer, the tabloid has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of former Sen. John Edwards and golfer Tiger Woods. The Enquirer's parent company also denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporters and editors maintain the integrity of their coverage. This incident highlights the ethical and moral implications of using personal attacks and smear campaigns in political discourse, raising questions about the boundaries of acceptable behavior in politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
