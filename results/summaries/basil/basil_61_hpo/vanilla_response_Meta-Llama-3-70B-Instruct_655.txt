SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread rumors about him, including a story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." Trump responded, saying he had no involvement with the story and didn't know about it until it was published. The National Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of John Edwards and Tiger Woods. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied that Trump backers influenced the story, saying the publication's reporting is independent. The allegations led to a heated exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, with the columnist accusing the director of having an affair with Cruz.
