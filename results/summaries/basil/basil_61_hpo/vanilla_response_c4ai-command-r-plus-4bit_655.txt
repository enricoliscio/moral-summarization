SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, who accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz, added to the surreal nature of the situation. Trump denied any involvement, claiming he had nothing to do with the story and that Cruz's problem was his alone. The Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporters and editors have integrity and are committed to aggressive reporting.
END OF SUMMARY.
