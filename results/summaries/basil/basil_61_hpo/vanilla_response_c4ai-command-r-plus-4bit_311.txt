SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, who accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz, added to the surreal nature of the situation. Trump denied any involvement with the Enquirer story, stating he had "nothing to do" with the publication. While the Enquirer is known for tabloid journalism, it has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporting is driven by their own reporters and editors.
