SUMMARY: 
Senator Ted Cruz lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of using the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz's alleged extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling them "garbage." The allegations sparked an almost surreal exchange on CNN, where Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen accused Cruz's former communications director, Amanda Carpenter, of having an affair with Cruz. Trump denied any involvement in the story, stating that he had "nothing to do with the National Enquirer." While the Enquirer is known for tabloid journalism, it has also broken major sex scandals in the past. Cruz's team denied the influence of Trump backers on the story, standing by the integrity of their reporting. The moral framing of this news article revolves around the words "lash," "accusing," "vehemently," "rippling," "garbage," "exchange," "affair," "henchmen," "lied," "pretend innocence," "problem," "hope," "right," and "hacks," highlighting the perceived immoral actions and intentions of both Cruz and Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
