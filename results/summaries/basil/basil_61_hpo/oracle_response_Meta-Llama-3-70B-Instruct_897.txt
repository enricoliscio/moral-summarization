SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) vehemently denied allegations of extramarital affairs with five women, published by the National Enquirer, calling the attacks "garbage". Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the tabloid and his "political henchmen" to discredit him. Trump responded, claiming he had no involvement with the Enquirer and no knowledge of the story, but hinted that Cruz's problem with the tabloid was his own doing. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of former Sen. John Edwards and golfer Tiger Woods. The tabloid's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporting is driven by their own reporters and editors. The controversy has sparked a heated exchange between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, with accusations flying back and forth. The integrity of the Enquirer's coverage remains a point of contention.
