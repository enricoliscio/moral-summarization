Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

So, Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer and his political team to spread false stories about him. The Enquirer published a story claiming Cruz had affairs with five women, which he denied. There was a heated exchange on CNN where someone accused Cruz's former director of an affair. Trump denied involvement, calling Cruz a liar and saying the story was Cruz's problem. The Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump's side.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects. The article implies that Trump is using tabloids to attack opponents, which is a negative moral action. Cruz is portrayed as the victim, but also as someone who's denying the allegations. The Enquirer's credibility is in question because they've exposed other politicians, but now they're being accused of being influenced by Trump.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Cruz and Trump, the false allegations, and the moral implications of using tabloids for political attacks. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me start by mentioning Cruz's accusation against Trump, the Enquirer's story, Cruz's denial, the CNN exchange, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's denial of influence. I'll make sure to include the moral framing by emphasizing the use of tabloids and false information in politics.

I should also note that the Enquirer has a history of exposing other politicians, adding context to their credibility. This adds to the moral aspect of whether using such outlets is justified.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points succinctly. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds value and maintains the moral perspective.
