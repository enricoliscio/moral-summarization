SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of using "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding" after the tabloid published a story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the "garbage" rumors, which rippled through the Washington media establishment. Trump responded, saying he had "absolutely nothing to do with it" and that Cruz's problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone. Trump also took a jab at Cruz, calling him "Lyin' Ted Cruz" and saying he doesn't surround himself with "political hacks and henchman" like Cruz does. The National Enquirer has a reputation for breaking major sex scandals, but its parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, standing by the "integrity" of their coverage.
