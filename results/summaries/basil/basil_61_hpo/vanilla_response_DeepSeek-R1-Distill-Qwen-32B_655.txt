Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Sen. Ted Cruz lashing out at Donald Trump. He accused Trump of using the National Enquirer and his political team to spread rumors. The Enquirer published a story claiming Cruz had affairs with five women, which Cruz denied. He called the attacks "garbage" in a Facebook statement.

Then, there was an exchange on CNN where someone accused Cruz's former director of having an affair with him. Trump responded, saying he had nothing to do with the story and criticized Cruz for surrounding himself with political hacks. Trump also mentioned the Enquirer's track record, like exposing John Edwards and Tiger Woods.

The Enquirer's parent company denied any influence from Trump's backers, saying their reporters and editors handle the stories.

So, the key points are:
- Cruz accuses Trump of using the Enquirer and his team to spread false stories.
- The Enquirer published false claims about Cruz's affairs.
- Cruz denied the allegations.
- Trump denied involvement and criticized Cruz.
- The Enquirer defended their reporting integrity.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include all main points without getting too detailed. Maybe mention the tabloid's reputation and the parent company's response briefly.

Let me structure it: Start with Cruz's accusation, mention the Enquirer's story, Cruz's denial, the CNN exchange, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's defense.

I think that covers everything without going over the word limit. Let me put it together concisely.
