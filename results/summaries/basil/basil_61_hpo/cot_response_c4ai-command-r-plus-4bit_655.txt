SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of enlisting "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen" to spread rumors of Cruz's extramarital affairs. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage" and rippling through the Washington media. He accused Trump of surrounding himself with political hacks and pretending innocence. Trump denied any involvement with the story, stating he had "nothing to do with the National Enquirer." Cruz's former communications director, Amanda Carpenter, was also accused of an affair with Cruz by Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen. The National Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has broken major sex scandals in the past. The Enquirer's parent company denied any influence from Trump backers, standing by the integrity of their reporting. Cruz's statement highlighted his moral stance against Trump's alleged underhanded tactics, expressing hope that the allegations were untrue.
