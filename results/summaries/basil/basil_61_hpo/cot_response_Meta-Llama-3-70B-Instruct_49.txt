SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding" after the tabloid published a story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the "garbage" rumors, which rippled through the Washington media establishment. Trump responded, denying any involvement with the National Enquirer and implying that Cruz surrounds himself with "political hacks and henchman" and then pretends "total innocence". The Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that "no one influences the reporting that The National Enquirer does other than our own reporters and editors" and that they stand by the "integrity" of their coverage. The allegations have sparked a heated exchange, with Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter being accused of having an affair with Cruz.
END OF SUMMARY.
