SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of enlisting the National Enquirer to spread rumors of Cruz's extramarital affairs with five women, which Cruz vehemently denied. The exchange highlighted the questionable ethics and morality of both parties involved, with Cruz accusing Trump of using his wealth and influence to attack his character and reputation, and Trump denying any involvement while simultaneously insulting Cruz. The National Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, but the exchange between Cruz and Trump underscores the problematic nature of using personal attacks and potentially false allegations as political weapons. It raises serious ethical concerns about the role of wealth, power, and media manipulation in politics and the potential harm caused by such tactics. 

END OF SUMMARY.
