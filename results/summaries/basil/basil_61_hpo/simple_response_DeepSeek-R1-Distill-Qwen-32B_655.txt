Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that claims Cruz had affairs. Cruz denies the allegations and calls them garbage. There's a CNN exchange where someone accuses his former director of an affair. Trump denies involvement, saying he's innocent and accuses Cruz of lying. The Enquirer's parent company also denies any influence from Trump's people.

I should highlight the key points: Cruz's accusation, the denial, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's stance. I need to keep the moral tone, showing Cruz's anger and Trump's counter-accusations.

Let me structure the summary. Start with Cruz's accusation, then his denial. Mention the CNN incident briefly. Then Trump's response, emphasizing his denial and the counter-accusation. Finally, the Enquirer's denial. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Make sure to include the moral elements like the attack on Cruz's integrity and Trump's defense against being involved. Also, note the Enquirer's reputation and their denial of influence.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, ensuring the summary reflects the original's framing.
