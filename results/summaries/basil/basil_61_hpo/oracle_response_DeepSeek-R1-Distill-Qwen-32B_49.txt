Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific instructions to include the words "affairs," "scandals," and "influenced." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Sen. Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false allegations about him having affairs. The article mentions the Enquirer's reputation for scandals and Trump denying any involvement.

Next, I need to identify the key elements: Cruz's denial, the Enquirer's story, Trump's response, and the parent company's statement. I should make sure to include the morally framed words naturally in the summary.

I'll start by stating Cruz's accusation, then mention the Enquirer's story and his denial. I'll include the word "affairs" there. Then, I'll note Trump's denial and the word "influenced." I should also touch on the Enquirer's history with scandals, using that word. Finally, I'll add the parent company's statement about their integrity.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it's concise. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Cruz's accusation, the story details, Trump's response, and the company's denial. This should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the moral framing.

Let me draft it out, making sure each sentence includes the required words where appropriate. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure clarity and that all key points are included without any unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accused Donald Trump of enlisting "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen" to spread false claims of extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The National Enquirer, known for its tabloid journalism, has previously broken major scandals, including those involving John Edwards and Tiger Woods. Trump denied any involvement, stating he had "nothing to do" with the story. The Enquirer's parent company also denied being influenced by Trump backers, emphasizing their reporting integrity. Cruz's claims of affairs and the Enquirer's history of scandals highlight the moral framing of the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
