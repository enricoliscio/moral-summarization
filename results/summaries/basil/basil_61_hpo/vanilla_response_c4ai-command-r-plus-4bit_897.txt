SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange spilled over into a CNN debate between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, with Cohen accusing Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz. Trump denied any involvement with the National Enquirer story but questioned Cruz's integrity. The Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied any influence from Trump backers on the story.
