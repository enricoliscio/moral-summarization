SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to smear him with false allegations of extramarital affairs. The tabloid published a story claiming Cruz had affairs with five women, which he vehemently denied. Cruz stated that the attacks are "garbage" and accused Trump of using his friends at the National Enquirer and political henchmen to do his bidding. Trump responded, denying any involvement with the story and saying he had not read it. The National Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but its parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers. The allegations led to a surreal exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, with the columnist accusing the director of having an affair with Cruz.
