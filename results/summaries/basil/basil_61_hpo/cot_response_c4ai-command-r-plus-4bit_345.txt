SUMMARY: 
Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that claimed he had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling them "garbage" and accusing Trump of enlisting "henchmen" to do his bidding. The story, which rippled through the media, included a surreal exchange on CNN where Cruz's former communications director was accused of having an affair with him. Trump denied any involvement, calling Cruz "Lyin' Ted" and saying he hopes the Enquirer is not right about him. While the Enquirer has an infamous reputation, it has broken major sex scandals and stood by the integrity of its aggressive reporting. A spokesman for the publication's parent company denied any influence from Trump backers. 
END OF SUMMARY.
