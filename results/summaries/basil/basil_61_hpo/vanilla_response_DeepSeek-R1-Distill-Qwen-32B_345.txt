Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and the National Enquirer. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article starts with Sen. Ted Cruz criticizing Donald Trump. He accuses Trump of using friends at the National Enquirer and political henchmen. The Enquirer published a story claiming Cruz had affairs with five women, which Cruz denies. He called the attacks "garbage."

Then, there's an exchange on CNN where Cruz's former director was accused of having an affair with him. Trump responded, saying he had nothing to do with the story and criticized Cruz for surrounding himself with political hacks. Trump also mentioned that the Enquirer had been right about other figures like O.J. Simpson and John Edwards, hoping they're wrong about Cruz.

The article also mentions the Enquirer's reputation for tabloid journalism but notes they've broken major sex scandals before. The Enquirer's parent company denied any influence from Trump backers, stating their reporters and editors handle the stories independently.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Cruz's accusations against Trump, the Enquirer's story, Cruz's denial, the CNN exchange, Trump's response, the Enquirer's reputation, and their denial of influence.

I'll start by stating Cruz's accusation, mention the Enquirer's story and his denial. Then, include the CNN incident briefly. Next, Trump's response, his denial of involvement, and the comparison. Finally, the Enquirer's reputation and their statement about independence.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all key points are covered without being too verbose.
