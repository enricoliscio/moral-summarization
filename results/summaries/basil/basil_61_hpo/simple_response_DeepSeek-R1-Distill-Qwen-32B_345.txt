Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to attack him with false stories about affairs. The article also mentions the Enquirer's history of breaking major scandals, and Trump denying any involvement.

Okay, the key points are Cruz's accusation, the Enquirer's story, Cruz's denial, the CNN exchange, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's statement. I need to highlight the moral aspects, like Cruz calling the attacks "garbage" and Trump's denial of involvement, emphasizing the integrity of the Enquirer's reporting.

I should structure the summary to include all these points concisely. Make sure to mention the tabloid's reputation and the denial from both Trump and the Enquirer. Keep it under 200 words, using clear and concise language while maintaining the moral tone from the original text.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs with five women, calling the attacks "garbage." Cruz denied the claims, which sparked a surreal CNN exchange where a columnist accused his former communications director, Amanda Carpenter, of having an affair with him. Trump denied involvement, stating he had "nothing to do" with the story and criticized Cruz for surrounding himself with "political hacks." The Enquirer, known for breaking major sex scandals, defended its reporting, claiming it was not influenced by Trump backers. Cruz's allegations highlight a clash of morality and media integrity in the political arena. END OF SUMMARY.
