SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using his connections with the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about Cruz's personal life, including allegations of extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the "garbage" rumors, which sparked a heated exchange on CNN between his former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist. Trump responded by distancing himself from the Enquirer's story, claiming he had no involvement and had not even read it. However, Trump couldn't resist taking a jab at Cruz, saying he didn't surround himself with "political hacks and henchmen" like Cruz did. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of John Edwards and Tiger Woods. The tabloid's parent company denied that Trump backers had influenced the story, standing by the integrity of their reporting.
