SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas accused Donald Trump of being behind a recent National Enquirer story that claimed Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, in which Cohen accused Carpenter of being involved with Cruz, added to the surreal nature of the situation. Trump denied any involvement, claiming he had "nothing to do with the National Enquirer." While the Enquirer is known for tabloid journalism, it has also broken major sex scandals in the past, such as the affairs of former Sen. John Edwards and golfer Tiger Woods. The Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporters and editors have integrity in their aggressive reporting on such topics.
END OF SUMMARY.
