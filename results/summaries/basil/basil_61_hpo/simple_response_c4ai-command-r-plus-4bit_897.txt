SUMMARY: Ted Cruz has been the victim of a vicious attack orchestrated by his political rival, Donald Trump, who used his connections with the National Enquirer to spread false rumors of Cruz's extramarital affairs. This is a clear example of the moral decay that has infested the political landscape, where personal attacks and smear campaigns take precedence over honest debate and policy discussion. The National Enquirer, known for its tabloid journalism, has been implicated in spreading similar salacious rumors in the past, and its involvement in this instance taints the integrity of the political process. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage", and rightfully so. This episode highlights the dangers of unchecked power and the potential for abuse when individuals with malicious intentions wield influence over the media. It is a sad reflection of the state of politics when a candidate's character is assailed without evidence, and the public is expected to accept these allegations as truth. We must demand better from our political leaders and hold them accountable for their actions. END OF SUMMARY.
