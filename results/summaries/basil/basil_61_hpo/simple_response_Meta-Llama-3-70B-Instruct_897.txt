SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about him, including allegations of extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling them "garbage." Trump responded by denying any involvement with the Enquirer and shifting the blame to Cruz, saying his problem with the tabloid is his own. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but its parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers. The allegations sparked a heated exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, who accused her of having an affair with Cruz. The incident highlights the dirty politics and character assassination that can occur in the pursuit of power. It also raises questions about the integrity of certain media outlets and the ease with which false information can spread.
