SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that claimed he had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage". The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, added a layer of surrealism to the situation, with Cohen accusing Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz. Trump denied any involvement in the story, claiming he had nothing to do with the National Enquirer and that Cruz's problems were of his own making. The Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump backers on the story. This incident highlights the moral character, or lack thereof, of those involved, with Cruz taking the moral high ground in denying the allegations and calling out Trump's underhanded tactics, while Trump's response demonstrates a lack of ethical concern and a willingness to engage in smear campaigns.
END OF SUMMARY.
