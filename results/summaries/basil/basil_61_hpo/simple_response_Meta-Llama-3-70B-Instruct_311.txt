SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using his connections with the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about Cruz having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." Trump responded by claiming he had no involvement with the Enquirer and no knowledge of the story, while also taking a jab at Cruz's integrity. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but its parent company denied any external influence on the reporting. This incident highlights the dirty tactics being used in the political arena, where personal attacks and false accusations are being employed to discredit opponents. It is a stark reminder of the importance of integrity and honesty in politics, and the need for leaders to rise above such petty and malicious behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
