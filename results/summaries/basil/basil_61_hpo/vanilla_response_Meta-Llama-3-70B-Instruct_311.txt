SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about him having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The tabloid story sparked a heated exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, who accused her of having an affair with Cruz. Trump responded, denying any involvement with the National Enquirer and claiming he had not read the story. He also took a jab at Cruz, saying he surrounds himself with "political hacks and henchmen." The Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporters and editors are the only ones who influence their coverage.
