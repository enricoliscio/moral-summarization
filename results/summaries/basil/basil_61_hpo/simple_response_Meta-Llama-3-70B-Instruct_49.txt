SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about him having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." Trump responded, claiming he had no involvement with the tabloid and that Cruz's problem with the Enquirer is his own. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but its parent company denied any outside influence on the story. This exchange highlights the dirty politics and character assassination that can occur during elections. It also raises questions about the integrity of certain media outlets and the willingness of politicians to engage in mudslinging. The moral of the story is that honesty and integrity are essential in politics, and that spreading false information and engaging in personal attacks can have serious consequences.

END OF SUMMARY.
