Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used specific morally charged words: affairs, scandals, influenced. So, I should make sure to include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false stories about his affairs. The Enquirer published a story claiming Cruz had affairs with five women, which he denied. There was a heated exchange on CNN where someone accused Cruz's former director of having an affair with him. Trump denied involvement, saying he didn't know about the story and criticized Cruz. The Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump's people.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Cruz's accusation, mention the affairs story, his denial, the CNN exchange, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's denial. I'll make sure to use the words affairs, scandals, influenced as they were in the original text.

I should structure it clearly, perhaps starting with Cruz's accusation, then the story details, the denial, the CNN incident, Trump's denial, and the Enquirer's response. I need to keep it concise but include all key points and the moral framing words.

Let me draft that: Ted Cruz accused Trump of using the Enquirer for affairs story, which Cruz denied. CNN had an exchange where someone accused Cruz's director of affairs. Trump denied involvement, criticized Cruz, and the Enquirer denied influence. Make sure to include scandals and influenced.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral terms. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200.
