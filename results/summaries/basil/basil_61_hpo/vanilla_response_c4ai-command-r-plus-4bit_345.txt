SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz having extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen added to the surreal nature of the situation. Trump denied any involvement, stating he had nothing to do with the National Enquirer and that Cruz's problem was his alone. The Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has also broken major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump backers on the story.
END OF SUMMARY.
