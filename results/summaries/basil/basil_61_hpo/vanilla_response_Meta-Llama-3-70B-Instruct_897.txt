SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has denied allegations of extramarital affairs with five women, published by the National Enquirer. Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the tabloid to discredit him, but Trump denied any involvement. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of former Sen. John Edwards and golfer Tiger Woods. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied that Trump backers influenced the story, stating that the publication's reporting is independent and committed to aggressive coverage of important topics. The allegations sparked a heated exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist, who accused the director of having an affair with Cruz. Trump responded to Cruz's accusations, saying he had no knowledge of the story and did not surround himself with "political hacks and henchmen."
