Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used specific morally charged words: affairs, scandals, influenced. I should make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false stories about his affairs. The Enquirer published a story claiming Cruz had affairs with five women, which he denied. There was a heated exchange on CNN where Cruz's former director was accused too. Trump denied any involvement, and the Enquirer's parent company also denied being influenced by Trump's people.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Cruz's accusation, mention the affairs story, his denial, the CNN exchange, Trump's response, and the Enquirer's denial. I'll make sure to include the words "affairs," "scandals," and "influenced" as per the user's request.

I should also keep the moral tone intact, highlighting the accusations and denials without bias. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and make sure the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accused Donald Trump of using "friends at the National Enquirer" to spread false claims of extramarital affairs involving five women. Cruz denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The National Enquirer, known for tabloid journalism, has previously exposed sex scandals involving figures like John Edwards and Tiger Woods. Trump denied involvement, stating he had "nothing to do" with the story. A spokesperson for the Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump backers, emphasizing their editorial independence. The exchange on CNN, where Cruz's former communications director was accused of an affair, added to the surreal nature of the unfolding scandal. Cruz's accusations and Trump's denials highlight the ongoing tension between the two figures, with Cruz framing Trump as manipulative and Trump dismissing Cruz as dishonest. END OF SUMMARY.
