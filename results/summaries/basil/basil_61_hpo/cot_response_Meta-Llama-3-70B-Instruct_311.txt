SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of using "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding" after the tabloid published a story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the "garbage" rumors, which sparked a heated exchange on CNN. Trump responded, saying he had "absolutely nothing to do" with the story and that Cruz's problem with the National Enquirer was his own. The Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, saying they stand by the "integrity" of their coverage. The tabloid has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but Cruz called the allegations "attacks" and maintained his "innocence". The controversy has raised questions about the role of "hacks" and "lyin'" in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
