SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of enlisting the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz's extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, who accused Carpenter of being named in the Enquirer story, added to the surreal nature of the situation. Trump denied any involvement, claiming he had "nothing to do with the National Enquirer." While the Enquirer is known for tabloid journalism, it has also broken major sex scandals, such as those involving former Sen. John Edwards and golfer Tiger Woods. The Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporters and editors have integrity in their aggressive reporting on such topics.
END OF SUMMARY.
