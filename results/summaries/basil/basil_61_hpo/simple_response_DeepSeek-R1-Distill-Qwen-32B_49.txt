Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and the National Enquirer. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about Ted Cruz accusing Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false stories about him. Cruz denies the affairs mentioned in the article. There's also a mention of a surreal exchange on CNN where someone accused Cruz's former director of an affair. Trump denies any involvement and criticizes Cruz. The Enquirer's parent company claims they're independent.

Now, the moral framing here seems to involve issues of truthfulness, manipulation, and media integrity. Cruz is portrayed as being attacked unfairly, while Trump is accused of underhanded tactics. The Enquirer's credibility is also in question because of their history.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to highlight these moral aspects. I should mention Cruz's accusations, Trump's denial, the Enquirer's response, and the broader implications of media ethics.

I should structure it by first stating Cruz's accusations, then Trump's response, followed by the Enquirer's denial, and conclude with the ethical implications. Keeping it concise but covering all the main points without losing the moral angle is key.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll make sure to include all the necessary elements without getting bogged down in details. Once done, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.
