SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using his connections with the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about Cruz's personal life, including allegations of extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the "garbage" accusations, which sparked a heated exchange between his former communications director and a Boston Herald columnist. Trump responded by distancing himself from the scandal, claiming he had no involvement with the National Enquirer and implying that Cruz was guilty of surrounding himself with "political hacks and henchmen". The Enquirer, known for its tabloid journalism, has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of John Edwards and Tiger Woods. The publication's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, standing by the integrity of their coverage. The controversy has rippled through the Washington media establishment, with Cruz's reputation on the line.
