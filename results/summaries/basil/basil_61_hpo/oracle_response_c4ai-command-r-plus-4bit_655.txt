SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that claimed he had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, who accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz, further fueled the fire. Trump denied any involvement in the story, claiming he had "nothing to do with the National Enquirer." While the Enquirer is known for tabloid journalism, it has also broken major sex scandal stories, such as the affairs of former Sen. John Edwards and golfer Tiger Woods. The Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, stating that their reporters and editors have integrity in their aggressive reporting on such topics.
END OF SUMMARY.
