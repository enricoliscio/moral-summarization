SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) vehemently denied allegations of extramarital affairs with five women, calling the rumors "garbage" and accusing Donald Trump of enlisting "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding." Trump responded, claiming he had no involvement with the tabloid and implying that Cruz surrounds himself with "hacks" and "henchmen." The National Enquirer, known for its "infamous" reputation, has broken major sex scandals in the past, but a spokesman denied that Trump backers influenced the story, citing the publication's "integrity." Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter was also drawn into the controversy, with a Boston Herald columnist accusing her of having an affair with Cruz. The allegations have sparked a heated exchange between the two presidential candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
