SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to spread false rumors about him, including allegations of extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling them "garbage." Trump responded, claiming he had no involvement with the tabloid and no knowledge of the story. The National Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, but its reputation for tabloid journalism is also well-known. The publication's parent company denied any outside influence on their reporting, standing by the integrity of their coverage.

The moral framing of this story is clear: Ted Cruz is portrayed as a victim of dirty politics, while Donald Trump is accused of using underhanded tactics to discredit his opponent. The National Enquirer's reputation is also called into question, with its history of breaking scandals conflicting with its tabloid nature. Ultimately, the story raises concerns about the ethics of political mudslinging and the role of the media in shaping public opinion.

END OF SUMMARY.
