SUMMARY:
Senator Ted Cruz lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of enlisting the National Enquirer to spread rumors about Cruz's alleged extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, calling the allegations "garbage." The situation escalated with an exchange on CNN, where Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen accused Cruz's former communications director, Amanda Carpenter, of having an affair with Cruz. The National Enquirer, known for its tabloid journalism, has also broken major sex scandals in the past. While Trump denied any involvement, Cruz countered by saying that Trump surrounds himself with political henchmen and pretends innocence. The Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., defended its reporting integrity, denying any outside influence on their aggressive coverage of such topics. This incident highlights the moral dilemmas and ethical boundaries in political journalism and the impact of personal attacks on public figures.
