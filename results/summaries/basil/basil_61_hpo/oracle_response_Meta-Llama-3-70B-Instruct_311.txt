SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of using "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding" after the tabloid published a story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the "garbage" rumors, which sparked a heated exchange on CNN. Trump responded, denying any involvement with the National Enquirer and stating that Cruz's problem with the tabloid is his alone. The Enquirer has a history of breaking major sex scandals, including those of John Edwards and Tiger Woods. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, standing by the integrity of their coverage.

The morally framed words "affairs", "scandals", and "influenced" highlight the questionable ethics involved in this situation, suggesting that Trump and the National Enquirer may have engaged in unscrupulous behavior to discredit Cruz. The denial of involvement by Trump and the Enquirer only adds to the controversy, leaving the public to wonder about the truth behind these allegations.

END OF SUMMARY.
