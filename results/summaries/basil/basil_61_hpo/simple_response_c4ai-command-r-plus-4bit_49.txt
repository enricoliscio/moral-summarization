SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of employing immoral tactics in their political battle by enlisting the help of the National Enquirer to spread rumors of Cruz's alleged extramarital affairs. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The exchange between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, added a surreal layer to the situation. Trump denied any involvement with the National Enquirer's story, shifting the blame onto Cruz for surrounding himself with "political hacks and henchman." The Enquirer has a notorious reputation for tabloid journalism but has also exposed major sex scandals in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied any influence from Trump backers on the story. This incident highlights the questionable ethics and morality of using personal attacks and potentially false allegations as political weapons.

END OF SUMMARY.
