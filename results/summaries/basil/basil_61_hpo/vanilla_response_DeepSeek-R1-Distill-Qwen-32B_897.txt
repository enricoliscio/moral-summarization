Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of using the National Enquirer to attack him. There's a lot here, so I need to break it down.

First, I should identify the main points. Ted Cruz is denying the affair allegations from the Enquirer. He's calling out Trump, saying he's behind it. Trump denies any involvement, even though he's calling Cruz a liar. The Enquirer's parent company also says they're independent. The article mentions past scandals they've covered, like John Edwards and Tiger Woods.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include who is involved, the accusations, denials, and the context of the Enquirer's reputation. Maybe mention the surreal exchange on CNN as it adds context to the situation.

Let me structure it: Start with Cruz's accusation against Trump, then Cruz's denial. Mention the Enquirer's response and their past work. Also, include Trump's response where he denies involvement and criticizes Cruz. Keep it clear and to the point without getting too detailed.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Make sure it's under 200 words. Let me count the words as I draft it. Okay, that should do it. I'll end with the required tokens.
