Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Sen. Ted Cruz accusing Donald Trump of being involved with the National Enquirer's story about his alleged affairs. Cruz denied the claims and called them garbage. There was a surreal exchange on CNN where someone accused Cruz's former director of an affair. Trump denied any involvement, saying he had nothing to do with the story. The National Enquirer's parent company also denied any influence from Trump's backers.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with the specified tokens. I need to make sure I capture all the main points: Cruz's accusation, Trump's denial, the Enquirer's response, and the moral implications of using tabloid stories for political attacks.

I should structure the summary to first mention Cruz's accusation, then Trump's denial, followed by the Enquirer's response, and finally touch on the ethical concerns about using such tactics. I'll keep each sentence concise and make sure to include all key details without going over the word limit.

Let me draft it:

"Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging his extramarital affairs, calling the claims 'garbage.' Trump denied involvement, stating he had no prior knowledge of the story. The Enquirer's parent company also refuted any influence from Trump's associates, emphasizing their editorial independence. Cruz's former communications director faced accusations during a CNN segment, adding to the surreal nature of the unfolding scandal. The situation highlights the ethical concerns of using tabloid journalism for political attacks, as the Enquirer has a history of exposing high-profile affairs, including those of John Edwards and Tiger Woods."

I think that covers all the main points and preserves the moral framing by mentioning the ethical concerns. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. It looks good.
