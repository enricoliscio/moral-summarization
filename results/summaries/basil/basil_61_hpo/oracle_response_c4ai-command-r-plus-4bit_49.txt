SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing him of enlisting "his friends" at the National Enquirer to spread rumors of Cruz's extramarital affairs. Cruz vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "garbage." The Enquirer published a story claiming that Cruz had affairs with five women, which Cruz denied in a statement posted on Facebook. The allegations sparked a surreal exchange on CNN, where Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen accused Cruz's former communications director, Amanda Carpenter, of having an affair with Cruz. Trump denied any involvement in the story but questioned Cruz's integrity. The Enquirer has a reputation for tabloid journalism but has also broken major sex scandal stories in the past. A spokesman for the Enquirer's parent company denied that the story was influenced by Trump backers, defending the integrity of their reporting.

END OF SUMMARY.
