SUMMARY: The backlash to Indiana's religious freedom law is growing, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposing a ban on government-funded travel to the state. The law has been criticized for its potential to discriminate against gays and others, with many finding it disturbing that Indiana would embrace such legislation at a time when more states and people are opposing discrimination and embracing civil rights for everyone. The law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which may allow them to refuse service to gay customers, such as a baker denying a wedding cake order from a gay couple. Despite state lawmakers' attempts to clarify the law and defend it as similar to federal legislation passed by then-President Bill Clinton in 1993, the backlash continues. The NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood celebrities have all expressed concern over the law's potential impact on equality and freedom. The situation is especially concerning given the upcoming men's NCAA Final Four basketball championships in Indianapolis, which could lead to significant economic losses for the city. The swift reaction from Washington state leaders and others sends a clear message that discrimination will not be tolerated and that equality is a fundamental value to be embraced, not burdened.
END OF SUMMARY.
