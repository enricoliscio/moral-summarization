Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Indiana's religious freedom law. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about backlash against Indiana's new law. Washington's governor and Seattle's mayor have banned state-funded travel to Indiana. They're concerned the law could allow discrimination against gays. The law is similar to a federal one signed by Clinton, but Indiana's version allows businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to discriminate. State lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, saying it doesn't discriminate, but they might need to adjust the language. Other states are also looking into similar laws. The NCAA and businesses are concerned, and there's a potential boycott affecting the economy, especially with the Final Four basketball event coming up.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the backlash, the actions by Washington and Seattle, the concerns about discrimination, the state's defense, the clarification efforts, other states' actions, and the impact on the economy and events like the Final Four.

I should make sure to include key points: who banned travel, their reasons, the law's potential issues, the state's response, other states' actions, and the economic implications. I'll keep it concise, focusing on the main actions and reactions without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns the law could enable discrimination against gays. Critics argue the law allows businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ individuals, such as a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple. State lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, are clarifying the law, insisting it does not discriminate and aiming to address concerns. Indiana's law differs from similar federal and state laws by explicitly allowing businesses to assert religious rights. Other states are considering similar legislation, while corporate America and Hollywood voice opposition. The NCAA and businesses like Angieâ€™s List are also expressing concern, with potential boycotts affecting Indiana's economy, including the upcoming NCAA Final Four. END OF SUMMARY.
