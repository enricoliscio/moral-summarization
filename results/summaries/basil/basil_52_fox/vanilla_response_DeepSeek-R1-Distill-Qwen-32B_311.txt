Okay, I need to summarize this article about Indiana's religious freedom law. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about backlash against the law, with Washington and Seattle banning state-funded travel. Governors Inslee and Mayor Murray are leading this. They argue that the law could allow discrimination against gays. 

Then, there's the other side: Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Pence defending the law, saying it's similar to federal and other state laws. They mention it's about religious freedom, but it's different because it allows businesses to cite religion as a reason. They plan to clarify the law's language.

Other states are also looking into similar laws. The article mentions Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and others. There's concern about whether businesses can refuse service based on religion. The NCAA and Angie’s List are also worried, with the latter delaying expansion in Indianapolis. 

There's also mention of public figures like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher speaking out against the law. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should structure it to include the backlash, the defense, the impact on other states, and the broader implications. Make sure to highlight the key players and the main concerns. I'll start by stating the backlash, then the defense, followed by the broader state actions, and conclude with the implications and reactions. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns it could enable discrimination against gays. Inslee and Murray argue the law doesn't align with their states' values of equality. Critics fear businesses could refuse services to LGBTQ individuals, such as a baker denying a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, are clarifying the law, stating it doesn't discriminate and aiming to address concerns. Similar legislation is being considered in 15 other states, while corporate leaders and public figures like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher are calling for boycotts. The NCAA and Angie’s List have also expressed concerns, with the latter delaying expansion in Indianapolis. END OF SUMMARY.
