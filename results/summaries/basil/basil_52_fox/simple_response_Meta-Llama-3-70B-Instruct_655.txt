SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could discriminate against gays and others. The law has been defended by state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence, who argue that it does not discriminate and is similar to federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. However, critics argue that the law's language could allow businesses to refuse services to certain individuals, including gay couples. In response to the backlash, state lawmakers are planning to "clarify" the law's language to prevent discrimination. The controversy has sparked boycott threats, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher expressing opposition to the law.
