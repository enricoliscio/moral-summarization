SUMMARY:

The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could lead to discrimination against gays and others. The law has sparked outrage, with critics arguing it could allow businesses to refuse service to certain individuals, including gay couples. Despite claims that the law is similar to federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Indiana's law is seen as more permissive, allowing businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion." State lawmakers and Governor Mike Pence are defending the law, but are also seeking to clarify its language to address concerns. The controversy has sparked boycott threats, with the NCAA, corporate America, and Hollywood figures expressing opposition. The law has been widely criticized as discriminatory and morally repugnant, with many arguing it goes against the principles of equality and fairness.
