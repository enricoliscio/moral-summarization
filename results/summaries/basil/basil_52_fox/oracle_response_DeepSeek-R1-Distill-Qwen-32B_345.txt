Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words they listed, so I need to make sure those are included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Indiana's religious freedom law causing backlash, with Washington and Seattle imposing travel bans. The concern is that the law could allow discrimination against gays. The state lawmakers are trying to clarify the law to prevent this perception.

I should start by identifying the key events: the backlash, the travel bans, the concerns about discrimination, the lawmakers' defense and attempt to clarify, and the broader context of similar laws in other states. 

I need to incorporate the moral terms like "discriminate," "disturbing," "embrace," "oppose," "ban," "discrimination," "refuse," "exercise," "clarify," and "burden." 

I'll structure the summary to first mention the backlash and bans, then the concerns, followed by the lawmakers' defense and clarification efforts. I should also note the broader state context and the impact on businesses and events like the NCAA Final Four.

I have to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll need to be efficient with each sentence. I'll make sure each moral term is used appropriately without forcing them in. 

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all necessary points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY:  
Backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law intensified as Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposed bans on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns it could enable discrimination against gays. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, criticized the law as not reflecting Seattle's values, while Inslee called it "disturbing" and opposed it. Critics fear the law could allow businesses to refuse services to gay residents, such as a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, defended the law, claiming it does not discriminate and aims to "clarify" its language. They emphasized that the law protects the "free exercise of religion" but acknowledged confusion over whether it permits businesses to deny services based on religious beliefs. Meanwhile, 15 other states are considering similar legislation, and corporate leaders, including the NCAA, expressed concern over its potential impact. Boycott threats and calls for clarification have grown, particularly ahead of the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis, which could face financial losses if protests continue. END OF SUMMARY.
