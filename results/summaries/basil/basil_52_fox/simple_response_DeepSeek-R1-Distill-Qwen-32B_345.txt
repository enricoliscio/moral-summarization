Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Indiana's new religious freedom law causing backlash, with some states boycotting travel there. The main issue is that the law might allow businesses to discriminate against gays, like refusing service for a wedding cake. Lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, saying it doesn't discriminate, but there's concern it could let businesses refuse service based on religion. Other states are looking into similar laws, and the NCAA is worried about its events in Indiana. There are also mentions of companies and celebrities opposing the law.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to capture the key points: the backlash, the boycotts by Washington and Seattle, the concerns about discrimination, the lawmakers' defense and attempts to clarify, the comparison to other states, and the impact on events and businesses. I need to keep the moral perspective, highlighting the conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination. I should avoid any markdown and just provide the summary in plain text after "SUMMARY:".

Let me structure this: start with the backlash, mention the boycotts, the concerns about discrimination, the lawmakers' response, other states' actions, the NCAA's concern, and the impact on businesses and events. Keep it concise and within the word limit. Make sure to include that the law allows businesses to assert religious rights, leading to potential discrimination, and the counterarguments from the lawmakers that it's not about discrimination. Also, note the broader implications with other states and the potential economic impact from boycotts.
