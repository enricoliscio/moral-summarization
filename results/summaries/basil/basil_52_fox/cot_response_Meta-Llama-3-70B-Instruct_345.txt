SUMMARY:
The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could lead to discrimination against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it goes against the values of embracing civil rights for everyone. Murray, who is openly gay, said the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents' values of equality and nondiscrimination. Indiana lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, but critics argue it could allow businesses to discriminate against certain groups. The law has sparked outrage, with many calling for boycotts and expressing concern about its potential impact on the NCAA Final Four championships and local businesses. END OF SUMMARY.
