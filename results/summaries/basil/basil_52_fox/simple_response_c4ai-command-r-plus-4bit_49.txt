SUMMARY: Indiana's recently passed religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash and boycott threats, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to the state. The law is perceived to have the potential to discriminate against gays and others by allowing businesses to refuse services to certain groups, such as a baker denying a wedding cake order from a gay couple. Despite defenses and explanations from state lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence, the law is seen as discriminatory and a step backward for civil rights. Similar concerns have been raised by the NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood celebrities, with some companies even halting expansion plans in the state. The backlash highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws, with many arguing that the law's potential for discrimination outweighs its intended purpose. Lawmakers in Indiana are now working to clarify the language of the law to address these concerns and ensure that discrimination is not permitted.
