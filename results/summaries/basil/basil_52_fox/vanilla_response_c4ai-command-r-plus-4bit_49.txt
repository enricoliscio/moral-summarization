SUMMARY: Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked a backlash, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to the state due to concerns over potential discrimination against gays and others. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Mike Pence, allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which could allow them to refuse service to gay customers. State lawmakers are defending the law, similar to a federal law passed by then-President Bill Clinton in 1993, and plan to clarify its language to address concerns. However, the NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood stars have expressed opposition, with some calling for a boycott of the state. The controversy comes as Indianapolis prepares to host the men's NCAA Final Four basketball championships, which could bring significant revenue to the area. The governors of Washington, Connecticut, and New York have also issued similar bans on non-essential travel to Indiana.
END OF SUMMARY.
