SUMMARY: A backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law is growing, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposing a ban on government-funded travel to the state. The law has been criticized for its potential to discriminate against gays and others, with many seeing it as disturbing and a step backward for civil rights. The law's defenders, including state lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence, argue that it does not discriminate and is similar to a federal law passed by then-President Bill Clinton in 1993. However, the Indiana law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which has raised concerns about potential discrimination in the denial of services to certain groups. Lawmakers have stated that they will swiftly clarify the law's language to address these concerns. The NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood celebrities have all expressed opposition to the law, with some threatening boycotts and others putting expansion plans on hold. The controversy highlights the ongoing struggle between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws in the United States.
