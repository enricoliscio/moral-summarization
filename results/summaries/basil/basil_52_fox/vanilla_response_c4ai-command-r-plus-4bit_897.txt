SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have joined the growing backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law, banning government-funded travel to the state. The law, signed by Republican Governor Mike Pence, has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gay residents. While Pence and state lawmakers defend the law, claiming it protects religious freedom, similar concerns have been raised in other states, including Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, and Colorado. The Indiana law differs by allowing businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion." Amid the controversy, the NCAA and corporate figures have expressed concern, with Angie's List halting plans to expand in Indianapolis and actors George Takei and Ashton Kutcher calling for boycotts. Indiana lawmakers plan to clarify the law to address concerns about discrimination, but the damage to the state's reputation and economy may already be significant.
