Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Indiana's religious freedom law causing backlash, with Washington and Seattle imposing travel bans. The law is seen as potentially allowing discrimination against gays. Lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, but there's still confusion.

I need to highlight the moral aspects: discrimination, opposition, imposing bans, etc. I should mention the key players like Inslee and Murray, their actions, and the reactions from the business and entertainment worlds.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start with the backlash, mention the bans, the concerns about discrimination, the lawmakers' attempts to clarify, and the broader implications with other states and the NCAA.

Let me structure it step by step: introduction of the issue, actions taken by Inslee and Murray, their statements, the concerns about discrimination, the legislative response, and the potential impact on businesses and events like the Final Four.

I should also include the morally framed words where appropriate, like 'discriminate,' 'ban,' 'opposing,' etc. I need to ensure the summary captures the conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination values.

Finally, I'll check the word count and make sure all key points are included without exceeding the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law escalated as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposed bans on government-funded travel to the state, citing concerns it could enable discrimination against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and noted it conflicts with the growing embrace of civil rights nationwide. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, echoed this, stating the law doesn't reflect Seattle's values and ordered a review of city contracts with Indiana-based companies. Critics fear the law could allow businesses to refuse services to gay residents, such as a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, defended the law, claiming it doesn't discriminate and aims to "clarify" its language. However, they acknowledged confusion over whether businesses could legally deny services to certain groups. The NCAA and companies like Angieâ€™s List expressed concerns, while celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher called for boycotts. The law has sparked national debate, with 15 other states introducing similar legislation in 2015. END OF SUMMARY.
