SUMMARY:

The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana. The law has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gays and others. Inslee and Murray argue that the law doesn't reflect their states' and city's values of equality and civil rights. Indiana lawmakers and Governor Mike Pence are defending the law, citing similar federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and existing laws in 19 other states. However, the Indiana law differs in allowing businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion." State lawmakers plan to clarify the law's language to address concerns. Meanwhile, other states have introduced similar legislation, and the NCAA, corporate America, and Hollywood figures have expressed opposition to the law.
