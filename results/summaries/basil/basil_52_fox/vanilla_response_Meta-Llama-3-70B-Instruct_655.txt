SUMMARY:

The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana. The law has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gays and others. Inslee and Murray join other cities and states in opposing the law, with Murray also reviewing city contracts to see if Seattle is doing business with Indiana-based companies. Indiana lawmakers are defending the law, citing similar federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, but critics argue that the Indiana law differs in key ways. State lawmakers are now working to clarify the law's language to address concerns that it may permit discrimination. The controversy has sparked widespread opposition, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher speaking out against the law.
