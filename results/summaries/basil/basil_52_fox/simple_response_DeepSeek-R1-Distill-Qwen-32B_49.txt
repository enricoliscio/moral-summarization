Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Indiana's new religious freedom law causing backlash. Governors and mayors are imposing travel bans because they believe the law could allow discrimination against gays. Inslee and Murray are leading the opposition, emphasizing equality and the law not reflecting their values.

On the other side, Indiana lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, saying it's about religious freedom and not discrimination. They mention similar federal and state laws but acknowledge the confusion. Other states are also looking into similar laws, and there's concern about the impact on businesses and events like the NCAA Final Four.

I should highlight the conflict between religious freedom and discrimination, the actions taken by opposing sides, and the broader implications for other states and businesses. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral arguments from both sides are clear.

Let me structure the summary: start with the backlash, mention the travel bans, the moral stance against discrimination, the lawmakers' defense, the clarification efforts, other states' actions, and the potential economic impact. Make sure to include key quotes to show the moral framing.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.

SUMMARY: Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could enable discrimination against gays. Inslee and Murray argue the law contradicts equality principles, with Murray stating, "discrimination has no place in our city." Critics fear businesses could refuse services to LGBTQ individuals, such as a baker denying a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, defend the law, claiming it protects religious freedom and does not discriminate. They aim to clarify the legislation to address concerns. Similar religious freedom laws are being considered in other states, while corporate America and Hollywood voice opposition, with figures like George Takei calling for boycotts. The NCAA and businesses in Indianapolis also express concern over potential economic impacts, including the menâ€™s NCAA Final Four. The debate highlights tensions between religious freedom and anti-discrimination protections. END OF SUMMARY.
