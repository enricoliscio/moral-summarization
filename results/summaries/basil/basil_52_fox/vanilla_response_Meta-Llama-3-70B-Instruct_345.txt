SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana. The law has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gays and others. State lawmakers are now moving to clarify the legislation, with Republican Governor Mike Pence and other officials defending the law. However, critics argue that the law differs from similar federal legislation and policies in other states, allowing businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion." The law has sparked boycott threats, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher expressing opposition. State lawmakers have conceded that the law may need clarification to ensure it does not permit discrimination.
