SUMMARY: There is growing backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposing a ban on government-funded travel to the state. This boycott is in response to concerns that the law discriminates against gays and others by potentially allowing businesses to refuse service to gay residents. Despite state lawmakers' attempts to defend and clarify the legislation, claiming it does not discriminate, there is still confusion and opposition to the law. The primary concern is the potential for businesses to deny services to certain individuals, with even the lawmakers themselves unsure of the law's full implications. This controversy comes just before a major basketball championship in Indianapolis, raising concerns about the potential economic impact of any boycott. The NCAA, Angie's List, and several celebrities have also voiced their opposition to the law, emphasizing the need to embrace equality and impose a burden on discriminatory practices.
