Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Indiana's new religious freedom law causing backlash. The key points are the boycotts from Washington and Seattle, the concerns about discrimination against gays, the state's defense of the law, and the potential economic impact. I should highlight the moral arguments on both sides: the supporters emphasizing religious freedom and the opponents pointing out the risk of discrimination. Also, mention the clarification efforts and the broader context of other states considering similar laws. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspectives are clear.

SUMMARY: Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could enable discrimination against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" at a time when civil rights are being embraced nationwide. Murray emphasized that discrimination has no place in Seattle and ordered a review of city contracts with Indiana-based companies. Critics fear the law could allow businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ individuals, such as a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, defend the law, claiming it does not discriminate and plan to clarify its language. However, they remain unclear on whether businesses could legally deny services to certain groups. The law has drawn national attention, with 15 other states considering similar measures. The NCAA and businesses like Angieâ€™s List have expressed concern, while figures in Hollywood and corporate America, including actor George Takei and Ashton Kutcher, have called for boycotts. The potential economic impact on Indianapolis, especially with the NCAA Final Four approaching, adds urgency to the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
