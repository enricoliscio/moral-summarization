SUMMARY:
The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could lead to discrimination against gays and others. Inslee finds the law "disturbing" and says it doesn't align with the values of "embracing civil rights for everyone." Murray, who is openly gay, says the law doesn't reflect Seattle's values of "equality 101" and has ordered a review of city contracts to see if they're doing business with Indiana-based companies. Despite defenders of the law, including Gov. Mike Pence, claiming it doesn't discriminate, critics argue it could allow businesses to refuse service to certain individuals. The law has sparked outrage, with many calling for boycotts and clarifications. END OF SUMMARY.
