Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Indiana's religious freedom law and the backlash it's receiving. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The law is causing a backlash because people think it allows discrimination against gays. Governors and mayors are banning travel to Indiana. The law's supporters say it's about religious freedom, but critics worry it could let businesses refuse service to gays. Other states are looking into similar laws. The NCAA and businesses are concerned about the implications.

Now, I need to make sure to include the moral words: discriminate, disturbing, embracing, opposing, impose, ban, discrimination, refuse, exercise, clarify, burden. I'll structure the summary to cover the backlash, the actions taken by officials, the arguments from both sides, and the broader context of other states and organizations' reactions.

I'll start by stating the backlash and the moral concerns. Then mention the bans and the reasoning behind them. Next, explain the supporters' stance and the attempts to clarify the law. Finally, touch on the impact on events and other states considering similar laws.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while including all the key moral terms. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY:  
The backlash against Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act intensified as critics argued it could enable discrimination against gays and others. Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposed bans on state-funded travel to Indiana, opposing what they deemed a law that "disturbs" progress toward civil rights. Murray emphasized that discrimination has no place in Seattle, while Inslee criticized the law as "disturbing" at a time when equality is widely embraced. Critics fear the law could allow businesses to refuse service to gay individuals, such as a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, defended the law, claiming it does not discriminate and aims to clarify the "free exercise of religion." However, they acknowledged the need to "clarify" its language to address concerns. The law's potential to burden religious freedom while enabling discrimination has sparked debate, with 15 other states considering similar legislation. The NCAA and businesses like Angieâ€™s List have expressed concerns, while figures like actor George Takei called for a boycott. The controversy looms over the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis, with fears of lost revenue and a broader impact on equality. END OF SUMMARY.
