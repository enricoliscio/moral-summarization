SUMMARY: Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to the state. Critics argue the law could enable discrimination against gays and others, such as refusing services to same-sex couples. Inslee and Murray, who is openly gay, stated their opposition, emphasizing equality and Seattle's values. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, are clarifying the law, denying it allows discrimination. They noted it differs from federal and other state laws by allowing businesses to cite religious freedom. However, concerns remain about potential service denials. Indiana's law has drawn national attention, with 15 other states considering similar legislation. The NCAA and companies like Angieâ€™s List are reviewing the law's impact, while celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher are calling for boycotts. The potential financial repercussions for Indiana's economy, including the NCAA Final Four, are also a concern. END OF SUMMARY.
