SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with critics arguing it could discriminate against gays and others. In response, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned government-funded travel to Indiana, citing the law's potential to discriminate. Murray, who is openly gay, has also ordered city departments to review contracts with Indiana-based companies. Indiana lawmakers and Governor Mike Pence defend the law, claiming it does not discriminate and is similar to federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. However, critics point out that the Indiana law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which could lead to discrimination. The controversy has sparked boycott threats, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher expressing opposition. The moral framing of this issue is clear: discrimination has no place in society, and equality is a fundamental value that must be upheld.
