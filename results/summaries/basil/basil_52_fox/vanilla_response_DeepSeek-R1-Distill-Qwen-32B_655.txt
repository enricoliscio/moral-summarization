Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Indiana's religious freedom law. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about backlash against Indiana's new law, with Washington's governor and Seattle's mayor banning state-funded travel to Indiana. They're concerned the law could allow discrimination against gays. The law allows businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to refuse service, which is causing a lot of controversy.

I need to make sure I include the key points: who is opposing the law, their reasons, the claims by Indiana lawmakers that it's not discriminatory, the comparison to other states, and the potential economic impact from boycotts and events like the NCAA Final Four.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. I'll start by mentioning the backlash, then the specific actions taken by Inslee and Murray, their reasons, the lawmakers' defense, the comparison to federal law, and the attempts to clarify the legislation. Then, I'll note the broader context of other states considering similar laws and the economic implications, including the NCAA's concerns and the business reactions.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the main aspects without getting too detailed. Also, I should end with the required tokens as specified.

SUMMARY:  
Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns the law could enable discrimination against gays. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, called the law "disturbing" and urged a review of city contracts with Indiana-based companies. Critics fear the law allows businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ individuals, such as a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, defend the law, claiming it does not discriminate and aim to clarify its language. They argue it is similar to federal and other state laws, though it uniquely allows businesses to assert religious rights. However, concerns persist over potential legal loopholes for discrimination. The NCAA and Angieâ€™s List have also expressed concerns, with the latter delaying expansion plans in Indianapolis. Actor George Takei and others are calling for boycotts, while Indiana officials face pressure to address the law's implications before major events like the NCAA Final Four. END OF SUMMARY.
