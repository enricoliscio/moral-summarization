SUMMARY: Indiana passes a law that legalizes discrimination against gays and others in the name of religious freedom. Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, among others, are taking a stand against the law by banning government-funded travel to Indiana. This boycott is based on moral grounds, prioritizing equality and opposing discrimination. Despite claims that the law does not discriminate, it is unclear whether businesses will now be legally allowed to deny services to certain people, and many are concerned about the potential for harm and discrimination. The NCAA, Angie's List, and actors George Takei and Ashton Kutcher have also expressed their opposition to the law. This situation highlights the ongoing struggle between religious freedom and equality, with many taking a moral stand against discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
