SUMMARY:

The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could discriminate against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it doesn't align with the values of embracing civil rights for everyone. Murray, who is openly gay, said the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents' values and is a form of "discrimination 101." The law has sparked outrage, with many arguing it could allow businesses to refuse service to certain individuals, including gay couples. Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence are defending the law, claiming it doesn't discriminate, but are willing to "clarify" its language to address concerns. Despite their efforts, the law has been met with widespread opposition, with many calling for boycotts and expressing outrage over its potential to burden individuals and perpetuate discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
