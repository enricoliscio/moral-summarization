SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have joined the growing backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law, banning government-funded travel to the state. The law, signed by Republican Governor Mike Pence, has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gay residents. While state lawmakers defend the law, similar to a federal law passed in 1993, they plan to clarify its language to address concerns. 15 other states have introduced similar legislation this year, but Indiana's law differs by allowing businesses to assert religious freedom. The NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher have also voiced opposition, with potential economic impacts on Indianapolis businesses. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about LGBT rights and religious freedom in the US.
