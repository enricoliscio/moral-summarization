Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about Indiana's new religious freedom law causing backlash. Governors and mayors are imposing bans on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns about discrimination against gays. The law allows businesses to refuse services based on religious beliefs, which is seen as disturbing. The author uses words like "discriminate," "ban," and "opposing."

I should start by mentioning the backlash and the bans. Then, include the concerns about discrimination and the business examples, like the baker refusing a wedding cake. It's important to note the state lawmakers' defense, using "clarify" and "burden." Also, mention other states considering similar laws and the impact on events like the NCAA Final Four.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include as many of the specified moral words as possible. Let me structure it step by step: introduce the backlash, explain the bans, describe the concerns, mention the lawmakers' response, and touch on the broader implications and reactions from other entities.

I should make sure to use words like "discriminate," "ban," "opposing," "impose," "discrimination," "refuse," "exercise," "clarify," and "burden." Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The backlash against Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act intensified as Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposed bans on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could enable discrimination against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing," while Murray stated it doesn't align with Seattle's values of equality. Critics fear the law could allow businesses to refuse services to gay individuals, such as a baker denying a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, have defended the law, claiming it doesn't discriminate and will be "clarified" to prevent such outcomes. They argue the law is similar to federal and state legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. However, the Indiana law uniquely allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion." Despite this, concerns persist that it could legally permit discrimination. Meanwhile, 15 other states are considering similar laws, and corporate America, Hollywood, and the NCAA have expressed opposition, with some threatening boycotts and others delaying expansions in Indiana. END OF SUMMARY.
