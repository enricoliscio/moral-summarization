SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could discriminate against gays and others. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, finds the law "disturbing" and contrary to Seattle's values of equality. Inslee has imposed an administration-wide ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, joining other states and cities in opposing the law. The primary concern is that the law might allow businesses to discriminate against gay residents, such as a baker refusing to serve a gay couple. State lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence are defending the law, but critics argue it differs from similar federal legislation and could lead to discrimination. In response, lawmakers plan to clarify the law's language to prevent discrimination. Meanwhile, other states are introducing similar legislation, sparking concerns about a broader trend of discrimination.
