SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with critics arguing it could lead to discrimination against gays and others. Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned government-funded travel to Indiana, citing the law's potential to undermine civil rights. Murray has also ordered city departments to review contracts with Indiana-based companies. Defenders of the law, including Governor Mike Pence and state lawmakers, claim it merely mirrors federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. However, critics point out that Indiana's law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," potentially permitting discrimination. As boycott threats mount, state lawmakers are scrambling to clarify the law's language. The NCAA, corporate America, and Hollywood figures have expressed opposition, with some calling for a boycott. The moral imperative is clear: discrimination has no place in our society, and equality is a fundamental right.
