SUMMARY:
The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana. Inslee finds the law "disturbing" and says it goes against the trend of "embracing civil rights for everyone." Murray, an openly gay Democrat, says the law doesn't reflect Seattle's values of "equality 101" and has ordered a review of city contracts to see if they do business with Indiana-based companies. The law has sparked concerns that it could allow businesses to "discriminate" against gay residents, and state lawmakers are trying to "clarify" its language. However, critics like actor George Takei are calling for a boycott, with Takei expressing "outrage" over the law. The NCAA has also expressed concern about the law's potential impact on its events and workforce. END OF SUMMARY.
