SUMMARY:

The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could discriminate against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it doesn't align with the values of embracing civil rights for everyone. Murray, who is openly gay, said the law doesn't reflect Seattle's values of equality and that discrimination has no place in the city. Indiana lawmakers are defending the law, but critics argue it could allow businesses to refuse service to certain individuals, including gay couples. Lawmakers are now trying to "clarify" the law's language to address concerns that it could lead to discrimination. Meanwhile, other states are introducing similar legislation, sparking concerns about the potential for widespread discrimination. The NCAA, corporate America, and Hollywood figures are also speaking out against the law, with some calling for boycotts.
