SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked a backlash, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could discriminate against gays and others. The law has been defended by state lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence, who argue that it does not discriminate and is similar to federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. However, critics argue that the law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion" and could lead to discrimination. In response, state lawmakers are planning to "clarify" the law's language. The controversy has also led to boycott threats, with the NCAA expressing concern about the law's impact on student-athletes and employees, and businesses such as Angie's List putting expansion plans on hold. Celebrities such as George Takei and Ashton Kutcher have also spoken out against the law.
