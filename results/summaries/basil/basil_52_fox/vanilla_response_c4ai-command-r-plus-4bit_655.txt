SUMMARY: Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked a backlash, with the governors of Washington and Seattle banning government-funded travel to the state over concerns that the law could be used to discriminate against gays and others. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Mike Pence, allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," leading to fears that businesses could refuse services to gay residents. State lawmakers have defended the law, saying it does not discriminate and that they will clarify its language to address concerns. The law has also been criticized by the NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood celebrities, with some calling for a boycott of the state. The controversy comes as other states also introduce similar legislation, with 19 other states already having similar policies in place. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, a gay Democrat, issued executive orders banning state-funded travel to Indiana, with Murray also reviewing city contracts with Indiana-based companies. The boycott threatens to cut revenue for Indianapolis businesses during the upcoming men's NCAA Final Four basketball championships.
END OF SUMMARY.
