Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law. So, the main points are the reactions from other states and individuals, the concerns about discrimination, and the state's response.

First, Washington Governor Inslee and Seattle Mayor Murray banned state-funded travel to Indiana. They're worried the law could allow discrimination against gays. Inslee mentions that more states are embracing civil rights, so this law is a step back. Murray is reviewing city contracts with Indiana companies.

The law's main issue is whether it allows businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs. Indiana lawmakers, including Gov. Pence, are defending it, saying it's similar to federal and other state laws. They plan to clarify the law's language to prevent discrimination.

Other states are looking into similar laws, and there's concern about the impact on businesses, especially the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis. Companies like Angie's List are delaying expansions, and celebrities are calling for boycotts.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key actions, reactions, and the state's response. Make sure to mention the potential for discrimination, the clarifications, and the broader implications like the NCAA and economic impact.
