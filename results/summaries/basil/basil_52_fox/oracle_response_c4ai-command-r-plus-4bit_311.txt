SUMMARY: Discrimination and disturbing actions are never okay. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray are banning government-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new religious freedom law, which has been criticized for its potential to discriminate against gays and others. The law, signed by Republican Governor Mike Pence, allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which could result in a business discriminating against gay residents, such as a baker refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. While supporters of the law claim that it does not discriminate, state lawmakers are working to clarify the language to ensure that it cannot be used to deny services to certain groups. The backlash against the law is growing, with other states and cities joining the boycott and companies and public figures expressing their opposition. The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, has also raised concerns about the impact of the law on its student-athletes and employees. These actions send a clear message that discrimination will not be tolerated and that equality is a fundamental value.
END OF SUMMARY.
