SUMMARY: Washington's governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have joined the boycott of Indiana over its newly passed Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which many believe discriminates against gays and lesbians. The law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which could be used to deny services to same-sex couples. Despite claims from state lawmakers that the law does not discriminate, the backlash has continued to grow, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and several Hollywood celebrities also expressing their opposition. Washington's ban includes prohibiting state-funded travel to Indiana and reviewing contracts with Indiana-based companies. This boycott highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and LGBT rights, with many concerned about the potential for discrimination and the need for equal treatment under the law. The situation in Indiana reflects a broader trend, with 15 other states introducing similar religious freedom laws this year, sparking further debate over the balance between religious beliefs and equal rights. END OF SUMMARY.
