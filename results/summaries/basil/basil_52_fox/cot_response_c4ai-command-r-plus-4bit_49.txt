SUMMARY:
A moral backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law is growing, with Washington's governor and Seattle's mayor boycotting the state over claims that the law could lead to discrimination against gays and others. The law, which has been defended by state lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence, has been called "disturbing" and a threat to equality. The primary concern is that it might allow businesses to refuse service to gay residents, such as a baker denying a wedding cake order from a gay couple. Despite assurances from lawmakers that discrimination will not be allowed, there is still uncertainty about how the law will be applied and whether it will permit businesses to deny services to certain groups. The backlash has led to calls for clarification of the law, with even state lawmakers conceding that the explanation given by Gov. Pence was unclear. The law has also sparked concern from the NCAA, corporations, and Hollywood figures, who worry about its implications for their student-athletes, employees, and values. Some have called for a boycott of Indiana, expressing outrage and opposition to any form of discrimination. This situation highlights the ongoing struggle between religious freedom and equality, with many fearing that the law could be used to justify unfair treatment of certain groups.
