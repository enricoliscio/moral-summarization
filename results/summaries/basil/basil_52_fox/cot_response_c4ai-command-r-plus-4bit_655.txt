SUMMARY:
Amid the backlash to Indiana's new religious freedom law, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have joined the boycott threats, citing concerns over potential discrimination against gays. The law, signed by Gov. Mike Pence, has been criticized for allegedly allowing businesses to refuse services to gay residents, such as a baker denying a wedding cake order from a gay couple. Lawmakers defend and try to explain the legislation, drawing comparisons to similar federal laws and policies in other states. However, the Indiana law includes unique provisions that have raised concerns about discrimination. Seattle's leaders find the law disturbing and reflective of their residents' values, banning government-funded travel to Indiana and reviewing contracts with Indiana-based companies. The NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher have also expressed outrage, with the latter asking if Christian establishments will ban Jews and vice versa. Indiana lawmakers acknowledge the need for clarification, emphasizing their intention to prevent discrimination. They plan to swiftly amend the law to address these concerns, though some worry about the potential economic impact on the state, especially with the upcoming NCAA Final Four basketball championships.
