SUMMARY: There is widespread criticism and boycott threats against Indiana's new religious freedom law, which is perceived as discriminatory towards gays and others. Washington's Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns about potential discrimination and a lack of alignment with their values. The law, which is similar to federal legislation signed by President Clinton in 1993 and policies in other states, has sparked concerns about businesses being legally permitted to deny services to certain individuals. Lawmakers in Indiana are now working to clarify the language of the law to address these concerns and ensure it does not discriminate. However, the NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood celebrities have expressed outrage and opposition to the law, with some even calling for boycotts. The potential economic impact on Indianapolis businesses during the upcoming NCAA Final Four basketball championships has also raised concerns. Lawmakers' failure to adequately explain the law and address questions about its potential impact on gay customers has contributed to the backlash. The situation in Indiana reflects a broader trend, with several other states introducing or amending similar religious freedom laws.
