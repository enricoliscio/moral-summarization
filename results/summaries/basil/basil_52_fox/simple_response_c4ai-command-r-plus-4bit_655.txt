SUMMARY: Lawmakers in Indiana passed a law that would allow businesses to discriminate against gay residents, and now the state is facing a growing backlash, including boycott threats and travel bans from other states. The law, called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, is similar to a federal law passed by President Clinton in 1993 and policies in 19 other states. However, the Indiana law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," which could potentially allow discrimination against gay customers. Despite defending the law, Governor Mike Pence and state lawmakers are now trying to clarify its language to address concerns about discrimination. This incident highlights the ongoing struggle between religious freedom and equal rights for the LGBT community, with many people and businesses taking a stand against discrimination. It remains to be seen whether other states with similar laws will face similar backlash or if Indiana will be able to successfully clarify its law to address the concerns raised. The situation also raises important moral questions about the balance between religious freedom and equal rights, and the role of government in protecting the rights of all its citizens.
