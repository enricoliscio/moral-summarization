SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could discriminate against gays and others. The law has been criticized for allowing businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," potentially permitting discrimination against certain groups. Despite defenders' claims that the law does not discriminate, critics argue that it could lead to businesses refusing services to certain individuals, such as gay couples. The controversy has led to boycott threats, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and Hollywood figures expressing opposition. The law's defenders, including Gov. Mike Pence, have been accused of failing to clearly explain its implications. As the backlash grows, Indiana lawmakers are scrambling to clarify the law's language. The moral imperative is clear: discrimination has no place in society, and equality is a fundamental right that must be upheld.
