SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with critics arguing it could lead to discrimination against gays and others. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned government-funded travel to Indiana, citing the law's potential to discriminate. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said Washington will join other states and cities in "opposing" it. Murray, who is openly gay, said the law doesn't reflect Seattle's values and has told city departments to review contracts with Indiana-based companies. Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence are defending the law, but critics argue it allows businesses to "refuse" services to certain individuals, citing the example of a baker denying a gay couple a wedding cake. Lawmakers plan to "clarify" the law's language, but concerns remain about its potential to "burden" individuals and perpetuate discrimination. The backlash has led to boycott threats, with the NCAA and corporate figures expressing opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
