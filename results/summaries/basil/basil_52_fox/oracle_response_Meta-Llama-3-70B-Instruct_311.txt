SUMMARY:

Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked widespread backlash, with critics arguing it could discriminate against gays and others. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned government-funded travel to Indiana, citing the law's potential to discriminate. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, says the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents' values, which emphasize equality and reject discrimination. Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence defend the law, claiming it doesn't discriminate, but critics point out its differences from similar federal legislation. The law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," raising concerns about refusal of services to certain individuals. As a result, several states and cities are opposing the law, with some calling for boycotts. The NCAA, corporate America, and Hollywood figures have also expressed concern, with some even calling for a boycott. The law's defenders plan to clarify its language, but critics remain disturbed by its potential to burden individuals and perpetuate discrimination.
