SUMMARY:
Backlash and boycott threats against Indiana's new religious freedom law are mounting over concerns that it could be used to discriminate against gays and others. Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned state-funded travel to Indiana, citing the law as disturbing and discriminatory. The law has also sparked outrage from figures in corporate America and Hollywood, with many expressing opposition to its potential impact on equality and civil rights. Lawmakers in Indiana are attempting to clarify the legislation, stating that it does not discriminate and that they will work swiftly to address any concerns. However, the primary concern remains whether businesses will now be legally permitted to deny services to certain individuals, particularly gay residents. The NCAA and other organizations have also expressed worry about how the law might affect their employees and events. The controversy highlights a growing debate over religious freedom and discrimination, with several other states considering similar legislation. This issue has sparked moral outrage and calls for clarification to ensure equality and protect against discrimination.
