Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Indiana's new religious freedom law and the backlash it's receiving. The law is causing concerns that it might allow discrimination against gays and others. Governors and mayors are banning state-funded travel to Indiana, like Washington's Jay Inslee and Seattle's Ed Murray. They argue that the law doesn't reflect their values of equality. The example given is a baker refusing a wedding cake to a gay couple.

On the other side, Indiana lawmakers, including Gov. Mike Pence, are defending the law, saying it's similar to federal and other state laws. They mention that it's about religious freedom but are planning to clarify the language to prevent discrimination. Other states are also looking into similar laws, which shows it's a broader issue.

The article also mentions the potential economic impact, like the NCAA considering the law's effects and businesses reconsidering expansions in Indiana. There's a call for a boycott, with celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher speaking out.

I need to make sure the summary captures both sides: the opposition arguing against discrimination and the supporters trying to clarify the law to prevent that. The moral framing is about equality versus religious freedom, so I should highlight that tension.

I'll start by stating the backlash, mention the governors' actions, their reasons, the lawmakers' defense, the clarification efforts, and the broader implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspects are clear.

Let me draft it step by step. First, the backlash and the actions taken. Then, the concerns about discrimination. Next, the lawmakers' defense and their plan to clarify. Mention other states and the economic impact. Finally, the call for boycotts and the moral conflict.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and includes all key points without being too detailed. Also, avoid any markdown or special formatting as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Indiana's new religious freedom law has sparked backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns it could enable discrimination against gays. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, criticized the law as inconsistent with Seattle's values of equality. Inslee echoed this, stating the law "disturbs" him at a time when civil rights are increasingly embraced nationwide. Critics fear the law could allow businesses to refuse services to gay individuals, like a baker declining a wedding cake for a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Gov. Mike Pence, defend the law, noting it mirrors federal and other state legislation, but acknowledge the need to clarify its language to prevent discrimination. They argue the law does not discriminate and aim to address concerns. Meanwhile, 15 other states are considering similar laws, highlighting a national debate over religious freedom versus equality. The NCAA and businesses like Angieâ€™s List are also weighing the law's impact, with some reconsidering ties to Indiana. Celebrities, including George Takei and Ashton Kutcher, have called for boycotts, underscoring the moral conflict over religious rights and discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
