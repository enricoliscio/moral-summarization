SUMMARY: The backlash to Indiana's new religious freedom law is growing, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposing a ban on government-funded travel to the state. The law has been criticized for its potential to discriminate against gays and others, with many finding it disturbing that such a law would be passed at a time when more and more states and people are embracing civil rights for everyone. While Indiana lawmakers defend the law, claiming it does not discriminate, others are calling for a boycott, including actor George Takei. The law differs from similar policies in other states by allowing businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," leading to concerns about potential discrimination in the denial of services to certain groups. Lawmakers are now working to clarify the language of the law to address these concerns. The NCAA, corporations, and figures in Hollywood have also expressed opposition to the law, with some threatening to boycott the state.
