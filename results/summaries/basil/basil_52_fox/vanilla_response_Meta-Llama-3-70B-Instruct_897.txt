SUMMARY:

The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana. The law has been criticized for potentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gays and others. Inslee and Murray argue that the law goes against the values of equality and civil rights. Meanwhile, Indiana state lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, saying it does not discriminate and will not be allowed to do so. However, critics point out that the law differs from similar federal legislation and allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion." The controversy has led to boycott threats, with the NCAA, Angie's List, and celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher expressing opposition.
