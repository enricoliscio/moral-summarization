SUMMARY:
The backlash against Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could lead to discrimination against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it doesn't reflect the values of equality and civil rights that are increasingly being embraced in America. Murray, who is openly gay, said the law doesn't reflect Seattle's values of equality and that "discrimination has no place in our city." Despite defenders of the law claiming it doesn't discriminate, many are outraged, including celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher, who are calling for a boycott. The NCAA has also expressed concern about the law's potential impact on its student-athletes and employees. END OF SUMMARY.
