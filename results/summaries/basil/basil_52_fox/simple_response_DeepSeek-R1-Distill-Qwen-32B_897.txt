Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Indiana's new religious freedom law and the backlash it's receiving. Washington's governor and Seattle's mayor have banned state-funded travel to Indiana. They're concerned the law could allow discrimination against gays. Inslee and Murray are emphasizing equality and opposing the law. 

On the other side, Indiana lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, saying it doesn't discriminate. They mention that other states have similar laws, but Indiana's allows businesses to use religious freedom as a reason. There's confusion about whether businesses can refuse service to gays. 

The article also mentions the impact on events like the NCAA Final Four and possible boycotts affecting revenue. Companies like Angieâ€™s List are reconsidering expansions, and celebrities are speaking out against the law. 

I need to make sure the summary captures both the opposition and the defense of the law, highlighting the moral issues around discrimination and religious freedom. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the specified tokens. Let me structure it to include key points: backlash from Washington and Seattle, concerns about discrimination, lawmakers' defense, the clarification efforts, and the broader implications like boycotts and event impacts. 

I should ensure the moral framing is clear, showing the conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination values. Also, mention the potential economic consequences to show the stakes involved. That should cover the main elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has sparked backlash, with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns the law could enable discrimination against gays. Murray, an openly gay Democrat, called the law "disturbing" and inconsistent with Seattle's values of equality. Critics argue the law could allow businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ individuals, such as a baker denying a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, have defended the law, claiming it does not discriminate and is similar to federal and state laws. However, they acknowledge the need to clarify its language to address concerns. The law's potential impact on businesses and events, like the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis, has raised fears of economic losses. Corporate America and Hollywood figures, including actor George Takei, have called for boycotts, highlighting the tension between religious freedom and anti-discrimination values. END OF SUMMARY.
