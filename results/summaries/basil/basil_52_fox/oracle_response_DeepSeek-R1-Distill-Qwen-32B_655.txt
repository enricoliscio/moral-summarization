Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Indiana's religious freedom law and the backlash against it. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The law is causing controversy because people think it allows discrimination against gays. Governors and mayors are imposing bans on travel to Indiana. There's a lot of opposition and concern about discrimination. 

I should identify the key events: backlash, boycott threats, bans on travel, the law's potential to allow discrimination, lawmakers trying to clarify the law, and reactions from other states and organizations. 

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words like "discriminate," "disturbing," "ban," "opposing," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by outlining the main points and then weave in the moral language. Make sure to mention the opposition from Washington and Seattle, the concerns about discrimination, the lawmakers' attempts to clarify, and the broader implications across other states. 

I should also touch on the impact on events like the NCAA Final Four and the reactions from businesses and celebrities. 

Putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that captures the essence while using the required moral terms. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The backlash against Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act intensified as Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray imposed bans on state-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law could enable discrimination against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing," while Murray stated it doesn't reflect Seattle's values of equality. Critics argue the law might allow businesses to refuse services to gay residents, such as a baker denying a wedding cake to a gay couple. Indiana lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, are working to clarify the law, denying it permits discrimination. They emphasize the law aims to protect religious freedom, not to "burden" individuals' beliefs. However, confusion remains over whether businesses can legally refuse service based on religious grounds. The NCAA and Angieâ€™s List have also expressed concerns, with the latter delaying expansion plans in Indianapolis. Meanwhile, celebrities like George Takei and Ashton Kutcher are calling for boycotts, highlighting the law's potential to fuel discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
