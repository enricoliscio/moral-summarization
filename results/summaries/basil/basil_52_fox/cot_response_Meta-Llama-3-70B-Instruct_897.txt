SUMMARY:
The backlash against Indiana's new religious freedom law continues to grow, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana, citing concerns that the law has the potential to discriminate against gays and others. Inslee called the law "disturbing" and said it doesn't align with the values of embracing civil rights for everyone. Murray, who is openly gay, echoed this sentiment, stating that "discrimination has no place in our city" and that the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents' values of "equality 101." Meanwhile, Indiana lawmakers are trying to clarify the law, which they claim does not discriminate, but critics argue it could allow businesses to deny services to certain individuals. The controversy has sparked outrage, with many calling for boycotts and expressing concern about the law's implications. END OF SUMMARY.
