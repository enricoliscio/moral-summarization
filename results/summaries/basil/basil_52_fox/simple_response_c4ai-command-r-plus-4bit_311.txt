SUMMARY: The backlash to Indiana's new religious freedom law is growing, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to the state. The law, which is similar to a federal bill signed by President Clinton in 1993 and to laws in 19 other states, has been criticized for its potential to discriminate against gays and others. The primary concern is that the law might allow businesses to refuse services to gay residents, such as a baker being allowed to refuse an order from a gay couple for a wedding cake. Despite defenses of the law from state lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence, who signed it into law on Thursday, the backlash is intensifying. Seattle Mayor Murray has ordered city departments to review their contracts to see if they are doing business with any company headquartered in Indiana, while the NCAA and corporate figures have also expressed concern about the potential impact of the law. Lawmakers in Indiana are now working to clarify the language of the law to ensure that it does not allow for discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
