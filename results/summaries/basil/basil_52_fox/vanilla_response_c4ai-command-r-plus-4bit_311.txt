SUMMARY: Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray have banned government-funded travel to Indiana in response to the state's new religious freedom law, which is perceived as discriminatory towards gays and others. The law allows businesses to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion," and has sparked widespread backlash, including threats of boycotts. While state lawmakers defend the law, claiming it does not discriminate, they have also announced plans to clarify its language. The NCAA, corporate figures, and Hollywood celebrities have expressed concern about the law, and some businesses have halted expansion plans in the state. The law has also sparked similar legislative efforts in other states, with 15 states introducing similar laws or amendments in 2015. However, the backlash and concerns about potential discrimination have put the spotlight on Indiana, with some calling for a boycott of the upcoming men's NCAA Final Four basketball championships in Indianapolis.
END OF SUMMARY.
