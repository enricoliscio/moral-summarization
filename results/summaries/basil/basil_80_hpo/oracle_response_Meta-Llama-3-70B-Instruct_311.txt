SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, claiming that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. He has also criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation. Trump's tweets and interviews have raised concerns about his attempts to influence the investigation and collude with Russia. The President's actions have sparked controversy, with many questioning his motives and the implications of his actions on the integrity of the Justice Department.
