Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include: jailed, forwarded, investigation, colluded, undermine. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department as the 'deep state' and wants to jail Huma Abedin. He's responding to emails released by the State Department, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email use. Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump and his allies keep bringing this up. He also mentions the Justice Department acting on Comey and others, referring to the Russia collusion probe. Trump has been criticizing the Justice Department and FBI, undermining their work, and claims he has the right to direct investigations.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral terms. I'll start by stating Trump's attack on the Justice Department and his call to jail Abedin. Mention the emails and the FOIA request. Highlight the forwarded emails and the investigation. Then, note Trump's reference to Comey and the Russia collusion probe. Finally, mention his undermining of the Justice Department and his claims about directing investigations.

I should make sure to include all the moral words and keep the summary concise. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet followed the release of Abedin's emails, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. The emails, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, showed Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump and his allies continue to raise the issue, while he also criticized the Justice Department for not acting on "Comey and others," referencing the Russia collusion probe led by former FBI Director James Comey. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, claiming he has the right to direct government investigations. END OF SUMMARY.
