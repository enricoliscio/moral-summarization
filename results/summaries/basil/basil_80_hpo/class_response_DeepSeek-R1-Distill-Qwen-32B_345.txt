Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. The key terms are "jailed," "forwarded," "investigation," "colluded," and "undermine."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and wants Huma Abedin jailed. He's reacting to emails released by the State Department. These emails were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email server use. Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account.

I also need to mention Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and his attempts to undermine them. He's targeting Comey and others involved in the Russia investigation. Trump believes he has the right to direct the Justice Department himself, which is a significant point about his control over the investigations.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include all these elements. I'll start with Trump's attack on the Justice Department, mention his call for jailing Abedin, reference the forwarded emails, the ongoing investigation, the collusion angle, and his attempts to undermine the department. I'll make sure to keep the language concise and within 200 words.

I should also check that I'm using the morally framed words correctly. "Jailed" shows the severity of his request, "forwarded" indicates improper handling of information, "investigation" highlights the ongoing probe, "colluded" implies wrongdoing, and "undermine" shows his efforts to discredit the Justice Department.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering Trump's actions, the context of the emails, the implications of the investigation, and his broader attacks on the Justice Department. I'll ensure it's clear and sticks to the key points without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
President Donald Trump has renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet came in response to emails released by the State Department, which showed Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. These emails were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Trump also criticized former FBI Director James Comey and others involved in the Russia investigation, which he has sought to undermine. He has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the probe and claims he has the right to direct government investigations, asserting in a recent interview that he has "absolute right" to control the Justice Department. Trump's actions continue to raise concerns about his attempts to influence the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia.  
END OF SUMMARY.
