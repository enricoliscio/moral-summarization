SUMMARY:

President Trump launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies have continued to raise this issue, despite it being uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump also demanded action against "Comey and others", referring to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine his Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, claiming that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself.

END OF SUMMARY.
