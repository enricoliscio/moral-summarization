SUMMARY: President Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state," calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This comes in response to recently released emails that showed Abedin forwarding State Department emails, some containing passwords, to a personal account. Trump's tweet also referenced the Russia investigation, led by former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired, and his frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal. Trump's criticism undermines the Justice Department and FBI as they continue to investigate potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign. Trump believes he has the right to direct government investigations and has repeatedly asserted his power over the Justice Department.
END OF SUMMARY.
