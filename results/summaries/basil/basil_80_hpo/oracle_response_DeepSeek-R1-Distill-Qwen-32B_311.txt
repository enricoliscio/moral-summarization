Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally framed words: forwarded, colluded, influence, direct, do. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump attacking the Justice Department, calling it the 'deep state,' and wanting to jail Huma Abedin. He's reacting to released emails where she forwarded State Department emails, including passwords, to a personal account. The emails were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server. Trump also mentions Comey and the Russia investigation, criticizing the Justice Department and claiming he has the right to direct investigations.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using the key moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Trump's attack on the Justice Department as the 'deep state.' Then, I'll note his call to jail Abedin, linking it to her forwarding sensitive emails. I'll include the context of the emails being part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's email server. Next, I'll reference Trump's mention of Comey and the Russia collusion investigation. Finally, I'll highlight Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and his claim to have the right to direct government investigations.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes all the morally framed words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet came in response to emails released by the State Department, which showed Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails, including those containing passwords, to a personal account. These emails were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Trump also criticized former FBI Director James Comey and others involved in the Russia probe, asserting that the Justice Department must act on them. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, particularly as the Russia investigation into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia has intensified. He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the probe and has claimed he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations as he sees fit. END OF SUMMARY.
