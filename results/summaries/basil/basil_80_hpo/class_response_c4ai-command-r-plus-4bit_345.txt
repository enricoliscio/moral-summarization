SUMMARY: President Trump attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state," calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This attack comes in response to Abedin's emails, released by the State Department, which revealed that she forwarded State Department emails, including passwords, to a personal account. Trump's tweet also mentioned "Comey and others," referring to the former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia before being fired by Trump. The president's repeated attempts to undermine the Justice Department and FBI have raised concerns, especially as he claims the right to direct government investigations. His criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation further highlights Trump's disregard for the independence of these institutions. The president's actions and words continue to erode trust in the justice system and raise questions about his commitment to the rule of law.
END OF SUMMARY.
