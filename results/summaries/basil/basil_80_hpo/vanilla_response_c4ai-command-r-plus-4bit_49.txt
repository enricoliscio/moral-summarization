SUMMARY: President Donald Trump resumed his attacks on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state" and advocating for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. The attacks were prompted by the release of Abedin's emails, which revealed the forwarding of State Department emails to a personal account. Trump also mentioned "Comey and others," referring to former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump during the Russia investigation. Trump has repeatedly attempted to discredit the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies, and asserts his right to direct government investigations. His criticism extends to Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
