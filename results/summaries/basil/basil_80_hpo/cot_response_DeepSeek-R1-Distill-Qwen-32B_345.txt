Alright, I need to handle this query where the user wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. First, I'll read through the provided text to understand the context. The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department, referring to it as the 'deep state,' and calling for the jailing of a Clinton aide. 

The user has specified two main tasks. The first is to identify all single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "attacks," "deep state," "calls," "jailing," "renewed," "lash out," "undermine," "intensified," "criticized," "right," "absolute right," "direct," "supervise," and "collude" stand out as they carry moral implications.

Next, I need to summarize the article while preserving these moral frames. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's actions, his accusations against the Justice Department, and the context of the emails and the Russia investigation. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

I should also structure the response with STEP 1 listing the moral words and then the SUMMARY. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's tweet, mentioning Huma Abedin and the emails, the reference to Comey, and Trump's ongoing criticism of the Justice Department. I'll end with his claim about having the right to direct investigations, emphasizing his stance against the 'deep state.'

I need to keep the summary clear and within the word limit. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions or extra details not present in the original article. The goal is to accurately reflect Trump's actions and the moral framing without bias.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets all the user's requirements and that the moral words are appropriately included. Making sure the response is formatted correctly with the tokens as specified.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, referring to it as the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet followed the release of Abedin's emails, which included State Department communications, some containing passwords, sent to her personal account. Trump also criticized former FBI Director James Comey and the ongoing Russia investigation. He has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, claiming he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations. Trump's comments reflect his ongoing conflict with the Justice Department and his accusations of collusion between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
