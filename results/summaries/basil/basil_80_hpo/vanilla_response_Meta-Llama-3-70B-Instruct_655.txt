SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state". In a recent tweet, Trump called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over emails released by the State Department. The emails, uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign, showed Abedin forwarding State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump also referenced former FBI Director James Comey, implying that the Justice Department should take action against him. This is not the first time Trump has criticized the Justice Department and FBI, as he has repeatedly sought to undermine them as the Russia probe has intensified. Trump has also claimed that he has the right to direct government investigations himself, despite criticism from Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

END OF SUMMARY.
