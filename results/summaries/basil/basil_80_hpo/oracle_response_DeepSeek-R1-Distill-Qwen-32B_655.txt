Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: forwarded, colluded, influence, direct, do. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and wants to jail Huma Abedin. He's reacting to emails released by the State Department, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email use. Abedin forwarded sensitive emails, including passwords, to her personal account. Trump is also targeting Comey and others, and he's been criticizing the Justice Department and FBI, especially Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself. Trump claims he has the right to direct the Justice Department.

Now, I need to craft a summary that's concise, under 200 words, and includes those specific words. I should make sure each of those terms is present. I'll start by mentioning Trump's attack on the Justice Department, using "deep state." Then, I'll note his call to jail Abedin due to the forwarded emails. I'll connect this to the FBI's probe into Clinton's email use, which ties in "colluded" and "influence" as those were part of the investigation. 

Next, I'll mention Trump's criticism of Comey and others, and his claims about directing the Justice Department, using "direct" and "do." I should ensure the flow is logical and the summary captures the essence of Trump's actions and the moral framing.

I need to be careful not to add any extra information beyond what's in the article. Also, I should avoid any markdown or formatting as per the user's instructions. Let me piece this together, making sure each key point is covered and the moral terms are included naturally.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has criticized the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet followed the release of Abedin's emails, which were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. The emails showed Abedin forwarded sensitive State Department communications, including passwords, to a personal account. Trump also accused the Justice Department of failing to act on "Comey and others," referencing former FBI Director James Comey, who led the investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe. Trump claims he has the right to direct government investigations and has asserted his authority over the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
