SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again launched a vicious attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the imprisonment of a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump's tweet is a clear attempt to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, which are investigating his campaign's alleged collusion with Russia. Trump has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and has claimed that he has the right to direct government investigations himself. This is a blatant disregard for the rule of law and the independence of the Justice Department. Trump's actions are a threat to the very foundations of our democracy and demonstrate a disturbing lack of respect for the institutions that are meant to hold him accountable.

END OF SUMMARY.
