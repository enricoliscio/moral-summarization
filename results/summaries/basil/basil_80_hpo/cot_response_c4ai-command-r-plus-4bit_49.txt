SUMMARY: President Donald Trump launched a new attack on the Justice Department, which he branded as the "deep state." In a tweet, he called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a former aide to his 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton. This call for imprisonment was prompted by recently released emails from Abedin, which were uncovered during the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server use. Trump continues to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia investigation intensifies, and has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation. Trump asserts his right to direct government investigations, claiming absolute authority over the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
