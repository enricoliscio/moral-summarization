SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state" and demanding that a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, be jailed. This comes after the State Department released emails showing Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump also called for action against former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Russian election interference before being fired by Trump. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Justice Department and FBI, claiming he has the right to direct government investigations himself. This is despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation. Trump's tweets and interviews have sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified.
