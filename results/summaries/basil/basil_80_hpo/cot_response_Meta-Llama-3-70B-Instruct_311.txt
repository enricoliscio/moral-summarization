SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state". In a series of tweets, Trump lashed out at former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, calling for her to be jailed over emails released by the State Department. This move is seen as a continuation of Trump's efforts to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation, and claims to have the absolute right to direct government investigations himself. This assertion has raised concerns about Trump's understanding of the rule of law. The President's actions have been seen as a blatant attempt to undermine the integrity of the Justice Department, sparking fears about the erosion of democratic norms. END OF SUMMARY.
