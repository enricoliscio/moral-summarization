Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department and calling for jailing a Clinton aide. I should start by identifying the key points: Trump's criticism of the Justice Department as the "deep state," his tweet about Huma Abedin, the context of the emails from the FOIA request, and the mention of Comey. Also, Trump's broader attacks on the DOJ and FBI regarding the Russia probe. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral elements, like Trump's accusations and the implications of his statements. I should structure it to show Trump's ongoing conflict with the DOJ and his attempts to undermine their independence. Let me make sure to include the main actors and their actions without getting too detailed. I'll start with Trump's tweet, then the context of the emails, mention Comey, and conclude with his criticism of the DOJ's independence. That should cover the essential points while maintaining the moral angle presented in the article.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet came in response to emails from Abedin, released by the State Department, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. The emails reportedly included sensitive information, such as passwords, sent to a personal account. Trump also criticized former FBI Director James Comey, suggesting the Justice Department should act against him and others involved in the Russia probe. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the DOJ and FBI, claiming he has the right to direct government investigations, despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Trump's latest comments highlight his ongoing conflict with the Justice Department and his attempts to challenge its independence and authority. END OF SUMMARY.
