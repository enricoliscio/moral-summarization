SUMMARY: President Trump launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state" and demanding the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This comes in response to recently released emails from Abedin, which revealed forwarding of State Department emails, including passwords, to a personal account. Trump's tweet also mentioned "Comey and others," referring to the former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia before being fired by Trump. The president has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, and claims the right to direct government investigations. Trump's criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and his assertion of power over the Justice Department further fuel concerns about his commitment to the rule of law and independent investigations. END OF SUMMARY.
