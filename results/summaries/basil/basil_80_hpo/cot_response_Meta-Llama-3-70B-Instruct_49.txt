SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the "deep state" Justice Department, calling for the jailing of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine his Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation. Trump has asserted that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself, despite the ethical concerns. This is not the first time Trump has tried to exert control over the Justice Department, and his actions have been met with criticism from many. END OF SUMMARY.
