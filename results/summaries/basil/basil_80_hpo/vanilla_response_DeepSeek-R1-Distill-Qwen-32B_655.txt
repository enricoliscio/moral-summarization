Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department and calling for jailing a Clinton aide. 

So, Trump refers to the Justice Department as the "deep state." He's upset about emails from Huma Abedin, a Clinton aide, that were released. These emails were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email use when she was Secretary of State. 

He's also mentioning Comey, the former FBI Director, and criticizing the Justice Department's handling of the Russia probe. Trump feels he has the right to control the Justice Department, which he's been vocal about in interviews.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by noting Trump's attacks on the Justice Department and his call for jailing Abedin. Then mention the emails and their relation to the FBI probe. Also, include his criticism of Comey and his claims about controlling the Justice Department. 

I should make sure the summary is concise, covering all main points without getting too detailed. Let me put it all together in a clear and brief manner.
