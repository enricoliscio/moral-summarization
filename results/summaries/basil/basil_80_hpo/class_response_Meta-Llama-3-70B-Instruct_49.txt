SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation. Trump has also claimed to have the absolute right to direct government investigations himself, sparking concerns about his attempts to interfere with the probe into whether his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election.

Trump's attacks on the Justice Department and his calls for jailing Abedin are seen as an attempt to deflect attention from his own administration's controversies and to undermine the investigation into his campaign's alleged collusion with Russia. His actions have raised concerns about the integrity of the Justice Department and the rule of law.

END OF SUMMARY.
