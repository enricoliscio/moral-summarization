Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department, calling it the 'deep state,' and wanting to jail a top Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. He's reacting to emails that were released, which were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's email use. Trump and his allies keep bringing up this issue. He also mentions Comey and others, referring to the Russia investigation. Trump has been criticizing the Justice Department and FBI, especially Jeff Sessions, and claims he has the right to direct investigations himself.

Now, for the first part, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral or evaluative connotation. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

"Attacks" - implies aggression or criticism.
"Justice Department" - not inherently moral, but in context, it's being criticized.
"Deep state" - implies a hidden, possibly corrupt power structure.
"Jailing" - a strong legal action, moral judgment.
"Top Clinton aide" - not inherently moral, but in context, it's about someone being targeted.
"Emails" - not moral, but part of the scandal.
"Released" - neutral.
"State Department" - neutral.
"Freedom of Information Act" - neutral.
"Lawsuit" - neutral.
"Filed" - neutral.
"Conservative group Judicial Watch" - not moral, but contextually part of the political landscape.
"Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server" - implies wrongdoing.
"Forwarded" - not moral, but in context, it's about mishandling information.
"Passwords" - not moral, but part of the issue.
"Trump and his right-wing allies" - not moral, but allies in a political context.
"Renew" - not moral.
"Probe" - implies investigation, which can have moral implications.
"Colluded" - implies conspiracy, which is a moral issue.
"Russia" - not moral, but contextually tied to interference.
"Justice Department must act" - implies urgency and moral obligation.
"Comey and others" - Comey was involved in the Russia probe, which is a moral issue.
"Undermine" - implies weakening, which is a negative action.
"Russia probe" - implies investigation into potential wrongdoing.
"Intensified" - not moral, but contextually about increased scrutiny.
"Attacked" - implies criticism.
"Repeatedly" - emphasizes frequency.
"Undermine" - again, negative action.
"Recused" - implies avoiding conflict of interest, which is a moral decision.
"Supervising" - neutral.
"Absolute right" - implies a strong moral or legal claim.
"Do what I want" - implies control, which can be seen as overreach.

Wait, I think I went a bit overboard. Let me focus on the words that are explicitly moral or evaluative. Words like "attacks," "deep state," "jailing," "colluded," "undermine," "probe," "absolute right," "do what I want." Maybe "deep state" is a term with a negative connotation, implying a corrupt system. "Jailing" is a severe punishment, so it's a strong moral judgment. "Colluded" suggests conspiracy, which is a moral wrongdoing. "Undermine" implies weakening something, which is negative. "Probe" is an investigation, which can have moral implications. "Absolute right" and "do what I want" suggest Trump is asserting control, which could be seen as overstepping or abusing power.

So, the morally framed words are: attacks, deep state, jailing, colluded, undermine, probe, absolute right, do what I want.

Wait, but "colluded" is part of the article's context, not necessarily a word Trump used. The article says Trump's campaign was investigated for collusion. So, in the summary, I need to include these words where applicable.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral framing. I should mention Trump attacking the Justice Department as the 'deep state,' wanting to jail Huma Abedin, referencing the emails and the FBI probe. Also, mention Trump's criticism of Comey and Sessions, and his claim to have control over the Justice Department.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the morally framed words where appropriate. Let me structure it:

Start with Trump attacking the Justice Department as the 'deep state.' Mention his call to jail Huma Abedin. Reference the emails released by the State Department and the FBI probe into Clinton's email use. Note that Trump and his allies continue to bring up this issue. Mention Trump's tweet about the Justice Department acting on Comey and others, referring to the Russia probe. Highlight Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and FBI, his claims about Sessions recusing himself, and his assertion of control over the Justice Department.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points with the moral framing intact.

**SUMMARY:**
President Trump has renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and has called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This follows the release of emails involving Abedin, which were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump and his allies continue to raise this issue, with Trump also targeting former FBI Director James Comey and others involved in the Russia investigation. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Justice Department and FBI, asserting his "absolute right" to control government investigations, despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia probe. His comments reflect a broader pattern of undermining the Justice Department's independence. END OF SUMMARY.
