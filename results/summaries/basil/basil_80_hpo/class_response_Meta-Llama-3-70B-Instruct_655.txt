SUMMARY:

President Trump launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was sparked by the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies have repeatedly raised this issue, seeking to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has also targeted former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department, claiming he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. His actions have been widely criticized, with many seeing them as an attempt to obstruct justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
