SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state," calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to his 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton. In an early-morning tweet, Trump lashed out at Abedin, referencing emails released by the State Department, which revealed that she had forwarded official emails to a personal account. Trump, with the support of his right-wing allies, continues to raise this issue as ammunition against Clinton. The president also criticized the Justice Department for their inaction regarding former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May while leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly undermined the Justice Department and FBI, criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, and asserted his right to direct government investigations. Trump's actions and words reveal a concerning pattern of abuse of power and a disregard for the independence of the Justice Department and the rule of law.
END OF SUMMARY.
