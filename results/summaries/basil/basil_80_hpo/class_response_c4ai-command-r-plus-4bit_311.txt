SUMMARY: President Trump launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, branding it as the 'Deep State' and calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This call comes in response to recently released emails which revealed Abedin had forwarded State Department emails, some containing passwords, to her personal account. Trump's tweet also mentioned "Comey and others," referencing the former FBI Director who was leading the investigation into Trump's potential collusion with Russia before being fired by the President. Trump's ongoing criticism of the Justice Department and FBI, including his public undermining of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, raises concerns about his attempts to influence government investigations. His assertion of having the "absolute right" to direct the Justice Department as he sees fit is particularly worrying.
END OF SUMMARY.
