Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include certain morally charged words: forwarded, colluded, influence, direct, do. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department as the "deep state" and wants to jail Huma Abedin. The article mentions that emails were forwarded, collusion with Russia, influence on the election, Trump's desire to direct investigations, and his assertion to do what he wants with the Justice Department.

I should start the summary by highlighting Trump's accusations against the Justice Department. Then, mention the emails forwarded by Abedin and the collusion allegations. I need to include how Trump wants the Justice Department to act on Comey and others, referencing the influence on the election. Also, I should note Trump's claims about directing investigations and his right to do so.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the specified moral words. I'll structure it to flow logically, connecting each point while preserving the original framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump has renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet came in response to emails forwarded by Abedin during her time at the State Department, which were recently disclosed. These emails, part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server, reportedly included sensitive information like passwords. Trump and his allies continue to raise concerns about potential collusion between his campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election. He also criticized the Justice Department for not acting on "Comey and others," referring to former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Russia investigation before being fired. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, claiming he has the right to direct government investigations and asserting his authority to do as he pleases with the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
