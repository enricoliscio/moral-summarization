Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a specific list of morally framed words: forwarded, colluded, influence, direct, do. I have to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and wants to jail Huma Abedin, a Clinton aide. The article mentions that Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including passwords, to a personal account. Trump is using this to criticize the Justice Department, referencing Comey and the Russia investigation.

I need to highlight the moral elements. The word "forwarded" is used to describe Abedin's action, which implies a breach of protocol. "Colluded" refers to the alleged coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which is a serious accusation. "Influence" is about the impact on the election, which is a key moral issue. "Direct" and "do" are used in the context of Trump's assertion of control over the Justice Department, which has implications on the rule of law.

I should structure the summary to include these words. Start by stating Trump's attack on the Justice Department and his demand for jailing Abedin. Mention the forwarded emails and the collusion allegations. Then, touch on Trump's claims about directing the Justice Department and undermining the FBI's independence.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear. I'll make sure each of the specified words is included without making the summary too wordy. Let me draft this, checking each point and the required words.

SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized the Justice Department as the "deep state" and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweets targeted Abedin after emails she forwarded from the State Department to a personal account were released, including some with passwords. These emails were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump also criticized former FBI Director James Comey, who led the investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, claiming he has the right to direct government investigations. He has also criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia probe. Trump's comments highlight his ongoing conflict with the Justice Department and his assertion of control over its actions. END OF SUMMARY.
