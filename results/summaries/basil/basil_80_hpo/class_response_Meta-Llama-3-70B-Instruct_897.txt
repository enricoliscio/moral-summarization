SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump's tweet also demanded action against "Comey and others", referencing former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Trump's campaign's potential collusion with Russia. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and claiming he has the right to direct government investigations himself. Trump's actions are a clear attempt to undermine the integrity of the Justice Department and the investigation into his campaign's potential wrongdoing.

END OF SUMMARY.
