SUMMARY: 
President Donald Trump attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state," calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to his 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton. This criticism comes in response to recently released emails from Abedin, which were uncovered during the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server usage. In his tweet, Trump also mentioned "Comey and others," referring to the former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia before being fired by Trump. The president has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia investigation has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from supervision of the Russia investigation. Trump asserts he has the right to direct government investigations, a claim that has drawn widespread condemnation. END OF SUMMARY.
