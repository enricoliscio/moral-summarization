SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which were uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails showed Abedin forwarding State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies have continued to raise this issue, seeking to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and claims to have the absolute right to direct government investigations himself. Trump's actions have sparked concerns about his attempts to exert control over the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
