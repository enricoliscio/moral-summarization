Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Trump attacking the Justice Department and calling for jailing a Clinton aide. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Trump is renewing his attack on the Justice Department, referring to it as the "deep state." He's specifically targeting Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump tweeted about this after some emails were released by the State Department. These emails were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server during her time as Secretary of State. Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account, which Judicial Watch, a conservative group, obtained through a FOIA lawsuit.

Trump is also bringing up James Comey, the former FBI Director, who was leading the Russia investigation. Trump fired Comey and has been critical of the Justice Department's handling of the Russia probe. He's been undermining the FBI and DOJ, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and claiming he has the right to direct government investigations.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I should focus on the main actions: Trump's tweets about the Justice Department, the release of Abedin's emails, the context of the FBI's investigation, Trump's criticism of Comey and Sessions, and his assertion of authority over the Justice Department.

Let me structure this: Start with Trump renewing his attack, mention the Justice Department as the "deep state," reference the released emails about Abedin, the context of the FBI probe, Trump's call for action against her, mention Comey and the Russia investigation, Trump's criticisms of Sessions and his claims about directing investigations, and end with his assertion in the NYT interview.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and includes all key points without being too wordy. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and criticized Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over emails released by the State Department. The emails, obtained through a FOIA lawsuit by Judicial Watch, were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server. Abedin forwarded sensitive State Department emails, including those with passwords, to a personal account. Trump also referenced former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Russia investigation before being fired. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asserting his authority to direct government investigations. He claimed in a New York Times interview that he has the "absolute right" to control the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
