SUMMARY: Trump renews attacks on Justice Department and calls for jailing Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, in response to recently released emails. Abedin forwarded State Department emails, including passwords, to a personal account, an action that Trump and his right-wing allies condemn. The President also demands action against James Comey, the former FBI Director, as the Russia investigation intensifies. Trump undermines the Justice Department and FBI, criticizes Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal, and claims the right to direct government investigations. His actions and statements raise concerns about influencing the Justice Department and the ongoing Russia probe, with potential moral implications regarding the abuse of power and obstruction of justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
