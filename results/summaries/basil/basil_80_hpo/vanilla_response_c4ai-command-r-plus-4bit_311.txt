SUMMARY: President Donald Trump renewed attacks on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and advocated for the jailing of Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin. The attacks come in response to Abedin's emails released by the State Department, which revealed that she forwarded State Department emails to her personal account. Trump criticized the department for not acting on former FBI Director James Comey and others, undermining the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has repeatedly asserted his right to direct government investigations and criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Trump's actions and statements highlight his attempts to influence the Justice Department and shape public opinion through his criticisms and assertions of power.
