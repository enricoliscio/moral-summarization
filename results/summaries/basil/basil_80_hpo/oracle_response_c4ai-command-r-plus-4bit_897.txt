SUMMARY: President Trump launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, branding it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This was in response to recently released emails, which revealed Abedin had forwarded State Department emails, some containing passwords, to her personal account. Trump's tweet also targeted former FBI Director James Comey, implying he should face consequences for his involvement in the Russia probe. 

Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and FBI has been ongoing, particularly as the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia to influence the election has intensified. The president has repeatedly undermined the independence of these institutions and asserted his right to direct government investigations. His attacks on Abedin and calls for her imprisonment reflect a disregard for due process and a willingness to use his political power to target opponents. Trump's actions and words raise serious moral concerns about the abuse of power and the undermining of democratic institutions.
END OF SUMMARY.
