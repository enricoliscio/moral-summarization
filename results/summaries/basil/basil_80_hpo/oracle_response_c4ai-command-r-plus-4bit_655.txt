SUMMARY: President Trump launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, branding it as the "deep state," and calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This comes in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which revealed that she forwarded State Department emails, including sensitive information, to a personal account. Trump's tweet also targeted former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired while Comey was leading the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election. Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and FBI has been persistent, and he has even claimed the right to direct government investigations himself. The president's actions and words raise serious moral concerns about the abuse of power, the subversion of democratic institutions, and the potential obstruction of justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
