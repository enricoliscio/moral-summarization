Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. He made these comments in a tweet after some emails were released. The emails were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The emails included sensitive information like passwords, which Abedin forwarded to a personal account. Trump and his allies keep bringing this up.

Additionally, Trump mentioned the Justice Department should act on Comey and others, referring to the former FBI Director. He's been criticizing the Justice Department and FBI, especially since the Russia probe started. He's critical of Jeff Sessions for recusing himself and claims he has the right to direct government investigations.

I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's accusations, the context of the emails, his criticism of the Justice Department, and his claims about his authority over the DOJ. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's attack on the Justice Department, mention the call for jailing Abedin, explain the context of the emails and the FBI probe. Then, include his criticism of Comey and the Justice Department, and his assertion of authority over the DOJ.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise. Make sure to include all key elements without adding extra information. Also, preserve the moral framing, which seems to highlight Trump's ongoing conflict with the Justice Department and his attempts to influence the Russia investigation.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.
