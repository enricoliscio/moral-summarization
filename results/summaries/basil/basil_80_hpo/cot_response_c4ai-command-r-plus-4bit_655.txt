SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump resumed his attack on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state" and demanding the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. This action comes as a response to the release of Abedin's emails by the State Department, which revealed that she had forwarded official emails to her personal account, including some with passwords. Trump's tweet also mentioned "Comey and others," referring to the former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump and was leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly sought to malign the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his recusal from the Russia investigation. Trump has also claimed the right to direct government investigations himself, asserting his "absolute right" over the Justice Department. This behavior demonstrates Trump's attempt to malign and undermine the integrity of the Justice Department and those who dare to investigate him.
END OF SUMMARY.
