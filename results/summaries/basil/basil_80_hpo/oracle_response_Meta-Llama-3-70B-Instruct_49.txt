SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, claiming that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. He has also criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, and has implied that former FBI Director James Comey and others should be jailed. Trump's actions and words have been seen as an attempt to influence the investigation and collude with his allies to discredit the Justice Department.

END OF SUMMARY.
