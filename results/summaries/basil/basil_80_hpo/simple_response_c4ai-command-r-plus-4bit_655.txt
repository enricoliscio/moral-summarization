SUMMARY: President Trump renews his immoral assault on the rule of law, attacking the Justice Department as the "deep state" and calling for the imprisonment of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. In his unethical attempt to undermine the Justice Department and the FBI, Trump lashed out at Abedin over recently released emails, ignoring the context and continuing to stoke false allegations. Trump's outrage is clearly misplaced, as the real threat to democracy lies in his own actions, such as his firing of FBI Director James Comey and his repeated attempts to interfere in the Russia investigation. The president's assertion that he has the "absolute right" to direct the Justice Department as he sees fit is a blatant disregard for the independence of the judicial system and a dangerous precedent for abuse of power. Trump's behavior is a stark reminder of the importance of checks and balances and the need for ethical leadership in the White House.
END OF SUMMARY.
