SUMMARY:

President Trump launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump also demanded action against "Comey and others," referring to former FBI Director James Comey, who was investigating Trump's campaign for colluding with Russia to influence the election. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, claiming he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. This is not the first time Trump has tried to exert control over the Justice Department, having criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
