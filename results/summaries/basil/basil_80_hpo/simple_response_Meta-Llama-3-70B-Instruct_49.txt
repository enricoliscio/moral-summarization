SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the imprisonment of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump has repeatedly attempted to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and claiming that he has the right to direct government investigations himself. This behavior is morally reprehensible, as it undermines the independence of the Justice Department and the rule of law. Trump's actions are a clear attempt to abuse his power and intimidate his political opponents. His disregard for the norms of democratic governance is a threat to the very foundations of our system of government.

END OF SUMMARY.
