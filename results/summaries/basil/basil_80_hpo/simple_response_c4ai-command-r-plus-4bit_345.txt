SUMMARY: President Trump's latest attack on the Justice Department and his call for the jailing of Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, highlights a disturbing pattern of moral corruption and abuse of power. Trump's willingness to use his position to target political rivals and undermine the rule of law is a threat to the foundations of American democracy. Abedin's "crime," the forwarding of State Department emails to a personal account, pales in comparison to the ongoing revelations of Trump's campaign collusion with Russia and his attempts to obstruct justice. Trump's assertion that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations is a dangerous precedent and a blatant abuse of power. The "deep state" rhetoric is a distraction from the real issue: Trump's own moral failings and his administration's corruption. The Justice Department must act to hold Trump and his allies accountable and uphold the moral integrity of the nation's institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
