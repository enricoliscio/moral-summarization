SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump's tweet also targeted former FBI Director James Comey, implying that the Justice Department should take action against him. This is not the first time Trump has attempted to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, as he has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Trump has even claimed to have the absolute right to direct government investigations himself, raising concerns about the independence of the Justice Department. Trump's actions and rhetoric continue to erode trust in the institutions of justice and democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
