SUMMARY: Trump attacks the Justice Department and calls for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, in a tweet that renews his criticism of the "deep state." The president's outrage was apparently prompted by the disclosure of Abedin's emails, which revealed that she forwarded State Department emails, including sensitive information, to a personal account. This issue has been repeatedly raised by Trump and his right-wing allies, who claim that Abedin's actions, along with Clinton's use of a private email server, are evidence of collusion and an attempt to influence the 2016 election. Trump's tweet also mentioned "Comey and others," referring to his desire for the Justice Department to take action against the former FBI Director, James Comey, who was investigating Trump's potential collusion with Russia. The president has repeatedly undermined the Justice Department and FBI, criticized the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, and asserted his right to direct government investigations. Trump's actions and words raise concerns about the influence he seeks to exert over the Justice Department and the potential consequences for those who are targeted by his outrage.
END OF SUMMARY.
