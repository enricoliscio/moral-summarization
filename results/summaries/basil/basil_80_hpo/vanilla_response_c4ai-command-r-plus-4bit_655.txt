SUMMARY: President Donald Trump attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state," alleging bias and demanding the jailing of Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. Trump's accusations were based on recently released Abedin emails, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's private email server. Trump also referenced former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired while the Russia investigation was ongoing. The President has repeatedly undermined the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing their actions and asserting his right to direct investigations. Trump's criticism extends to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation, a decision that Trump has publicly rebuked. The President's comments highlight his ongoing attempts to discredit the Justice Department and shape investigations to his advantage.
END OF SUMMARY.
