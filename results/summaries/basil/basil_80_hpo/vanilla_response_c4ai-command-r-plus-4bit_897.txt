SUMMARY: President Donald Trump attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state" and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's comments came in response to recently released emails from Abedin that were uncovered during the 2016 election. The emails revealed that Abedin had forwarded State Department emails, some containing passwords, to a personal account. Trump also referenced former FBI Director James Comey in his tweet, continuing his criticism of the Russia investigation. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and asserting his right to direct government investigations. Trump's actions and statements raise concerns about political interference in the Justice Department and the ongoing Russia probe.
END OF SUMMARY.
