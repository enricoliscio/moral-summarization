SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has once again attacked his "deep state" Justice Department, this time calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to his 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton. In an early-morning tweet, Trump lashed out at Abedin over recently released emails, accusing her of wrongdoing and demanding action from the Justice Department. The President's tweet is part of a pattern of undermining the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has fired former FBI Director James Comey, criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, and asserted his "absolute right" to direct the Justice Department. The President and his right-wing allies continue to raise issues uncovered during the 2016 campaign, seeking to malign Clinton and her aides while downplaying the seriousness of the ongoing investigation into his own campaign's potential collusion with Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
