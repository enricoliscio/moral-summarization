Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user is asking for a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points. The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department and calling for the jailing of a Clinton aide. 

First, I'll identify the key elements: Trump's tweets about the "deep state," his criticism of Huma Abedin, the emails from the FOIA request, the mention of James Comey, and his ongoing conflict with the Justice Department regarding the Russia probe.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's actions, the context of the emails, his references to Comey, and his broader issues with the Justice Department. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is brief but clear.

Also, the user specified to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting Trump's tweets to the ongoing probes and his criticisms of the Justice Department and Comey. 

I'll make sure to mention the FOIA lawsuit, the content of the emails, and Trump's implication that the Justice Department should take action. I'll also include his criticism of Comey and his belief in controlling the Justice Department.

Finally, I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. I think this approach covers all necessary points concisely.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has criticized the Justice Department, referring to it as the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet came after emails involving Abedin were released by the State Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The emails, part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's use of a private email server, reportedly included sensitive information like passwords. Trump and his allies continue to raise this issue. He also criticized former FBI Director James Comey, who led the investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department and FBI over the Russia probe, claiming he has the right to control government investigations. He has also criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the probe. Trump's latest comments reflect his ongoing conflict with the Justice Department and its handling of the Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
