SUMMARY: President Trump launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was prompted by the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump also demanded action against "Comey and others", referring to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Russian collusion with Trump's campaign. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and claiming he has the right to direct government investigations himself. Trump's actions are a blatant attempt to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
