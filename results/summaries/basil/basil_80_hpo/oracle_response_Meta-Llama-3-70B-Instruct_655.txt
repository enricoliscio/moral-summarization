SUMMARY:

President Trump has renewed his attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, claiming that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. He has also criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, which looked into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Trump's actions have been seen as an attempt to exert influence over the Justice Department and undermine its independence.

END OF SUMMARY.
