SUMMARY: In a blatant abuse of power, President Donald Trump once again attacked the Justice Department as the "deep state" and called for the jailing of Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. This outrageous demand comes as Trump continues to face scrutiny in the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly sought to undermine and divert attention from. The president's tweet lashed out at Abedin, seizing on recently released emails that showed she forwarded State Department emails to a personal account, some of which contained passwords. In a disturbing display of hypocrisy and authoritarian tendencies, Trump called for the jailing of Abedin while also demanding action against former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired to obstruct the Russia investigation. Trump's criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and his assertion of a "right to do what I want" with the Justice Department demonstrate a profound disregard for the rule of law and the independence of government institutions. Trump's behavior is a threat to democracy and the foundations of American justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
