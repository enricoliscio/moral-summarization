Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Trump attacking the Justice Department and calling for jailing a Clinton aide. 

First, I should identify the key points: Trump refers to the Justice Department as the "deep state," criticizes Huma Abedin over emails, mentions Comey and the Russia probe, and claims authority over the Justice Department.

I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral implications, like Trump's undermining of institutions and the potential conflict of interest. Also, highlight how he's using the emails to continue the Clinton investigation.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all essential elements without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the FOIA lawsuit and the context of the emails being part of the FBI probe.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's attack on the Justice Department, mention the tweet about Huma Abedin, explain the emails' background, then move to the broader context of the Russia probe and Trump's claims about his authority.

Ensure the summary flows logically and maintains the critical tone towards Trump's actions. Avoid any personal opinions, just present the facts as framed in the article.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has criticized the Justice Department as the "deep state" and called for the jailing of Hillary Clinton's former aide, Huma Abedin, over emails that were forwarded to a personal account. The emails, released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department and FBI, particularly over the Russia probe, and has claimed authority to direct government investigations, asserting that he has the "absolute right" to control the Justice Department. His comments come amid ongoing scrutiny of his administration's ties to Russia during the 2016 election. Trump's latest tweets highlight his continued efforts to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, while also renewing focus on Clinton-related issues. END OF SUMMARY.
