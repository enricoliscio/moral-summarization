SUMMARY: Trump renews attacks on the "deep state" Justice Department, calling for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, based on recently released emails. Abedin forwarded State Department emails, some containing passwords, to a personal account. This revelation adds to the ongoing narrative of Trump and his right-wing allies' attempts to influence the Justice Department and direct investigations. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Justice Department and FBI, particularly in relation to the Russia probe, where the investigation is examining whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. The president has also asserted his supposed right to direct government investigations himself, undermining the independence of these institutions. This latest incident further highlights the ethical and legal questions surrounding Trump's relationship with the Justice Department and his attempts to sway public opinion and exert control over government bodies. END OF SUMMARY.
