SUMMARY:

In a disturbing display of authoritarianism, President Trump has once again attacked the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was a response to the release of Abedin's emails, which were uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign. The President's actions are a clear attempt to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and has claimed to have the right to direct government investigations himself. This is a blatant disregard for the rule of law and the independence of the Justice Department. Trump's actions are a threat to the very foundations of our democracy and demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the principles of justice and accountability.

END OF SUMMARY.
