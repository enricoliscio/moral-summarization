Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep the morally framed words: jailed, forwarded, investigation, colluded, undermine. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department as the 'deep state' and wants to jail Huma Abedin. The article mentions the emails she forwarded, the investigation into Clinton's email server, and Trump's undermining of the Justice Department and FBI. He's critical of Comey and Sessions, and believes he has the right to direct the Justice Department.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's attack on the Justice Department and his call to jail Abedin. Then, I'll include the reason: the forwarded emails and the ongoing investigation. I should also note his criticism of Comey and Sessions, and his belief in controlling the Justice Department. 

I have to make sure to include all the moral terms: jailed, forwarded, investigation, colluded, undermine. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's tweets, then the reasons, and his broader criticisms. 

I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise. Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and includes the necessary moral framing words without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and demanded that Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, be jailed. This came after emails from Abedin, which included forwarded State Department communications and passwords, were released by the State Department. These emails were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Trump also criticized former FBI Director James Comey and others involved in the Russia investigation, asserting that the Justice Department must act on them. Trump has consistently sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, particularly as the Russia probe intensified. He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation and claims he has the authority to direct government investigations himself, asserting his "absolute right" to control the Justice Department. END OF SUMMARY.
