SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state" and demanding that a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, be jailed. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump also called for action against former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election before Trump fired him. This is not the first time Trump has criticized the Justice Department and FBI, as he has repeatedly sought to undermine them as the Russia probe has intensified. Trump has also claimed that he has the right to direct government investigations himself, despite criticism from others.

END OF SUMMARY.
