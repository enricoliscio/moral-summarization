SUMMARY: President Trump launched a new attack on the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state" and demanding the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. This demand was made in response to recently released emails that showed Abedin forwarding State Department emails to her personal account, some of which contained passwords. In his tweet, Trump also referenced the ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, calling for action against former FBI Director James Comey and others. Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and FBI has been persistent, particularly his disapproval of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation. Trump's claim of having the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself is concerning and undermines the independence of these institutions. Trump's actions and words highlight a disregard for the rule of law and an attempt to influence the justice system for personal gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
