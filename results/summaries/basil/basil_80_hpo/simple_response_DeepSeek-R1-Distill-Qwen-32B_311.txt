Alright, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about President Trump attacking the Justice Department, calling it the 'deep state,' and demanding that a top Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, be jailed. He made these comments on Twitter after some emails were released. These emails were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's private email server, and they included sensitive information like passwords.

The author seems to be framing Trump's actions as an attempt to undermine the Justice Department and the FBI, especially in the context of the Russia probe. Trump is criticizing the Justice Department and FBI, claiming he has the right to direct government investigations himself. He's also targeting Comey, the former FBI Director, who was leading the Russia investigation before being fired.

I need to capture the moral implications here. The author is likely highlighting Trump's interference with the justice system and his ongoing conflict with the institutions meant to investigate him. The moral framing probably emphasizes the potential misuse of power and the undermining of checks and balances in government.

So, the summary should include Trump's accusations against the Justice Department, his call for jailing Abedin, the context of the emails, and his broader criticism of the FBI and the Russia probe. It should also touch on the implications of Trump's claims about controlling the Justice Department, suggesting a conflict of interest or abuse of power.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's attack, then the specifics about Abedin and the emails, followed by the references to Comey and the Russia investigation, and finally his claims about his authority over the Justice Department. Keeping it concise but covering all these points within 200 words.

I need to make sure the summary doesn't add any new information but accurately reflects the author's moral perspective on Trump's actions. The focus is on the potential for abuse of power and the undermining of the justice system, so I should highlight those aspects.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has criticized the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Hillary Clinton's former aide, Huma Abedin, over emails released by the State Department. The emails, obtained through a FOIA request, were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server and included sensitive information like passwords. Trump's comments, made via tweet, also targeted former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Russia investigation before being fired. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Justice Department and FBI, asserting his authority to direct government investigations, despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia probe. The president's actions raise concerns about his interference with the justice system and the integrity of the Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
