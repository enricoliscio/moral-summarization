SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies continue to raise the issue, seeking to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and asserted that he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. Trump's actions have sparked concerns about his attempt to exert control over the Justice Department and subvert the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
