SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it a "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to a personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies have repeatedly raised this issue, seeking to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies. Trump has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation and claims to have the absolute right to direct government investigations himself. This is not the first time Trump has sought to undermine the Justice Department, and his actions have been widely criticized. END OF SUMMARY.
