SUMMARY: President Donald Trump resumed his criticism of the Justice Department and "deep state," advocating for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton's former aide Huma Abedin. The calls came in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's private email server. Trump accused Abedin of compromising State Department emails and passwords. Trump also alluded to former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump while leading the Russia investigation. Trump has repeatedly attempted to discredit the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe intensifies, criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself. Trump has claimed the right to direct government investigations, including the Justice Department, as he sees fit.
END OF SUMMARY.
