Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific words that are morally charged: "forwarded," "colluded," "influence," "direct," and "do." I should make sure to include these in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is attacking the Justice Department, calling it the "deep state," and wants to jail Huma Abedin. He's reacting to emails she forwarded from the State Department to her personal account, which were part of the FBI's probe into Clinton's email server. Trump and his allies keep bringing this up.

He also mentions Comey and others, referring to the Russia investigation. Trump has been criticizing the Justice Department and FBI, undermining their work. He's critical of Jeff Sessions for recusing himself and claims he has the right to direct investigations himself, even saying he has an absolute right to do so.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's attack on the Justice Department and his call to jail Abedin. Then, I'll note the emails she forwarded and the context of the FBI's probe. Next, I'll include Trump's reference to Comey and his criticism of Sessions, along with his claims about directing the Justice Department.

I should make sure to use the moral words where appropriate. For example, "forwarded" when talking about the emails, "colluded" when referring to the Russia probe, "influence" when talking about the election, "direct" when mentioning Trump's claims, and "do" in the context of his rights.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's actions, the context of the emails, the mention of Comey and the Russia probe, and then his criticisms of the Justice Department and his claims of authority.

Let me put this together, ensuring each point is covered concisely and the moral framing words are included where relevant.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has renewed his criticism of the Justice Department, labeling it the "deep state," and called for the jailing of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet came in response to emails forwarded by Abedin from the State Department to her personal account, which were part of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. Trump and his allies continue to raise the issue, while he also criticized former FBI Director James Comey and others involved in the Russia probe. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, particularly as the Russia investigation has intensified. He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the probe and claims he has the absolute right to direct government investigations himself. END OF SUMMARY.
