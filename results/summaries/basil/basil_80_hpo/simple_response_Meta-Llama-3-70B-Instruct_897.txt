SUMMARY:

President Trump has once again launched a scathing attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the imprisonment of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump also demanded action against James Comey, the former FBI Director, and reiterated his claim that he has the right to direct government investigations himself. This is not the first time Trump has sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI, as he has repeatedly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Trump's actions are a clear attempt to politicize the justice system and undermine the rule of law.

END OF SUMMARY.
