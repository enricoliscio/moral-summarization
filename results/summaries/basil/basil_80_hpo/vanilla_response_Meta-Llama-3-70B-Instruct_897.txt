SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's early-morning tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails by the State Department, which showed that she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump also demanded action against former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired in May. This is not the first time Trump has criticized the Justice Department and FBI, as he has repeatedly sought to undermine them as the Russia probe has intensified. Trump has also claimed that he has the right to direct government investigations himself, despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from supervising the Russia investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
