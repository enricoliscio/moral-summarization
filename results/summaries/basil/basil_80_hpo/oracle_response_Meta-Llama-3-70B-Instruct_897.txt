SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the Justice Department, labeling it as the "deep state" and calling for the jailing of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump's tweet was in response to the release of Abedin's emails, which showed she had forwarded State Department emails, including some with passwords, to her personal account. Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified, claiming he has the "absolute right" to direct government investigations himself. He has also criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, in which Trump's campaign is accused of colluding with Russia to influence the election. Trump's actions have raised concerns about his attempts to exert influence over the Justice Department and its investigations.
