Okay, I need to summarize this article about President Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Trump is talking about an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, which is currently guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. He claims the U.S. is the only country with this, but the article mentions at least 30 others do too. He's making this move before the midterm elections to energize his base.

There's opposition from within his own party, like House Speaker Ryan, who says you can't change the Constitution via executive order. Trump's advisors might be citing a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports restricting immigration.

The article also mentions that changing the 14th Amendment requires a constitutional amendment, which is a lengthy process. Some conservatives argue the amendment was meant for citizens and legal residents, not undocumented immigrants. Michael Anton, a former Trump spokesman, wrote that birthright citizenship is a misinterpretation and an executive order could change it.

But legal scholars say Trump can't do it unilaterally, and doing so would lead to legal challenges. The article also notes that Trump's move comes amid other election-season actions, like deploying troops to the border and new rules discouraging immigrants from using public benefits.

Opposition includes civil rights groups calling it unconstitutional and ethnic cleansing. Some Republicans also oppose it, seeing political risks. The article references a Supreme Court case from 1898 affirming citizenship for children born in the U.S., and experts argue that ending birthright citizenship would create second-class citizens and increase illegal immigration.

So, the summary needs to cover Trump's plan, the constitutional issues, opposition, and the implications. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include key points like the 14th Amendment, opposition from Ryan, the legal challenges, and the potential consequences.

I should structure it by first stating Trump's proposal, then the constitutional basis, opposition from Ryan, the argument that it can't be done via executive order, the historical context with the 1898 case, and the reactions from different groups.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence covers a main point without going into too much detail. I'll also need to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee under the 14th Amendment. Despite opposition from within his party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who argued such a change requires a constitutional amendment, Trump claims his legal team believes it can be done via executive order. Critics, including legal scholars and civil rights groups, argue this would be unconstitutional and create second-class citizens. The move comes amid election-season efforts to energize Trump's base, alongside other immigration enforcement actions. END OF SUMMARY.
