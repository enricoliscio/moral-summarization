SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a long-accepted constitutional guarantee in the United States. This move is being seen as an attempt to appeal to his anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm congressional elections. However, the idea has faced swift pushback, including from some members of his own party, who argue that it is obviously unconstitutional and would require a lengthy amendment process. There is consensus among legal scholars that the 14th Amendment, which states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens," cannot be overridden by presidential action. Despite this, Trump and his allies are eager to test the waters with this executive order, which they believe will specify that the children of noncitizens are not citizens. This proposal has been called "ethnic cleansing" and is seen as illegal and offensive, exacerbating racial tensions and driving further polarization. According to a study, doing away with birthright citizenship would also be counterproductive, as it would lead to a doubling of the unauthorized population in the United States by 2050. The moral framing in this article centers around the words and concepts of constitutionality, legality, and the moral implications of denying citizenship and creating a group of second-class citizens.
