Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President Trump proposing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is a big deal because it's protected by the 14th Amendment. 

First, I should identify the main points. Trump claims the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship, but that's false since other countries like Canada and Mexico also have it. He wants to change this, but legal experts say he can't do it with an executive order because it would require a constitutional amendment. 

I also need to include the moral arguments. Trump and his supporters argue it's about following the Constitution correctly, but opponents see it as creating second-class citizens and increasing polarization. There's also the political angle with midterm elections approaching, and some Republicans are against this idea.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start with Trump's proposal, mention the false claim, the legal challenges, the political motivations, and the opposing views. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications on both sides.

Let me structure it: introduce Trump's plan, the false claim, the legal stance, the 14th Amendment, the political context, and the moral debate. Make sure to include the quotes or references to experts and the potential consequences.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. Also, preserve the original moral framing, so I shouldn't take sides but present both perspectives.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is the only country granting citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. This assertion is false, as at least 30 other nations, including Canada and Mexico, offer similar protections. Trump's plan faces legal challenges, as the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., and constitutional amendments cannot be overturned by executive order. Critics argue this move would create second-class citizens and deepen polarization, while supporters, like Vice President Pence, suggest the Supreme Court could reinterpret the Amendment. Trump's proposal comes amid midterm elections, aiming to galvanize his anti-immigrant base. Legal experts and advocates warn the move would be unconstitutional and harmful, with some Republicans also opposing it. END OF SUMMARY.
