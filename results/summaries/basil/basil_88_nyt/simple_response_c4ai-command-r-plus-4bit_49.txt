SUMMARY: President Trump is considering an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a long-standing constitutional guarantee in the United States. This move is part of his efforts to appeal to his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections. However, this claim has been deemed false as at least 30 other countries also grant automatic birthright citizenship. The idea has been met with pushback from some in his own party, legal scholars, and immigrant advocacy groups, who argue that it is unconstitutional and would create a permanent group of second-class citizens. The 14th Amendment states that all persons born or naturalized in the US are citizens and cannot be overridden by presidential action. Some conservatives argue that the amendment was meant only for citizens and legal permanent residents, not unauthorized immigrants. The White House Counsel's Office has advised Trump that he can make the change with an executive order, but the legality of such a move is unclear. This discussion comes amid other dramatic claims by Trump, such as promising an unlikely 10% tax cut for the middle class, and his deployment of troops to the southern border. The idea of ending birthright citizenship has been criticized as unconstitutional and counterproductive, with some arguing that it would lead to a significant increase in the unauthorized population.
