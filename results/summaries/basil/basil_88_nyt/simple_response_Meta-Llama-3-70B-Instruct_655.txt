SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order that would nullify birthright citizenship in the United States, a move that has been met with swift pushback from some in his own party. Trump claims that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants, but this is a false claim, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies. Trump's plan has been criticized as an attempt to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment and has been called "ethnic cleansing" by some civil rights groups. Legal scholars argue that Trump cannot unilaterally change the Constitution and that such an order would be illegal and prompt legal challenges. The move is seen as a desperate attempt to appeal to Trump's base ahead of the midterm elections, but it has sparked outrage among civil rights groups and has been rejected by some Republicans.
