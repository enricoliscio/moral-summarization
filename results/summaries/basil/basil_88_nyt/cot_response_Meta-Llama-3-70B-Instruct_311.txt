SUMMARY:
President Trump is preparing an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a "ridiculous" and "absurd" move that has sparked outrage among civil rights groups. The idea has been called "ethnic cleansing" by some, and is widely seen as "illegal", "offensive", and "unconstitutional". Trump's plan has been met with swift pushback from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who argues that the president cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. The move is seen as a bid to energize Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections, but critics argue it would "exacerbate racial tensions" and "drive further polarization" across the country. Instead, they call for "compassionate comprehensive immigration reform" that promotes "unity" and "inclusion". END OF SUMMARY.
