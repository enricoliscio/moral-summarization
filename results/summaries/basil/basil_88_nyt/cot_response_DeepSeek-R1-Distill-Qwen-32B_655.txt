Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article and identify all the single words that carry moral connotations. These words often express judgments or values. 

Looking at the text, words like "ridiculous," "false claim," "pushback," "controversial," "misreading," "absurdity," "illegal," "discourage," "outrage," "ethnic cleansing," "unconstitutional," "exacerbate," "polarization," "equality," "second-class," "jurisdiction," "principle," "counterproductive," "diversity," "compassionate," "common sense," and "unjust" stand out as morally framed.

Now, I'll craft a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Trump's executive order plan, the constitutional debate, the pushback from within his party, and the moral and legal criticisms. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications like the potential for second-class citizens and the clash with the 14th Amendment's principles of equality.

I should structure the summary to start with Trump's announcement, mention the constitutional basis, the opposition from Ryan and others, the legal scholars' consensus, the comparison to Obama's actions, the administration's troop deployment, and the criticism from advocacy groups. I'll conclude with the political risks and the broader implications of the proposal.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the moral framing present in the original article. I'll check each sentence to include the relevant moral terms and maintain the critical tone towards Trump's proposal.

**MORAL SUMMARY:**

President Trump has proposed an executive order to revoke birthright citizenship, sparking controversy and criticism. Critics argue this move would create a "second-class" citizenry, violating the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equality. Legal experts and political allies, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, assert that such a change requires constitutional amendment, not an executive order. Trump's suggestion has faced "outrage" from civil rights groups, who view it as "unconstitutional" and "counterproductive," potentially exacerbating racial tensions. The proposal, part of Trump's strategy to energize his base, has been met with "pushback" even within his party, highlighting political risks. Advocates emphasize that denying citizenship based on parents' status contradicts the principle of equality enshrined in the Constitution.
