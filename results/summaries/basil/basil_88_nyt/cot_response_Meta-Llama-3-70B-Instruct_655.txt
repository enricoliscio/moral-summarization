SUMMARY:
President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a "ridiculous" and "absurd" move that has sparked widespread criticism. The order would deny citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants, a move that has been deemed "unconstitutional" and "illegal" by many legal scholars. Critics argue that this would lead to "ethnic cleansing" and create a permanent group of "second-class citizens." The proposal has been met with outrage from civil rights groups, with some calling it "offensive" and "exploitative." Republicans, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have also pushed back against the idea, citing the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. The move is seen as a desperate attempt to appeal to Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections, and has been criticized for promoting "polarization" instead of "unity" and "inclusion."
