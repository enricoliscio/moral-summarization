SUMMARY:

President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order that would nullify the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship, a move that has been met with swift pushback from even his own party. Trump falsely claimed that the US is the only country that grants automatic birthright citizenship, when in fact, at least 30 other countries do so. House Speaker Paul Ryan argued that the president cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order, citing the 14th Amendment. Trump's plan has been deemed illegal and offensive by civil rights groups, who argue that it would exacerbate racial tensions and create a permanent group of second-class citizens. The move is seen as an attempt to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that scrapping birthright citizenship would be counterproductive to the stated goals of those who rail against illegal immigration, as it would lead to a significant increase in the unauthorized population.
