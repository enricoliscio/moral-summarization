SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to issue an executive order that would eliminate birthright citizenship in the United States, a move that has sparked widespread criticism and legal concerns. Trump falsely claimed that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to anyone born within its borders, when in fact at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar laws. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the US, and legal scholars argue that Trump cannot unilaterally change this provision. Even some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have spoken out against the idea, citing its unconstitutionality. Civil rights groups have condemned the proposal as "ethnic cleansing" and "illegal and offensive," arguing that it would create a permanent underclass of second-class citizens and exacerbate racial tensions. The move is seen as a desperate attempt to appeal to Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections.
