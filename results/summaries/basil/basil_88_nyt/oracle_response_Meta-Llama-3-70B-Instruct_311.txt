SUMMARY:

President Trump plans to issue an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee, claiming it's "ridiculous" and needs to end. However, this move has been met with swift pushback from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who argues that the president cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. Legal scholars agree that Trump cannot unilaterally change the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the US. The move has been deemed "ethnic cleansing" by immigrant advocacy groups and "illegal" and "offensive" by civil rights organizations. Republicans have also rejected Trump's suggestion, citing the importance of unity and inclusion. Experts argue that ending birthright citizenship would be counterproductive, leading to a significant increase in the unauthorized population. The plan has been criticized for exacerbating racial tensions, exploiting fears, and driving further polarization across the country.
