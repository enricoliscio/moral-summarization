SUMMARY:
President Trump plans to issue an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a "ridiculous" and "absurd" move that has sparked outrage among civil rights groups. Trump claims that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants, but this is a false claim. At least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies. Trump's plan has been met with swift pushback from some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who argues that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Critics have called the idea "ethnic cleansing" and "offensive", and argue that it would exacerbate "racial tensions" and drive further "polarization" across the country. The move is seen as a bid to energize Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
