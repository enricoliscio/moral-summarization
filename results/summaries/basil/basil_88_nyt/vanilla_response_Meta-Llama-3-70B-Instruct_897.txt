SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order that would end birthright citizenship in the US, claiming that the country is the only one in the world where a person can come in and have a baby, and the baby is automatically a US citizen. However, this claim is false, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, grant automatic birthright citizenship. Trump's plan has been met with pushback from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who says that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Legal scholars also agree that Trump cannot do so without a lengthy constitutional process. The 14th Amendment states that all persons born or naturalized in the US are citizens, and amendments to the Constitution cannot be overridden by presidential action. Trump's plan has been criticized by civil rights groups, who call it "ethnic cleansing" and say it would create a permanent group of second-class citizens.
