SUMMARY:

President Trump plans to issue an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a move that has sparked swift pushback from some in his own party. Trump falsely claimed that the US is the only country that grants automatic birthright citizenship, when in fact, at least 30 other countries do so. House Speaker Paul Ryan argued that the president cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order, citing the 14th Amendment's clear language. Legal scholars agree that Trump cannot unilaterally change the Constitution, and any attempt to do so would prompt legal challenges. Vice President Mike Pence argued that the Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the 14th Amendment applies to people in the country illegally. Critics have labeled the idea as "ethnic cleansing" and "illegal," saying it would exacerbate racial tensions and create a permanent group of second-class citizens. Some Republicans have also rejected the proposal, calling it "wrong" and advocating for compassionate comprehensive immigration reform. END OF SUMMARY.
