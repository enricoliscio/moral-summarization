SUMMARY:

President Trump announced plans to issue an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US, claiming it's "ridiculous" and needs to end. However, this move has been met with swift pushback from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the US, and attempting to change this would likely prompt legal challenges. Vice President Mike Pence argued that the Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the amendment applies to children of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue that ending birthright citizenship would be unconstitutional, offensive, and counterproductive to the stated goals of reducing illegal immigration. Some Republicans also rejected the idea, citing the importance of diversity and the need for comprehensive immigration reform. END OF SUMMARY.
