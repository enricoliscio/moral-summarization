Alright, I need to summarize this article about President Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Trump wants to use an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, which is currently guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. He claims the U.S. is the only country with this, but the article says at least 30 others do too. That's an important point to include.

He made this announcement before the midterm elections, trying to energize his base. Some in his own party, like Paul Ryan, disagree, saying he can't do it via executive order. They believe it requires a constitutional amendment, which is a much longer process.

The 14th Amendment clearly states that anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, so changing that would need Congress or a constitutional convention. Trump's advisors argue it's possible through an executive order, but legal experts say it's unlikely.

The article also mentions the 1898 Supreme Court case about Wong Kim Ark, which affirmed birthright citizenship. Critics argue Trump's plan would create second-class citizens and increase polarization. Advocacy groups are against it, calling it unconstitutional and offensive.

Some Republicans oppose it too, showing political risks for the party. The article ends by noting that Trump's move is part of a pattern of attention-grabbing actions before the elections.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on Trump's plan, the constitutional issues, opposition, and implications. Make sure to mention the 14th Amendment, the opposition from Ryan and others, and the potential legal challenges. Also, include the critics' arguments and the political context.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's announcement, mention the constitutional guarantee, his claim vs reality, opposition from Ryan, the legal experts' view, the 1898 case, critics' arguments, and the political implications.

I should keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without going over the word limit. Make sure to highlight that the plan is controversial and faces significant legal and political hurdles.

SUMMARY: President Trump has announced plans to issue an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee under the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Trump claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, though at least 30 others, including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic birthright citizenship. His proposal has faced opposition, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that ending birthright citizenship via executive order is unconstitutional. Legal experts agree that amending the 14th Amendment would require a constitutional process, not an executive order. Trump's allies argue the 14th Amendment may not apply to undocumented immigrants, but critics warn the move would create a class of second-class citizens and increase polarization. Advocacy groups and some Republicans have condemned the idea as unconstitutional and counterproductive. Trump's announcement comes amid efforts to energize his base ahead of midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
