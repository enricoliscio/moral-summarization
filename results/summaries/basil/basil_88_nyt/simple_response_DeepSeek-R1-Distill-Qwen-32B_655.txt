Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump wanting to end birthright citizenship. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. I should make sure to capture the key points and the ethical implications discussed.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Trump is proposing an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. He claims the U.S. is unique in this, but the article points out that other countries also grant it. There's opposition from within his own party, like Paul Ryan, who says it can't be done via executive order. Legal scholars agree that Trump can't do it unilaterally, and it would require a constitutional amendment.

The article also mentions that Trump's move is part of his strategy to energize his base before the midterms. Critics argue it's unethical and would create second-class citizens. Some conservatives argue the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to undocumented immigrants, but legal experts disagree. The summary should include the moral arguments on both sides.

I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, then the constitutional context, opposition, and the moral debate. I should also mention the potential consequences and the political strategy behind it.

Let me make sure I include all these elements without getting too bogged down in details. The focus is on the moral framing, so I'll highlight the arguments about unity, inclusion, and the impact on immigrants. Also, note that Trump's advisors support his claims, but there's significant pushback.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's concise and captures the moral aspects as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is the only country where children born to immigrants automatically gain citizenship. However, at least 30 other nations, including Canada and Mexico, grant similar rights. Trump's plan faces legal and political opposition, as the 14th Amendment clearly grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and legal scholars argue that changing this would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive order. Trump's allies, like Vice President Pence, suggest testing the idea in court, but critics warn it would create second-class citizens and deepen racial divisions. Advocates for immigration rights argue that ending birthright citizenship would undermine the nation's unity and inclusion, while conservatives claim it would address illegal immigration. Trump's move, part of his midterm election strategy, has sparked outrage, with some calling it "ethnic cleansing." The proposal highlights a clash between constitutional principles and political polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
