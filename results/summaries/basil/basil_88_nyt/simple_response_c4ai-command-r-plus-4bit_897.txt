SUMMARY: President Trump plans to issue an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming that it is a ridiculous concept that needs to end. This has sparked moral outrage and pushback from both Democrats and Republicans, who argue that it is unconstitutional and would create a permanent group of second-class citizens. The 14th Amendment of the Constitution grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States, and it cannot be overridden by presidential action without a lengthy constitutional process. Legal scholars argue that Trump's plan is based on a misreading of the amendment and would be counterproductive to reducing illegal immigration. The idea has been called "ethnic cleansing" and offensive, and it remains to be seen if Trump will actually take this action or if it is just a maneuver to appeal to his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
