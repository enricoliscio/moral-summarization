SUMMARY:

President Trump announced plans to issue an executive order that would nullify birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee in the United States, claiming it's "ridiculous" and "has to end." However, this false claim has been met with swift pushback from even his own party, with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan stating that the president "obviously" cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. The idea has been deemed illegal and offensive by civil rights groups, with Kristen Clarke calling it "ethnic cleansing." The proposal would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears, and drive further polarization across the country. It would also create a permanent group of second-class citizens and invite litigation. The consensus among legal scholars is that Trump cannot unilaterally change the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States. The move is seen as an attempt to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections.
