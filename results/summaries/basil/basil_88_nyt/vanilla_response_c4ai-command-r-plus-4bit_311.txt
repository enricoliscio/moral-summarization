SUMMARY: President Trump has stated his intention to issue an executive order that would revoke the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States. This move is seen as an attempt to appeal to his anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections. However, legal scholars and some members of his own party argue that such an order would be unconstitutional and require a lengthy constitutional process to amend the 14th Amendment. The amendment grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the US and subject to its jurisdiction. Some conservatives argue that it should only apply to citizens and legal permanent residents. Trump's proposal has been criticized by immigrant advocacy groups and some Republicans as offensive and counterproductive. The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the 14th Amendment applies to undocumented immigrants, but a previous ruling affirmed the citizenship of a person born in the US to Chinese parents residing there. Ending birthright citizenship could lead to a significant increase in the unauthorized population by 2050.
END OF SUMMARY.
