SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order that would end birthright citizenship in the US, claiming that it is "ridiculous" and "has to end." However, this move has been met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that the President cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Legal scholars also agree that the President cannot override the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the US. The idea has been floated before, but it is unclear how serious Trump is about taking action. The move is seen as an attempt to energize his anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that ending birthright citizenship would be unconstitutional, offensive, and would lead to a permanent group of second-class citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
