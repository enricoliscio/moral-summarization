SUMMARY:
President Trump's latest attention-grabbing maneuver is to nullify the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship, a move that is deemed "ridiculous" and "absurd" by many. Trump claims that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants, but this is a false claim. At least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies. Trump's plan has been met with swift pushback from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who says that the president cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. Critics argue that such a move would be "unconstitutional", "illegal", and "offensive", and would lead to "ethnic cleansing" and "polarization". The proposal has been called "outrageous" by civil rights groups, and would create a permanent group of second-class citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
