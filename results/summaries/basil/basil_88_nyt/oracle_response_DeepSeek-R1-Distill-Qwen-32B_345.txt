Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship through an executive order, which he claims is supported by his legal team. He argues that the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to anyone born here, but in reality, many countries do the same. 

The article mentions that Trump's advisors and some legal scholars believe this would require a constitutional amendment, which is a lengthy process. There's opposition from within his own party, like House Speaker Ryan, who says Trump can't do this by executive order. The article also notes that Trump's move is part of his strategy to energize his base before the midterm elections. 

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like "false," "grant," "study," "eviscerate," "abuse," "illegal," "absurdity," "offensive," "unconstitutional," "cleansing," "polarization," "unity," "inclusion," "wrong," "compassionate," and "unauthorized" are key here. 

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's claims, the legal and political opposition, the implications of his proposal, and the moral arguments against it. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from Trump's announcement to the reactions and consequences.

I'll start by stating Trump's plan, then mention the false claim about other countries. Include the legal stance that it can't be done via executive order. Then, note the political motivations and the opposition from within his party and civil rights groups. Highlight the moral and legal arguments against the proposal, including the potential for polarization and the impact on unity. Finally, conclude with the implications for immigration policy and the potential legal challenges.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward, ensuring all key moral terms are included without making the summary too verbose. Let me draft this step by step, checking each point and the inclusion of the required words.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants. However, this is a false claim, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic citizenship. Trump’s plan faces swift pushback, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that the 14th Amendment is clear and cannot be altered by executive order. Legal scholars agree that changing birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive action. Trump’s proposal has been called absurd, offensive, and unconstitutional by critics, who argue it would create second-class citizens and exacerbate racial tensions. Civil rights groups, including Families Belong Together and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, have condemned the idea as ethnic cleansing and a violation of the 14th Amendment’s principle of equality. Some Republicans, like Bob Hugin, have also criticized the plan, calling it wrong and advocating for compassionate immigration reform. Trump’s move is seen as an attempt to energize his anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections, though legal challenges and political risks remain significant. END OF SUMMARY.
