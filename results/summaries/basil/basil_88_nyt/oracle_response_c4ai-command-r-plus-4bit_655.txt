SUMMARY: President Trump is preparing an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming that it is a "ridiculous" concept that needs to end. However, this claim has been proven false, as at least 30 other countries grant automatic birthright citizenship. The move has been met with pushback, even from some members of his own party, who argue that it is clearly unconstitutional and would require a lengthy constitutional process to amend. The consensus among legal scholars is that Trump cannot unilaterally override the 14th Amendment, which states that all persons born or naturalized in the US are citizens. 

Trump's plan has been criticized as offensive and illegal, exacerbating racial tensions and creating a permanent group of second-class citizens. Immigration advocates argue that birthright citizenship is a vital principle and that removing it would be counterproductive to reducing illegal immigration. A study by the Migration Policy Institute found that denying citizenship to children with unauthorized parents would double the unauthorized population by 2050. Despite this, Trump's allies are eager to test the idea in the Supreme Court, arguing that the 14th Amendment has never been ruled on in this specific context. 

Trump's discussion of this idea comes as his administration has taken other anti-immigrant actions, such as sending troops to the southern border and proposing a rule to deny green cards to immigrants who use social safety net services. The move has been criticized as ethnic cleansing and an attempt to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections.
