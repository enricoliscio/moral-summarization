SUMMARY: President Trump has sparked controversy by stating that he intends to nullify birthright citizenship in the United States through an executive order. This statement is false and has been deemed by many as a naked abuse of power to appeal to his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans have rejected this idea, stating that it is obviously unconstitutional and would require a lengthy constitutional process to change. 

Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump, arguing that the Supreme Court has never ruled on the specific application of the 14th Amendment to illegal immigrants. However, legal scholars and immigration advocates argue that birthright citizenship is a vital principle and that doing away with it would be immoral, unethical, and counterproductive. They argue that it would create a group of second-class citizens and invite litigation. Furthermore, it would exacerbate racial tensions and offend those who cherish the language of the 14th Amendment. 

Trump's discussion of this idea follows other recent controversial executive actions, including sending troops to the southern border and changing the rules to deny green cards to legal immigrants who use social safety net services. The immoral, unethical, and offensive nature of these actions has been highlighted by civil rights groups, who see them as a racist attempt to discourage immigration and create fear.
END OF SUMMARY.
