Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump proposing an executive order to end birthright citizenship. He claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, which is false because other countries like Canada and Mexico also have it. Trump's advisors and some legal scholars argue that this can't be done via executive order because it would require amending the 14th Amendment, which is a lengthy constitutional process. There's opposition from within his own party, like Paul Ryan, who says Trump can't do this without Congress. Some conservatives argue that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to undocumented immigrants, but legal experts say it does. The article also mentions that this move could create second-class citizens and increase polarization. Civil rights groups are calling it ethnic cleansing and unconstitutional. Trump's actions are seen as an attempt to energize his base before the midterm elections.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words, using as many of the provided moral terms as possible. I should include words like "false," "grant," "study," "eviscerate," "abuse," "jurisdiction," "illegally," "vote," "convention," "authorization," "misreading," "absurdity," "clarification," "services," "assistance," "medicaid," "cleansing," "illegal," "offensive," "unconstitutional," "executive," "exacerbate," "tensions," "fears," "polarization," "unity," "inclusion," "places," "equal," "strips," "create," "litigation," "wrong," "compassionate," "immigration," "unauthorized," "reach," "double," "charged," "crimes," "disobey."

I'll structure the summary to cover Trump's proposal, the false claim, opposition, legal challenges, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to include the key points and the moral framing words without making it too long. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all important aspects are covered concisely.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, falsely claiming the U.S. is the only country granting it. This move, aimed at energizing his anti-immigrant base before midterms, faces legal and political opposition. Critics argue it would require amending the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all born in the U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasized the constitutional process needed, comparing it to Obama's contested immigration actions. Some conservatives claim the amendment doesn't apply to undocumented immigrants, but legal experts disagree. The proposal, seen as ethnic cleansing by civil rights groups, would create second-class citizens and exacerbate tensions. Trump's advisors suggest it could energize his base, despite legal challenges and potential polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
