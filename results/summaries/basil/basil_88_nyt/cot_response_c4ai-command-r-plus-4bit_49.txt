SUMMARY: President Trump has stated his intention to issue an executive order that would nullify birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming that it is "ridiculous" and that the country is the only one that grants automatic citizenship to those born within its borders. This claim has been refuted, with at least 30 other countries offering similar guarantees. Trump's plan has faced opposition from some members of his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that the President "obviously" cannot overturn the 14th Amendment with an executive order. Legal scholars and immigration advocates argue that such a move would be illegal and offensive, creating a group of "second-class citizens" and inviting litigation. The idea has been called an "abuse of power" and "ethnic cleansing," with some Republicans also rejecting the suggestion as morally and legally wrong. Trump's administration has also taken other steps to deter immigration, including sending troops to the southern border and proposing to deny green cards to immigrants who use social safety net services. Critics argue that these actions are exacerbating racial tensions and that birthright citizenship is a vital principle that should be upheld. The President's attempt to unilaterally overturn birthright citizenship would face significant legal challenges and would likely require a lengthy constitutional process. The outcome of this moral and legal debate remains uncertain.
