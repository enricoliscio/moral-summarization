SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order that would revoke birthright citizenship, a long-accepted constitutional guarantee in the United States. This move is seen as a desperate attempt to energize his anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm congressional elections. However, this plan has been met with swift pushback from even some in his own party, who argue that it is unconstitutional and would require a lengthy constitutional process. Legal scholars agree that the president cannot unilaterally revoke birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. The move has been criticized as "ethnic cleansing" and "illegal and offensive" by immigrant advocacy groups, and would likely lead to legal challenges. The proposal is seen as a morally reprehensible attempt to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment and would have severe consequences, including creating a permanent group of second-class citizens.
