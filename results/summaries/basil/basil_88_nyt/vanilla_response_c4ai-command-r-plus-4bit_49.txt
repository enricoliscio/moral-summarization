SUMMARY: President Trump stated his intention to sign an executive order that would revoke the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming that it is a privilege unique to the country. This statement has been met with opposition from both sides of the political spectrum, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stated that the President cannot nullify birthright citizenship by executive order. Vice President Mike Pence defended the idea, arguing that the Supreme Court has never ruled on the specific application of the 14th Amendment to illegal immigrants. Legal scholars and immigration advocates argue that such an order would be unconstitutional and counterproductive, as it would create a permanent group of second-class citizens and lead to a doubling of the unauthorized population by 2050. The White House has not provided clarification on the legal grounds for the proposed executive order, and some Republicans have rejected the suggestion, highlighting the political risks associated with stoking anti-immigrant sentiment. The idea of ending birthright citizenship has been a recurring theme in Trump's presidency, but the legality and practicality of such a move remain highly contested.
