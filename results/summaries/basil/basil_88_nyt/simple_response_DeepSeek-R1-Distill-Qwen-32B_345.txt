Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about President Trump wanting to end birthright citizenship via an executive order. He's doing this before midterms to energize his base. He claims the US is the only country with this, but that's false since others like Canada and Mexico do too. Trump's plan faces opposition from even his own party, like Paul Ryan, who says it's unconstitutional and would require a constitutional amendment. Trump's lawyers now say it can be done with an executive order, which is a shift from his initial belief.

There's a mention of the 14th Amendment and how it's been interpreted, including a Supreme Court case in 1898. Some conservatives argue it doesn't apply to undocumented immigrants, but legal scholars say Trump can't do it unilaterally. The article also notes that Trump is making this move along with other immigration actions, which some see as stoking fear and division. Critics argue it's unconstitutional and harmful, while Trump's allies think it's worth testing in court.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral elements. The key points are Trump's plan, the constitutional issues, opposition from his party, the legal challenges, and the broader implications like unity and rights. I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these elements while highlighting the moral and legal debates.

I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, then the constitutional basis, opposition, and the implications. I'll make sure to include that it's seen as dividing and that some find it offensive. Also, note that Trump's own party is against it, showing political risks.

Let me structure it: Trump's plan, constitutional issues, opposition, legal challenges, and the moral implications. Keep it clear and within the word limit. Make sure to mention the 14th Amendment, the executive order aspect, and the criticism from both within and outside the party.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring all key points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a move that would revoke the constitutional guarantee of citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. Trump claims the U.S. is unique in granting automatic citizenship, though at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, do the same. His plan faces legal and political challenges, as the 14th Amendment explicitly grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans oppose the idea, stating it would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive order. Trump's advisers now argue it could be done via executive order, a claim criticized as legally unsound. Critics, including civil rights groups, argue the proposal is unconstitutional, divisive, and harmful, potentially creating a class of second-class citizens. Trumpâ€™s move, part of a broader push to energize his anti-immigrant base before midterms, has drawn accusations of stoking fear and polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
