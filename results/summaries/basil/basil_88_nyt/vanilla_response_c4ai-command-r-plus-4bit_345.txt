SUMMARY: President Trump stated his intention to sign an executive order that would revoke birthright citizenship for children born in the US to non-citizens, claiming that the US is the only country with such a policy. This claim is false, as at least 30 other countries grant automatic birthright citizenship. The proposal has faced opposition from some members of Trump's own party, who argue that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which grants citizenship to those born in the US, cannot be overridden by an executive order. Legal scholars agree that the president does not have the authority to revoke birthright citizenship unilaterally. Vice President Mike Pence, however, has argued that the Supreme Court has never ruled specifically on the issue of birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. The proposal has also been criticized by immigrant advocacy groups as illegal, offensive, and a form of ethnic cleansing. Some Republicans have also rejected the suggestion, highlighting the importance of diversity and the need for comprehensive immigration reform. The 14th Amendment states that all persons born or naturalized in the US are citizens, and amendments to the Constitution cannot be overridden by presidential action. Despite this, Trump claims that the White House Counsel's Office has advised him that he can revoke birthright citizenship through an executive order.
END OF SUMMARY.
