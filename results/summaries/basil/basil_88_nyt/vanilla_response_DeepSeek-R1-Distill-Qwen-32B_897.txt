Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

President Trump wants to end birthright citizenship with an executive order. He claims the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to anyone born here, but that's not true since other countries do it too. The 14th Amendment is the key here, stating that anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen. Trump's advisors and some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, say he can't change this with an executive order because it requires a constitutional amendment. Trump's team thinks they can bypass this, possibly testing it in the Supreme Court. Critics argue this would create second-class citizens and increase polarization. Some conservatives and legal scholars debate the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, but the consensus is Trump can't do it alone. The article also mentions Trump's other immigration actions, like sending troops to the border and discouraging immigrants from using public benefits, which have drawn criticism.

So, the summary needs to cover Trump's proposal, the constitutional basis, opposition, and implications. I'll keep it under 200 words, focusing on the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, arguing the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to anyone born on its soil. However, at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic citizenship. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., and legal scholars agree Trump cannot override it with an executive order, as constitutional amendments require congressional or state action. Trump's plan has faced criticism from within his party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who emphasized the need to follow the Constitution. Critics argue ending birthright citizenship would create second-class citizens and increase polarization. Some conservatives argue the 14th Amendment was intended only for legal residents, but the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this interpretation. Trump's proposal comes amid midterm elections, as he seeks to energize his base with immigration-focused policies. END OF SUMMARY.
