SUMMARY: President Trump said he is preparing an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming that the country is the only one that grants automatic citizenship to children born on its soil. This statement is false, as at least 30 other countries have similar policies. Trump's plan has been met with criticism and pushback from some members of his own party, legal scholars, and immigrant advocacy groups, who argue that it would be unconstitutional and create a permanent group of second-class citizens. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States, and it can only be changed through a lengthy constitutional process involving overwhelming majorities in Congress or the states. Despite this, Trump claims that he can overturn birthright citizenship with an executive order, based on advice from the White House Counsel's Office. The idea of ending birthright citizenship has been controversial, with some Republicans and immigration advocates arguing that it would be counterproductive and lead to a larger unauthorized population in the country.
