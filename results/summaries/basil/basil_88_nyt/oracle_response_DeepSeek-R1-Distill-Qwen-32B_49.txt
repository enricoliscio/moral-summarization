Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should include as many as possible. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and structured clearly.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is proposing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is unique, though other countries also grant it. He's doing this before midterms to energize his base. There's opposition from within his party, like Paul Ryan, who says it's unconstitutional. Trump's advisors argue it's possible, but legal scholars say it's unlikely. The 14th Amendment is key here. Critics argue it's illegal, offensive, and would create second-class citizens. Supporters, like Michael Anton, claim it's a misreading of the amendment.

Now, I'll identify the morally charged words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like "false," "grant," "study," "eviscerate," "abuse," "illegal," "unconstitutional," "offensive," "cleansing," "absurdity," "polarization," "unity," "inclusion," etc.

I need to structure the summary to cover Trump's proposal, the constitutional basis, opposition, and the implications. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate, like calling Trump's claim "false," and describing the opposition as "illegal" and "offensive."

I'll start by stating Trump's proposal, mention the false claim, then the constitutional argument. Include Ryan's opposition, Trump's advisors' stance, and the legal scholars' consensus. Then touch on the 14th Amendment, the Wong Kim Ark case, and the implications of the proposal. End with the criticism and the potential polarization.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary terms without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is the only country granting citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants, a false assertion. At least 30 countries, including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic citizenship. Trump's plan faced opposition, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating it cannot be done via executive order, as it violates the 14th Amendment. Trump's advisors argued it was possible, but legal scholars disagreed. The 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., cannot be overridden by executive action. Critics, including immigration advocates, called the proposal unconstitutional, offensive, and a form of "ethnic cleansing," arguing it would create second-class citizens. Some conservatives, like Michael Anton, argued the 14th Amendment was misread and should not apply to undocumented immigrants. Trump's move, part of his midterm strategy to energize his base, has been criticized as an abuse of power, exacerbating racial tensions and polarization. The proposal has also been rejected by some Republicans, highlighting its political risks. END OF SUMMARY.
