SUMMARY: President Trump stated his intention to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship in the United States, arguing that it encourages illegal immigration. This move has been met with criticism and pushback from both Republicans and legal scholars, who argue that it would require a constitutional amendment, not an executive order. House Speaker Paul Ryan and others have stated that the 14th Amendment is clear in granting citizenship to those born in the US and under its jurisdiction. Vice President Mike Pence, however, claims that the Supreme Court has never ruled on the matter. The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to appeal to his anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections. Legal scholars and immigration advocates argue that ending birthright citizenship would be counterproductive and create a permanent group of second-class citizens. A study by the Migration Policy Institute predicts that without birthright citizenship, the unauthorized population in the US would double by 2050. Critics also point out that Trump's claim that the US is the only country with birthright citizenship is false, with at least 30 other countries granting automatic citizenship.
