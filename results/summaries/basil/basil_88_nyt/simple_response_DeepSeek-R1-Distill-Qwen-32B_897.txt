Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses President Trump's plan to nullify birthright citizenship through an executive order. He claims the U.S. is the only country with this policy, but that's false since many others do. Trump's advisors and legal team are suggesting he can do this without a constitutional amendment, but legal scholars say it's unlikely. There's opposition from within his party, like Paul Ryan, who says it's not possible via executive order. The 14th Amendment is key here, and some conservatives argue it doesn't apply to undocumented immigrants. Trump's move is part of his strategy to energize his base before midterms, despite the political and legal risks. Critics argue it's unconstitutional and harmful to unity.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral perspective. I should highlight Trump's claim, the factual correction, legal challenges, opposition, and the implications on unity and constitutionality.

I'll start by stating Trump's plan, mention the false claim, then note the legal and political opposition. Include the 14th Amendment, the debate around it, and the criticism from advocates. Conclude with the political strategy and risks.

Make sure the summary is concise and captures the moral framing, such as unity and constitutional principles.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a move that has sparked controversy and legal debate. Trump claims the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants, though at least 30 other countries do the same. His plan faces opposition, including from within his own party, as legal experts argue that changing the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., requires a constitutional amendment, not an executive order. Trump’s advisors suggest he can bypass this, but the move is widely seen as unconstitutional. Critics, including immigration advocates, argue that ending birthright citizenship would create a class of second-class citizens and harm national unity. Trump’s proposal, part of his efforts to energize his anti-immigrant base ahead of midterms, has been criticized as politically risky and legally flawed. END OF SUMMARY.
