Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump wanting to end birthright citizenship through an executive order. He claims the U.S. is the only country where someone can come in, have a baby, and that baby becomes a citizen, but that's not true because other countries like Canada and Mexico also have birthright citizenship. Trump's advisors and some in his party, like Paul Ryan, say he can't do this with an executive order because it's tied to the 14th Amendment, which requires a constitutional process. Trump's lawyers now say he can do it with an executive order, but legal experts say that's unlikely. Some conservatives argue the 14th Amendment shouldn't apply to undocumented immigrants, but the Supreme Court hasn't ruled on that. Trump's move is part of his strategy to energize his base before the midterms, along with other dramatic claims like a middle-class tax cut. Critics, including immigration advocates and some Republicans, oppose this idea, calling it unconstitutional and harmful. The article also mentions that denying citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants could increase the unauthorized population in the future.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's plan, mention the constitutional issues, the opposition, and the implications. I should keep it concise but cover all key points: the executive order, the 14th Amendment, opposition from within his party, legal challenges, and the impact on immigration.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants. However, at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, also offer birthright citizenship. Trump's plan faces legal challenges, as the 14th Amendment requires a constitutional process to change, which cannot be done via executive order. House Speaker Paul Ryan and legal experts argue Trump lacks the authority to do so. Trump's lawyers now claim it's possible, but this stance is controversial. Some conservatives argue the 14th Amendment shouldn't apply to undocumented immigrants, though the Supreme Court has not ruled on this. Trump's move aims to energize his base ahead of midterms, alongside other dramatic claims. Critics, including immigration advocates and some Republicans, oppose the idea, calling it unconstitutional and harmful. Denying citizenship could increase the unauthorized population, according to experts. END OF SUMMARY.
