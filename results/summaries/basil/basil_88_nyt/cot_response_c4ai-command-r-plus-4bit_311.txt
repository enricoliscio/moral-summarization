SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming it is "ridiculous" and that the country is the only one that offers such a right. This claim is false, as at least 30 other countries have similar laws. The proposal has been met with moral outrage and has been deemed "offensive" and "ethnic cleansing" by immigrant advocacy groups. The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to appeal to his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections. Legal scholars and even some Republicans argue that the plan is unconstitutional and an "abuse" of presidential power. The 14th Amendment grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States and cannot be overridden by an executive order. The proposal is also immoral and would create a group of second-class citizens, exacerbating racial tensions and inviting litigation. The idea has been called "wrong" and "racist", and there are concerns that it would lead to further polarization and exploitation of fears. Some argue that it would be counterproductive and would double the unauthorized population by 2050. The proposal raises serious moral questions about equality, unity, and inclusion. 

END OF SUMMARY.
