Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump wanting to end birthright citizenship. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about Trump's plan, the legal issues, and the reactions from different groups. I should make sure to include the key points: Trump's claim, the 14th Amendment, the opposition from Ryan, the legal scholars' consensus, and the moral implications from both sides. Also, mention the pushback from civil rights groups and some Republicans. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all the main aspects. Let me start by identifying the main sections: Trump's announcement, the legal challenges, reactions, and the moral debate. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's proposal, then the legal and political pushback, followed by the moral arguments, and end with the implications. I should avoid any markdown and just use plain text. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, ensure that the moral framing is clear, highlighting both the supporters and opponents' viewpoints. Okay, I think I have a good outline. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump has proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is the only country granting citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. This claim is false, as at least 30 other countries do the same. Trump’s plan faces legal and political challenges, as the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., and constitutional changes require congressional or state action, not an executive order. House Speaker Paul Ryan and legal scholars oppose the idea, arguing it would require a lengthy constitutional process. Trump’s allies, however, argue the 14th Amendment may not apply to undocumented immigrants, citing a 1898 Supreme Court case. Civil rights groups and some Republicans, like Bob Hugin, have condemned the proposal as unconstitutional, unethical, and counterproductive, warning it would create a class of second-class citizens and deepen polarization. Trump’s move, ahead of midterms, aims to energize his anti-immigrant base but faces significant legal and political hurdles. END OF SUMMARY.
