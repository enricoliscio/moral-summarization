SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order that would eliminate birthright citizenship in the United States, a move that would nullify a long-accepted constitutional guarantee. Trump claims that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil, but this is false - at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar laws. Trump's plan has been met with pushback from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who argues that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Legal scholars agree that Trump cannot make such a change without a constitutional amendment or Congressional action. The move is seen as an attempt to energize Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that the plan is unconstitutional, offensive, and would lead to a permanent group of second-class citizens.
