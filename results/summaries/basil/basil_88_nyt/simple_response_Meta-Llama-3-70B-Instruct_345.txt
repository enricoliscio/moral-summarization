SUMMARY:

President Trump plans to sign an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming it's "ridiculous" and that the US is the only country with this policy. However, this is a false claim, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, grant automatic birthright citizenship. Trump's plan has been met with pushback from even his own party, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Legal scholars agree that Trump cannot do so without a lengthy constitutional process. The idea has been called "ethnic cleansing" by immigrant advocacy groups, and many Republicans have rejected the suggestion, citing the importance of diversity and the need for compassionate immigration reform. The move is seen as an attempt to energize Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections.
