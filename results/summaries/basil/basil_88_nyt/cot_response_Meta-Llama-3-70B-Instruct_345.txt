SUMMARY:
President Trump plans to issue an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a "ridiculous" and "absurd" move that has sparked widespread criticism. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the US, but Trump claims it's a "ridiculous" policy that needs to end. However, legal scholars and even some Republicans argue that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. The idea has been met with swift pushback, with critics calling it "ethnic cleansing" and "illegal". Civil rights groups argue that it would "exploit fears" and drive "polarization" across the country, rather than promoting "unity" and "inclusion". The move is seen as a desperate attempt to appeal to Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
