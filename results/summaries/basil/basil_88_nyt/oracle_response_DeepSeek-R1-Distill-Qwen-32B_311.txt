Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The article is about President Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship through an executive order, which is a significant constitutional issue. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Trump claims the U.S. is unique in granting birthright citizenship, but it's factually incorrect. He wants to change this via executive order, which legal experts say isn't possible. There's opposition from within his party, like Paul Ryan, who emphasizes the Constitution's 14th Amendment. Trump's advisors and some conservatives argue the amendment doesn't apply to undocumented immigrants, but this is a misreading. The proposal is seen as ethnic cleansing and unconstitutional, with potential legal challenges. It's part of Trump's strategy to energize his base before midterms.

Now, I need to include as many of the author's morally framed words as possible: false, grant, eviscerate, abuse, jurisdiction, illegally, vote, convention, authorization, misreading, absurdity, clarification, services, assistance, Medicaid, cleansing, illegal, offensive, unconstitutional, executive, exacerbate, tensions, fears, polarization, unity, inclusion, places, equal, strips, create, litigation, wrong, compassionate, immigration, unauthorized, reach, double, charged, crimes, disobey.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's false claims, the pushback from legal and political figures, the constitutional issues, and the moral implications like ethnic cleansing and polarization. I'll make sure to use the listed words where appropriate without making the summary too long, aiming for under 200 words.

Let me draft this, ensuring each moral term is included where it fits naturally. I'll start by stating Trump's false claim, then mention the study and opposition. Include Ryan's points on the Constitution, Trump's advisors' misreading, the 1898 Supreme Court case, and the legal scholars' consensus. Then address the political strategy, the potential for litigation, and the moral objections like ethnic cleansing and polarization. Conclude with the opposition from immigration advocates and the implications for unity.

I need to make sure each sentence flows logically and all key points are covered succinctly. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump has proposed an executive order to eviscerate birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee under the 14th Amendment, falsely claiming the U.S. is unique in granting it. This move, part of his strategy to energize his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections, has faced swift pushback. House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasized the constitutional process required to change birthright citizenship, comparing it to Obama's contested immigration actions. Trump's advisors argue the 14th Amendment was misread, but legal scholars agree he cannot unilaterally revoke citizenship. The proposal, seen as ethnic cleansing and unconstitutional, would create second-class citizens and exacerbate racial tensions. Immigration advocates warn it would increase polarization and harm unity, while some Republicans, like Bob Hugin, have called the idea wrong, advocating for compassionate immigration reform. The plan, which lacks legal clarity, risks litigation and further divides the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
