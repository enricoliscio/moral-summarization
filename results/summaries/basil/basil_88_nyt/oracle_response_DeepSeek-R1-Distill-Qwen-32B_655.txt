Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words from the article as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article is about President Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship through an executive order. He claims the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants, which he believes is unfair. The moral framing here includes words like "false," "grant," "study," "eviscerate," "abuse," "illegal," "absurdity," and "cleansing." These words carry strong moral connotations, so I need to include them where appropriate.

I should note that Trump's claim is factually incorrect because several countries do grant birthright citizenship. The article also mentions opposition from within his own party, like Paul Ryan, who argues that changing the 14th Amendment requires a constitutional process, not an executive order. This brings in terms like "constitutionally" and "illegal."

The article also discusses the potential legal and social implications, such as creating second-class citizens and exacerbating racial tensions. Terms like "unconstitutional," "offensive," and "polarization" are used here. Additionally, there's opposition from advocacy groups who call the idea "ethnic cleansing" and "illegal," emphasizing the moral wrongness of the proposal.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral terms and captures the essence of the debate: Trump's argument, the counterarguments from legal and political perspectives, and the societal implications. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Trump's proposal, mention the false claim, the opposition from Ryan and others, the legal impossibility via executive order, the social and moral implications, and the criticism from advocacy groups. I'll ensure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

I should avoid introducing new information not in the article and keep the tone neutral but reflective of the moral arguments presented. Also, I need to make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point coherently.

Alright, putting it all together, making sure each sentence includes the relevant moral terms and captures the key points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump proposed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants—a false claim, as at least 30 other countries do so. His plan faced swift pushback, including from House Speaker Paul Ryan, who argued that changing the 14th Amendment via executive order is unconstitutional and would require a lengthy constitutional process. Trump’s allies, like Vice President Mike Pence, suggested testing the idea in the Supreme Court, though legal scholars widely agree it cannot be done unilaterally. Critics, including immigration advocates, argue the proposal would create second-class citizens, exacerbate racial tensions, and violate the principles of unity and inclusion. The idea was also condemned as "ethnic cleansing" and "illegal," with opponents emphasizing the constitutional and moral implications of stripping citizenship. Trump’s proposal, part of his effort to energize his anti-immigrant base ahead of midterms, faces significant legal and political hurdles. END OF SUMMARY.
