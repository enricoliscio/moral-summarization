SUMMARY: President Trump is preparing an executive order to nullify the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship, a move that has been criticized as an attention-grabbing maneuver to activate his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections. The order would end the long-standing practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States, which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment. Trump argues that the US is "the only country in the world" with such a policy, which is false. The proposal has been met with swift pushback, including from some Republicans, who argue that it is wrong, offensive, and unconstitutional. Legal scholars and immigration advocates agree that Trump's plan is illegal and would be counterproductive, leading to an increase in the unauthorized population. The move is part of a series of dramatic, ethnically charged claims made by Trump in the lead-up to the midterms, including the deployment of troops to the southern border and a proposal to deny green cards to legal immigrants who use social safety net services. Critics argue that Trump is exacerbating racial tensions and creating a permanent group of second-class citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
