SUMMARY: President Trump announced he is preparing an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a long-accepted constitutional guarantee in the United States. This statement, made just days before midterm congressional elections, is part of his attempt to appeal to his anti-immigrant base by vowing to clamp down on immigration. Trump falsely claimed that the US is the only country that grants automatic birthright citizenship, when in fact, at least 30 other countries do so. The idea has been met with swift pushback, including from some members of his own party, who argue that the President cannot unilaterally eviscerate birthright citizenship as it is protected by the 14th Amendment. The amendment states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens." Legal scholars and immigration advocates argue that attempting to deny citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants would be unconstitutional, counterproductive, and would create a permanent group of second-class citizens. The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment among his base ahead of the upcoming elections. However, some Republicans have rejected the suggestion, recognizing the importance of diversity and the need for compassionate comprehensive immigration reform. The proposal has been called offensive and illegal, exacerbating racial tensions and driving polarization in the country.
