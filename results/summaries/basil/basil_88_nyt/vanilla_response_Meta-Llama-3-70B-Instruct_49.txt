SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order that would end birthright citizenship in the United States, claiming that the current policy is "ridiculous" and allows children of undocumented immigrants to become citizens. However, this claim is false, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, grant automatic birthright citizenship. Trump's plan has been met with opposition from some in his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who argues that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Legal scholars also agree that Trump cannot end birthright citizenship through an executive order, as it would require a constitutional amendment or action by Congress. The move is seen as an attempt to energize Trump's anti-immigrant base ahead of the midterm elections, and has been criticized by civil rights groups and some Republicans as illegal, offensive, and counterproductive.
