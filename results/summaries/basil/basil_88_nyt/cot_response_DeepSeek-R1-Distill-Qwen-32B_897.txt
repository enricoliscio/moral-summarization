Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. They mentioned to do this in STEP 1, listing each word with a *. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "ridiculous," "absurdity," "citizenship," "illegal," "unconstitutional," "polarization," "discrimination," "activating," "anti-immigrant," "equality," "inclusion," "unity," "second-class,"
