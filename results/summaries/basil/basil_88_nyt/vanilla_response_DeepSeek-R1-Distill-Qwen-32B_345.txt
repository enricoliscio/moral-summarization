Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship. Let me read through the article to understand the main points.

First, Trump is preparing an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, which he claims is unique to the US. But the article mentions that at least 30 other countries also have this. He made this announcement before the midterm elections to energize his base. 

Next, there's opposition from within his own party. House Speaker Paul Ryan says it's not possible through an executive order and would require a constitutional amendment. Trump's advisors, like Vice President Pence, suggest it might be tested in the Supreme Court, but legal scholars don't think it's possible.

The article also talks about the 14th Amendment, which clearly states that anyone born in the US is a citizen. Changing this would need a constitutional amendment, which is a lengthy process. Trump's White House Counsel now says it can be done with an executive order, but there's no confirmation on the legal grounds.

There's also pushback from civil rights groups and some Republicans, who argue it's unconstitutional and harmful. The article references a 1898 Supreme Court case supporting birthright citizenship. Trump's move is part of his strategy to energize his base before the elections.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, highlighting Trump's plan, the opposition, the constitutional issues, and the implications. I should make sure to mention the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Trump is considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming the U.S. is unique in granting citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants. However, at least 30 other countries also offer birthright citizenship.

Trump's advisors suggest testing it in the Supreme Court, but legal scholars doubt its feasibility. Civil rights groups and some Republicans have criticized the plan as unconstitutional and harmful. Trump's move aims to energize his base ahead of midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
