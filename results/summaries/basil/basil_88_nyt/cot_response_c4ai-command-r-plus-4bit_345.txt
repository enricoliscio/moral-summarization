SUMMARY: President Trump is considering an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship in the United States, a move that has sparked moral outrage and legal concerns. The order would be based on the false claim that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to children born on its soil. Trump's plan has been criticized as an *abusive* power grab, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that the President "obviously" cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. The idea has also been called *undocumented*, as it contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the US. Vice President Mike Pence argued that the Supreme Court has never ruled on the specific issue of birthright citizenship for children of *undocumented* immigrants. The proposal has been labeled as *illegal* and *offensive* by civil rights groups, who argue that it would *exacerbate* racial tensions and create a permanent group of *second-class* citizens. The move would also *strip* millions of people of their citizenship and *invite* litigation. Some Republicans have also rejected the suggestion, with one calling it "wrong" and another labeling it "*ethnic* *cleansing*." The order would be a dramatic shift in US policy and is likely to face significant moral, legal, and political opposition.
