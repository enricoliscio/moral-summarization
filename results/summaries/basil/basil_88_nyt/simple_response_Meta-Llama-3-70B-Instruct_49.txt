SUMMARY:

President Trump announced plans to issue an executive order to end birthright citizenship, claiming that the US is the only country that grants automatic citizenship to children born to non-citizens. However, this claim is false, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies. Trump's plan has been met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who argue that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Legal scholars agree that Trump's plan is unconstitutional and would prompt legal challenges. The move is seen as an attempt to appeal to his base and energize anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that ending birthright citizenship would lead to a permanent group of second-class citizens, exacerbate racial tensions, and drive further polarization across the country.
