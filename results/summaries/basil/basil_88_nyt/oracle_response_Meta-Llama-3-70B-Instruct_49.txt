SUMMARY:

President Trump plans to issue an executive order to nullify birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee in the United States. He claims that the current system is "ridiculous" and allows people to take advantage of benefits for 85 years. However, this claim is false, as at least 30 other countries, including Canada and Mexico, grant automatic birthright citizenship. Trump's plan has been met with pushback from some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who argue that the president cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. Legal scholars agree that Trump cannot unilaterally change the Constitution, and attempting to do so would prompt legal challenges. Critics have called the idea "ethnic cleansing," "illegal," and "offensive," arguing that it would exacerbate racial tensions and create a permanent group of second-class citizens. The proposal has sparked outrage among civil rights groups and has been rejected by some Republicans, highlighting the political risks of Trump's bid to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment. END OF SUMMARY.
