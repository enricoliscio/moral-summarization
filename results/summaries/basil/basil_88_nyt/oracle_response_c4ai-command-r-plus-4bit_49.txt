SUMMARY: President Trump has made an attention-grabbing claim that he plans to nullify the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States through an executive order. This has been met with swift backlash, including from some members of his own party, who argue that such an action would be an abuse of power and eviscerate a vital principle. Legal scholars and immigration advocates argue that Trump's plan is based on a false interpretation of the 14th Amendment and would be unconstitutional. The amendment states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens," and cannot be overridden by a presidential executive order. The move is seen as an attempt to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment and appeal to his base ahead of the midterm elections, with some calling it "ethnic cleansing." The proposal has also been criticized as offensive and exacerbating racial tensions and polarization in the country. It is unclear how serious Trump is about the action, but it follows other dramatic claims and anti-immigrant executive actions in the lead-up to the midterms. The plan has been rejected by legal scholars and some Republicans, who argue that it is wrong and would have negative consequences for the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
