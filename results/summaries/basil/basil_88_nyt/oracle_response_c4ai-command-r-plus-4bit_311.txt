SUMMARY: President Trump is planning to issue an executive order that would nullify the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship, a move that has been met with swift pushback, including from some members of his own party. The order would be based on the false claim that the US is the only country that grants automatic birthright citizenship, when in fact, at least 30 other countries have similar laws. The consensus among legal scholars is that Trump cannot unilaterally overturn the 14th Amendment, which states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens." House Speaker Paul Ryan stated that such a move would require a lengthy constitutional process and compared it to an abuse of presidential power. Doing away with birthright citizenship has been pitched by Trump in the past and is supported by some conservatives, who argue that the 14th Amendment was meant only for citizens and legal permanent residents. However, immigration advocates argue that this would be counterproductive and would do away with a vital principle. The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to appeal to voters by stoking anti-immigrant sentiment and making dramatic claims with little chance of materializing. The proposal has been called offensive and unconstitutional by civil rights groups, and it is unclear how serious Trump is about taking action.
