SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked a political firestorm and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejects claims that the law sanctions discrimination and says he will introduce legislation to clarify its intent. The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Critics argue that the law could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Businesses and governments have announced a halt to business with the state, and thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse. The controversy has cast a shadow over preparations for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament in Indianapolis.
