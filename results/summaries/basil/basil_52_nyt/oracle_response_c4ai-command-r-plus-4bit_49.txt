SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash and protests over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue discriminates against gays and lesbians by allowing businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. Governor Pence has rejected these assertions, stating that the law is about protecting religious liberty. He plans to clarify the intent of the law through additional legislation. However, critics note that Indiana's law differs from similar laws in other states and that gays and lesbians are not a protected class in Indiana. The backlash has caused some businesses and governments to halt or abandon plans in the state, casting a shadow over the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Governor Pence is also facing a political dilemma as he considers running for re-election or seeking the presidency in 2016.
