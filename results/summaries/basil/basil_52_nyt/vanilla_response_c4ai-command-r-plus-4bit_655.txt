SUMMARY: Indiana Governor Mike Pence faces backlash after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. The law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs but has been criticized for potentially allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence defended the law, citing similar federal legislation and stating that it was not about discrimination. However, critics note that Indiana's law includes different wording and that the state does not protect gays and lesbians as a protected class. Pence has said he will not seek these protections. Thousands protested the law, and businesses and governments have halted travel and business with Indiana. Some companies have also abandoned expansion plans in the state. The law has also cast a shadow over the NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence has said he will seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law but has not offered details.
END OF SUMMARY.
