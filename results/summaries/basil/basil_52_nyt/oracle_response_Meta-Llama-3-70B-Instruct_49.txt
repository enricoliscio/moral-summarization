SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence remains committed to the law, which he claims is about protecting religious liberty, not discrimination. However, he has not directly answered whether the law would protect a Christian vendor who denies service to a same-sex couple. The law has led to a halt in business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, with companies like Salesforce.com and Angie's List announcing boycotts. The mayor of Seattle has also banned city employees from traveling to Indiana for work. Critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Pence has rejected calls to seek protections for gays and lesbians, saying it's not on his agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
