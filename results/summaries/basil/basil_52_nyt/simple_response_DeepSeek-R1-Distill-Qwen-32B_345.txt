Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Mike Pence and the religious freedom law in Indiana. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about the backlash against the law, Pence's defense, and the reactions from various groups. The moral framing seems to center around religious freedom versus discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is emphasizing religious liberty, while critics argue the law could enable discrimination.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main points: Pence's stance, the purpose of the law, the clarification he's seeking, the protests and business reactions, and the broader implications like the NCAA's concern. Also, the moral debate between religious freedom and anti-discrimination protections is crucial.

I should structure the summary to highlight Pence's position, the opposition's arguments, and the consequences of the law. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I need to be concise but cover all essential aspects.

Let me start by outlining the key points:
1. Pence defends the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying it's about protecting religious beliefs.
2. Critics argue it allows discrimination against gays and lesbians.
3. Pence wants to clarify the law to address misunderstandings.
4. Businesses and governments are reacting negatively, affecting Indiana's economy.
5. The NCAA is concerned about the law's impact on their events.
6. The law doesn't protect gays and lesbians, which is a point of contention.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include these points while maintaining the moral perspective. I'll need to balance both sides of the argument as presented in the article.

Wait, the user also mentioned to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start after "SUMMARY:". I should make sure to format it correctly without any markdown, just plain text.

I should also check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Let me count as I write to stay within the limit.

Hmm, I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me read through it again to ensure clarity and that the moral framing is preserved. It's important that the summary reflects both Pence's defense of religious freedom and the critics' concerns about discrimination.

Alright, I think that's a solid summary that meets the user's requirements. Time to put it all together.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana defended the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed last week, stating it protects individuals and businesses from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. Critics argue the law could enable discrimination against gays and lesbians, a claim Pence denies, asserting it is about religious liberty, not discrimination. Pence plans to seek legislative clarification to address misunderstandings. The law has sparked backlash, with businesses like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List halting operations in Indiana, and the NCAA expressing concern over its implications. Pence emphasized the law’s roots in federal legislation and similar state laws, but critics note Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians, unlike other states. Pence rejected adding such protections, stating it’s not his priority. The controversy has become a political challenge for Pence, who is considering a 2016 presidential run. END OF SUMMARY.
