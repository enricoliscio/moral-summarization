SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence has announced plans to clarify the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and protests. The law, signed last week, aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. Critics argue it could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denied the law sanctions discrimination, but did not directly answer whether it would protect a Christian vendor who refused service to a gay couple. The backlash has led to businesses and governments halting travel to Indiana, and the NCAA expressing concern about the law's implications. Pence is seeking legislation to clarify the law's intent, but has rejected calls to add protections for sexual orientation. The controversy has become a political headache for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016.
