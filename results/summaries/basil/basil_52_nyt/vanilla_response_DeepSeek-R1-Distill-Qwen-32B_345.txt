Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Governor Mike Pence and the religious freedom law in Indiana. They provided the article, and they want the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about Pence addressing a political backlash over the law he signed. He wants to clarify the law's intent, saying it's about religious freedom, not discrimination. There are protests, business boycotts, and it's affecting events like the NCAA tournament. Critics argue the law could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians, and Pence isn't adding protections for them. 

I should structure the summary to include the key elements: Pence's response, the law's intent, the backlash, business reactions, and the political implications. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. 

I should start by stating that Pence is addressing criticism over the law, then mention his plan to clarify it. Then, note the protests and business actions against the law. Include the NCAA's concern. Also, highlight the criticism about potential discrimination and Pence's stance on not adding protections. 

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points without going into too much detail. I'll also need to check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. 

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the main action: Pence addressing criticism. Then his clarification efforts. Next, the backlash with examples like Salesforce and Angie's List. Mention the NCAA's concern. Then, the critics' arguments and Pence's response. Finally, the political impact on his career. 

I think that covers all the essential points succinctly. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and to the point. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY:  
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is addressing criticism over a new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law, signed last week, protects religious freedom and is not about discrimination, though he acknowledges the need for legislative clarification. Protests and business boycotts have emerged, with companies like Salesforce and Angie’s List halting operations in Indiana. The law has also drawn concern from the NCAA, which is evaluating its implications for future events. Critics argue the law could enable discrimination, especially since Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence has ruled out adding such protections, stating it’s not his priority. The backlash has become a political challenge for Pence, who is weighing a re-election or presidential bid.  
END OF SUMMARY.
