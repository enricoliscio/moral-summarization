SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing a political backlash over the state's new religious freedom law, which critics argue could sanction discrimination against gays and lesbians. The governor, who signed the bill into law last week, has rejected these assertions and stated that he will seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, which is to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. Despite Mr. Pence's defense of the law, citing similar legislation at the federal level and in other states, opponents argue that Indiana's law includes different wording that could enable wider discrimination. They also note that gays and lesbians are not a protected class in Indiana, and the governor has stated he will not seek these protections. The backlash has led to businesses and governments halting or abandoning plans in the state, with thousands protesting at the Statehouse. Mr. Pence is now caught between running for re-election or pursuing a presidential bid in 2016, juggling the need to defend the law while also clarifying its intent to those who do not understand it.
END OF SUMMARY.
