SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the negative reactions, Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. However, he acknowledged the need for clarification and promised to introduce legislation to address concerns. The law has sparked widespread protests, with businesses and governments announcing boycotts of the state. Even Republican supporters, like Bill Oesterle, have spoken out against the law. The governor's stance has been criticized for not providing protections for sexual orientation, unlike many other states with similar laws. Pence's refusal to consider adding these protections has only fueled the controversy. The debate has put a spotlight on the governor's political future, as he weighs a run for re-election or the presidency in 2016.
