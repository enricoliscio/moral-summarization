Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Governor Pence signed a Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana, which has caused a lot of backlash. People are saying it allows discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law, saying it's about religious liberty, not discrimination. There are protests, and some businesses are halting travel to Indiana. The NCAA is concerned about the implications for their events. Pence is considering his political future, maybe running for president, but this is causing him problems. Critics argue the law could lead to more discrimination since Indiana doesn't have protections for gays and lesbians.

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words: discrimination, offered, liberty, service, halt, ban, abandon, open, protected, protections, agenda.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning Pence's response, the law's intent, the backlash, business reactions, the NCAA's concern, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate.

I should start with the governor addressing the backlash, then mention the law's intent, the protests, business actions like halting and banning travel, the abandonment of deals, and the opening for discrimination. Then touch on the protected classes and lack of protections, and Pence's agenda regarding not adding those protections.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine some points. Maybe something like: Pence faces backlash over the law, which aims to protect religious liberty but critics say it allows discrimination. Protests and business actions like halting travel and banning trips. Companies abandoning deals. The law could open discrimination, but Indiana doesn't protect gays, and Pence isn't adding that to his agenda.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral words. Let me check the word count as I go. I think that's a solid approach.

SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash over the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law protects religious liberty and is working to clarify its intent, though he did not directly address whether it could allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples. Protests have erupted, with thousands gathering at the Statehouse, and businesses like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List have halted or abandoned plans to operate in Indiana. The NCAA also expressed concern over the law’s implications. Pence defended the law, citing its roots in federal legislation, but critics argue it could open the door to broader discrimination. Indiana does not protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law, and Pence has ruled out adding such protections to his agenda. The controversy has become a political headache as Pence considers his next move—running for re-election or president in 2016. END OF SUMMARY.
