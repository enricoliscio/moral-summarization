SUMMARY:
Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked a political firestorm and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejected claims that the law sanctions discrimination, saying it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Critics argue that the law could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Pence defended the law, citing its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by 19 other states. However, he did not directly answer whether the law would protect a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple, instead asking if tolerance is a two-way street. The controversy has led to a halt in business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, and has cast a shadow over preparations for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament. END OF SUMMARY.
