Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Governor Mike Pence and the religious freedom law in Indiana. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Pence is addressing a political firestorm over the new law. He wants to clarify its intent and says it doesn't sanction discrimination against gays and lesbians. He was surprised by the negative reactions and plans to introduce clarifying legislation. The law aims to protect individuals or companies from actions that burden their religious beliefs. Proponents say it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal issues. Pence supports the law but is discussing with legislative leaders to clarify it.

On ABC's "This Week," he defended the law, saying it's not a mistake and that they'll explain it better. He didn't directly answer if it protects a florist refusing service to a gay couple, instead talking about tolerance being a two-way street. There were protests, and businesses like Salesforce and Angie’s List halted operations in Indiana. The NCAA is concerned about the law's impact on their events and workforce.

Pence is facing backlash, which is an unexpected political issue as he considers re-election or a presidential run. He points out the law is based on federal legislation and one Obama supported. Critics argue the Indiana law could allow more discrimination and that sexual orientation isn't protected in Indiana, unlike other states. Pence refuses to add those protections.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Pence's response to the backlash, the law's intent, the clarifications he's seeking, the business reactions, the NCAA's concern, and the political implications. Also, mention the criticism about discrimination and his refusal to expand protections.

Let me structure it: Start with Pence addressing the backlash, mention the law's intent, the clarifications, business reactions, NCAA's concern, political impact, and the criticism about discrimination and protections. Keep each point concise.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without going into too much detail. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Indiana Governor Mike Pence is addressing backlash over a new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics claim allows discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law, signed last week, protects religious freedom and is not about discrimination, though he acknowledges the need for clarification. Proponents argue it shields Christian vendors from legal repercussions for refusing service to same-sex couples. Despite this, businesses like Salesforce and Angie’s List have halted operations in Indiana, and the NCAA expressed concern over the law’s impact on events. Pence, facing political pressure, has not ruled out seeking re-election or a presidential bid, while critics highlight the law’s potential for broader discrimination and note Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians. Pence has rejected adding such protections, emphasizing the law’s roots in federal legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
