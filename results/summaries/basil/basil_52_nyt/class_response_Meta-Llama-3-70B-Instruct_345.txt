SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. However, he did not directly answer whether the law would protect a Christian florist who refused service to a gay couple, instead asking if "tolerance is a two-way street or not?" Thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse, and several businesses and governments announced a halt to business with the state, citing concerns over discrimination. Pence rejected calls to seek protections for sexual orientation, saying it's "not on my agenda." The debate has cast a shadow over the upcoming N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament in Indianapolis, with the organization expressing deep concern over the legislation.
