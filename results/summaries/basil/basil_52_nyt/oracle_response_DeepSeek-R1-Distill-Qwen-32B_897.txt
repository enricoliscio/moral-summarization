Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Gov. Mike Pence. There's a lot of backlash against the law, with people accusing it of allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent, saying it's about religious liberty, not discrimination. He mentions that the law is similar to ones signed by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but critics argue it's broader and could lead to more discrimination since Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law.

The article also talks about the consequences, like businesses halting travel to Indiana, and the impact on events like the NCAA tournament. Pence is facing a political dilemma, considering re-election or a presidential run, and the backlash is a headache for him.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: discrimination, offered, liberty, service, halt, ban, abandon, open, protected, protections, agenda. I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between religious freedom and discrimination, the reactions from businesses and the public, and Pence's stance and political situation.

I'll start by introducing the law and the criticism, then mention Pence's clarification efforts. Next, I'll note the business reactions and the impact on events. Finally, I'll address the political implications for Pence. I'll make sure to use the moral words naturally within the summary without forcing them.

Let me draft it concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well. I need to balance between being informative and concise, while keeping the moral elements prominent.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash over the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue could sanction discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence has vowed to seek legislation clarifying the law’s intent, emphasizing religious liberty, but has rejected claims it permits discrimination. The law aims to protect individuals or businesses from actions that burden their religious beliefs, potentially allowing Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples. Pence defended the law, comparing it to federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and a version Obama supported as a state senator. However, critics argue Indiana’s law could open the door to broader discrimination, as the state does not protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Businesses like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List have halted or abandoned plans involving Indiana, while cities like Seattle have banned city-funded travel there. The backlash has cast a shadow over the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence, weighing re-election or a presidential run, has not committed to adding protections for gays and lesbians, stating it’s not on his agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
