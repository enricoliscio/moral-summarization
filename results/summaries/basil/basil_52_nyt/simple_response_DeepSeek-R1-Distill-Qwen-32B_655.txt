Alright, so the user has provided a detailed news article about Governor Mike Pence and the religious freedom law in Indiana. They want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture both the governor's stance and the criticism.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Pence signed the law, which aims to protect religious freedom, but it's causing a backlash because people think it allows discrimination against gays and lesbians. He's trying to clarify the law's intent, saying it's about religious liberty, not discrimination. But critics argue it could lead to more discrimination since Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law.

I should structure the summary to include Pence's defense, the reactions from businesses and the public, and the criticism from opponents. It's important to highlight the moral debate between religious freedom and anti-discrimination protections.

I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements: Pence's clarification efforts, the law's intent, the backlash, business reactions, and the underlying moral conflict. Also, mention the political implications for Pence, like his possible run for president.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and concise. Make sure to include that Pence won't add protections for gays and lesbians, which is a crucial point in the moral argument.

Okay, putting it all together, I'll start with Pence addressing the backlash, his clarification efforts, the law's intent, the business reactions, the criticism, and the political context. That should cover all the necessary points within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash over a recently enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence defended the law, stating it aims to protect religious freedom, not sanction discrimination. He acknowledged the negative reaction and hinted at legislative clarifications to address concerns. Proponents argue the law would allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. However, critics, including businesses and political leaders, argue the law could enable broader discrimination, especially since Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence rejected adding such protections, saying it was not his priority. The controversy has sparked protests, business withdrawals, and political fallout, with Pence facing questions about the law's implications and his potential 2016 presidential bid.  

END OF SUMMARY.
