SUMMARY: Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked a political firestorm over concerns it sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejects claims that the law promotes discrimination, instead framing it as a matter of religious liberty. However, critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. In response to the controversy, businesses and governments have announced a halt to business with the state, with some even imposing a ban on travel to Indiana. Pence has refused to consider adding protections for gays and lesbians, saying it's not on his agenda. The debate has cast a shadow over preparations for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament, with the organization expressing deep concern over the legislation's implications. END OF SUMMARY.
