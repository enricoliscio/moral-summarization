SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence remains committed to the law, which he claims aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. However, critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. In response to the controversy, several businesses and governments have halted or banned travel to Indiana, citing concerns over discrimination. Pence has rejected calls to seek protections for gays and lesbians, stating that it's not on his agenda. The debate has cast a shadow over preparations for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament in Indianapolis, with the organization expressing deep concern over the legislation's implications.
