SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked controversy and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. However, he acknowledged that the law's wording may need to be clarified to address concerns. Pence rejected assertions that the law sanctions discrimination, but did not directly answer whether it would protect a Christian vendor who denies service to a gay couple. The law has led to widespread criticism, with several businesses and governments announcing a halt to business with the state and city of Indianapolis. The NCAA has also expressed concern, and thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse over the weekend.
