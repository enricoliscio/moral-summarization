Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral implications.

The article is about Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Governor Mike Pence. There's a lot of controversy around it. Pence says he's surprised by the negative reactions and wants to clarify the law's intent. He supports religious liberty but doesn't want it to be seen as sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. He mentions that the law aims to protect individuals or companies from actions that burden their religious beliefs. Proponents argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions.

On the other hand, critics argue that the law could enable discrimination. There are protests, businesses halting travel to Indiana, and even the NCAA expressing concern about the implications for their events. Pence is in a tough spot politically, considering a run for president or re-election, and the backlash is a headache for him.

Moral framing here is about religious freedom versus discrimination. Pence and supporters see it as protecting religious rights, while opponents see it as enabling discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. The author presents both sides but seems to highlight the negative reactions and the potential for discrimination, which leans towards the moral argument against the law.

I need to capture this in a concise summary, making sure to include the key points: Pence's stance, the clarification attempt, the impact on discrimination, the backlash from businesses and the NCAA, and the political implications for Pence. Also, the moral conflict between religious freedom and discrimination is central.

Let me structure the summary to first introduce the law and Pence's position, then the reactions, and finally the broader implications. I'll make sure to mention the opposing views on the law's intent and the consequences it's causing.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but cover all the essential elements. Also, I need to preserve the moral framing, so I'll highlight both the religious freedom aspect and the discrimination concerns.

Alright, I think I have a good grasp on the key points and the moral angle. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

He plans to seek legislative clarification but has not provided details. The law allows individuals or businesses to refuse services based on religious beliefs, sparking protests and business boycotts, including from Salesforce.com, Seattle, and Angie’s List. The NCAA also expressed concern about the law’s impact on future events. Pence defended the law, citing its roots in federal legislation, but critics argue it differs from other states’ laws, potentially allowing broader discrimination.
