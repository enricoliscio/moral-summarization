SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence claims the law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs, but critics argue it could be used to refuse service to same-sex couples. Despite the backlash, Pence defends the law, saying it's not about discrimination, but rather about tolerance being a two-way street. However, he failed to directly answer whether the law would protect a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple. The law has led to protests, boycotts, and bans on travel to Indiana, with many businesses and governments halting operations in the state. Pence's attempts to clarify the law's intent come as he faces a political firestorm that could impact his potential presidential bid in 2016.
