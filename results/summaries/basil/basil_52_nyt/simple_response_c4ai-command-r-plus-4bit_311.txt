SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana faces backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denies that the law sanctions discrimination and asserts that it protects religious liberty. He plans to introduce legislation clarifying the intent of the law, but rejects calls to include protections for sexual orientation in the state's civil rights law. The law has sparked protests and led to businesses and governments halting travel and business with the state. The controversy has caused an unexpected headache for Pence, who is considering a run for president in 2016. Critics argue that the Indiana law differs from similar laws in other states and could enable wider discrimination. Pence defends the law by noting its origins in federal legislation signed by President Clinton and supported by President Obama when he was a state senator. The debate overshadows preparations for the NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis.
END OF SUMMARY.
