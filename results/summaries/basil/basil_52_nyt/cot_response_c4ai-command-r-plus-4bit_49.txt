SUMMARY:
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing a moral firestorm over a religious freedom law enacted last week. The law, known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, aims to protect individuals and companies from taking actions that burden their religious beliefs. Critics argue that it sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians, allowing vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. Pence has rejected these assertions, stating that the law is about tolerance and should not be misused to discriminate. However, he has been criticized for not directly addressing specific scenarios where the law might be applied. Thousands have protested the law, and businesses have halted travel to Indiana, with some companies even abandoning expansion plans in the state. The backlash has put Pence in a difficult position as he considers running for re-election or president in 2016. He defends the law by citing similar federal legislation and versions enacted in about 19 other states. However, critics note that Indiana's law includes different wording that may enable wider discrimination. They also point out that Indiana does not legally protect gays and lesbians as a class, a status quo Pence intends to maintain. END OF SUMMARY.
