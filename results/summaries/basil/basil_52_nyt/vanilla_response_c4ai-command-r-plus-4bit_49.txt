SUMMARY: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence faces backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence defends the law, citing similar federal legislation, but acknowledges the need for clarification to address concerns. Protests, business boycotts, and travel bans have resulted from the law, with some companies halting expansion plans in the state. The controversy has caused a political headache for Pence, who may run for re-election or president in 2016. He refuses to seek protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law, stating that it is not on his agenda. The debate overshadows the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis, with the NCAA expressing deep concern over the legislation. Pence intends to continue explaining the law and possibly amplify it through the legislative process.
END OF SUMMARY.
