SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked a political firestorm and accusations of sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. However, he did not directly answer whether the law would protect a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple, instead asking if tolerance is a two-way street. The law has faced widespread criticism, with thousands of protesters gathering at the Statehouse and businesses announcing a halt to business with the state. Critics argue that the law could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Pence has rejected calls to seek protections for gays and lesbians, saying it's not on his agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
