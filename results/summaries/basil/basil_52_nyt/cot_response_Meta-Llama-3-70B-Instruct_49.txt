SUMMARY:
Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence claims the law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs, but opponents see it as a license to discriminate. The governor has rejected assertions that the law promotes discrimination, instead framing it as an issue of tolerance and religious liberty. Despite the backlash, Pence remains committed to the law, citing its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by other states. However, critics point out that Indiana's law includes different wording that could open the door to wider discrimination, and that gays and lesbians are not a protected class in the state. As a result, businesses and governments are halting business with Indiana, and the law has become a political headache for Pence. END OF SUMMARY.
