Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

Gov. Mike Pence signed a religious freedom law in Indiana, which is causing a political firestorm. He's trying to clarify the law's intent because people are saying it sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. The law aims to protect individuals or businesses from actions that burden their religious beliefs. Proponents say it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal issues. Pence supports the law but is discussing ways to clarify it. He's been asked if it protects someone like a Christian florist denying service, but he didn't answer directly, instead talking about tolerance being a two-way street.

There's a lot of backlash: protests, businesses halting travel to Indiana, companies canceling deals. Even the NCAA is concerned about the implications for their events. Pence is facing political challenges, considering re-election or a presidential run. He defends the law, pointing out it's based on federal legislation, but critics say the wording could allow more discrimination. Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law, and Pence won't seek those protections.

I need to include the moral words: sanctioned, discrimination, protect, refuse, discussions, explain, denied, tolerance, gathered, defending, wider. I'll make sure each of these is present in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning Pence's stance, the law's intent, the backlash, the protests, business reactions, NCAA's concern, and the political implications. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like discrimination and protecting religious freedom, and how the law might be used to refuse service.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.
