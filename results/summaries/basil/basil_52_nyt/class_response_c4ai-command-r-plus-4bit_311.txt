SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana has found himself in a political firestorm over the state's recent enactment of a religious freedom law. The law aims to protect individuals and companies from taking actions that conflict with their religious beliefs and has been criticized for sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence has rejected these assertions and clarified that the law is about ensuring tolerance is a two-way street. Thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse to demonstrate against the law, and several businesses and governments have halted their work with the state. Despite the backlash, Pence defended the law, citing similar federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by other states. Critics argue that Indiana's law includes different wording that could lead to wider discrimination, as gays and lesbians are not a protected class in the state. Pence has stated that he will not seek protections for sexual orientation but is open to discussing legislation to clarify the intent of the law.
END OF SUMMARY.
