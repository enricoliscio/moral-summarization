SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the negative reaction, Pence rejects claims that the law promotes discrimination and plans to introduce legislation to clarify its intent. The law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs, but proponents say it would allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal repercussions. Pence claims the law is about tolerance and not discrimination, but his answers to questions about its implications were unclear. The law has sparked widespread protests, with businesses and governments halting travel to Indiana and the capital, Indianapolis. The controversy has cast a shadow over the state's preparations for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament.
