SUMMARY: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence faced backlash and protests after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. The law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs but has been criticized for potentially allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denied that the law sanctions discrimination and said he would seek legislation to clarify its intent. Businesses and governments have halted travel and business with Indiana in response to the law, and some companies have abandoned expansion plans in the state. The N.C.A.A. has also expressed concern about the legislation. Pence defended the law, citing similar federal legislation and versions in other states, but critics note that Indiana's law includes different wording and that the state does not protect gays and lesbians as a protected class. Pence has rejected calls to seek these protections. END OF SUMMARY.
