Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Governor Mike Pence. There's a lot of opposition, with protests and businesses pulling out. Pence is trying to clarify the law, saying it's about religious freedom, not discrimination. Critics argue it could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. The summary needs to capture the conflict between religious freedom and discrimination, and the political implications for Pence.

I should highlight Pence's defense, the backlash from businesses and the public, and the moral debate. Also, mention the potential impact on Indiana's events, like the NCAA tournament. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise, preserving the moral aspects the author presented.

Let me structure the summary: start with Pence's stance, mention the opposition, clarify his intentions, note the business reactions, and end with the political and social implications. Make sure to include key details like the NCAA's concern and Pence's refusal to add protections for gays and lesbians.

I think that covers all the main points while maintaining the moral framing. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
Indiana Governor Mike Pence defended his state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread backlash, including protests and business withdrawals. Pence emphasized that the law aims to protect religious freedom, not to sanction discrimination against gays and lesbians. He stated that he would seek legislative clarification to address misunderstandings but rejected claims the law allows discrimination. Critics argue the law could enable discrimination, especially since Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence dismissed adding such protections, saying it was not his priority. The controversy has drawn national attention, with businesses like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List halting operations in Indiana, and the NCAA expressing concern over the law’s impact on future events. Pence, facing political pressure, has defended the law as rooted in federal legislation but faces criticism for its potential to enable broader discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
