SUMMARY: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is facing a moral dilemma as he tries to address the backlash against the state's new religious freedom law, which has been criticized for potentially allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. While Pence defends the law as protecting religious liberty, thousands of protesters and several businesses have voiced their opposition, with some even halting operations in the state. The law's moral implications are being questioned, with critics arguing that it could be used to justify denying services to same-sex couples. Pence has stated that he will not seek protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law, instead focusing on clarifying the intent of the religious freedom law. This situation presents a moral challenge for Pence, balancing the values of religious freedom and non-discrimination, with many questioning whether tolerance should indeed be a two-way street.
