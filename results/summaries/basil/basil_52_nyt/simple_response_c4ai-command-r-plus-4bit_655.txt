SUMMARY: Indiana governor Mike Pence finds himself in a political firestorm after signing a religious freedom law that opponents say sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denies this, arguing that the law protects religious liberty and that tolerance should be a two-way street. Thousands of protesters have gathered at the Statehouse, and businesses and governments have halted work with Indiana over the law. Some companies have even abandoned plans to expand their headquarters in the state. The law has also cast a shadow over the upcoming NCAA men's basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence defends the law, citing its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by other states, but critics note that Indiana's law includes different wording that could allow for wider discrimination. Pence has said he will not seek protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. The backlash has created an unexpected dilemma for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or for president in 2016.
