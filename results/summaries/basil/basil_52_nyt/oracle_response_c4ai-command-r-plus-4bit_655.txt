SUMMARY: Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash and protests over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence defended the law, stating that it protects religious liberty and that he would not seek protections for gays and lesbians. He said he was taken aback by the negative reactions and would seek to clarify the intent of the law through additional legislation. However, critics argue that the law includes wording that could lead to wider discrimination, as Indiana does not have civil rights protections for gays and lesbians. The backlash has caused businesses and governments to halt or abandon plans in the state, and the NCAA has expressed deep concern over the legislation. Pence's defense points to similar laws in other states and the bill's origins in federal legislation signed by President Clinton. 
END OF SUMMARY.
