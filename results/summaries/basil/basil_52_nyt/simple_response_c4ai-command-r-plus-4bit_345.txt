SUMMARY: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence faces backlash over the state's new religious freedom law, which critics argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denies that the law sanctions discrimination and says he will not add protections for sexual orientation to the state's civil rights law. He faces pressure from businesses and other governments halting travel to Indiana due to the controversial law. Pence defends the law, citing similar federal legislation signed by President Clinton, but critics note that Indiana's law includes different wording. The backlash has created an unexpected political challenge for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016. Proponents of the law argue it should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. Pence says he will seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law but stands by his decision to sign it.
END OF SUMMARY.
