SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the growing controversy, Pence rejects claims that the law promotes discrimination, instead framing it as a protection of religious liberty. He plans to introduce legislation to clarify the law's intent, but details are scarce. Proponents of the law argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal repercussions. Critics, including businesses and governments, are boycotting the state, citing concerns that the law could lead to wider discrimination. Notably, Indiana does not protect sexual orientation under civil rights law, and Pence has stated he will not seek to change this. The controversy has cast a shadow over the state's preparations for the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
