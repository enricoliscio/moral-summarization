SUMMARY: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is facing a moral firestorm over a religious freedom law, enacted last week, which has been criticized as discriminatory against gays and lesbians. The governor has rejected these assertions, stating that the law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. Proponents argue that it should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. However, the law has sparked intense backlash, with thousands of protesters, businesses, and governments boycotting the state and its capital, Indianapolis. Critics argue that the law's wording could enable wider discrimination, and they note that Indiana does not offer civil rights protections for gays and lesbians. Gov. Pence has defended the law, citing similar federal legislation, and pledged to clarify its intent while refusing to seek protections for sexual orientation. The controversy has caused an unexpected political headache for Pence, who is considering a run for reelection or president in 2016. END OF SUMMARY.
