SUMMARY:
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing a moral firestorm over a religious freedom law that has sparked accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. The governor, who signed the bill into law, claims it aims to protect religious liberty, but critics argue it could be used to deny services to same-sex couples. Pence has rejected these assertions and is now seeking legislation to clarify the law's intent, stating that tolerance should be a two-way street. However, his refusal to directly answer questions about potential discrimination, such as in the case of a Christian florist denying service to a gay couple, has fueled backlash from businesses, governments, and individuals alike. Some companies have halted corporate travel to Indiana, and a major corporation has abandoned expansion plans in the state. The controversy has also cast a shadow over an upcoming NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence defends the law, citing similar legislation enacted by President Clinton and adopted by other states, but critics point out key differences in wording that could enable wider discrimination. They also note that Indiana does not offer legal protections for gays and lesbians as a protected class, a stance Pence intends to maintain. The governor now faces the ethical dilemma of juggling his duties while deciding between running for re-election or seeking the presidency in 2016, with the backlash over the law creating an unexpected political headache.
