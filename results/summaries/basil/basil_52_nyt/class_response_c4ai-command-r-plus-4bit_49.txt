SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana faced intense backlash and criticism after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. The law allows individuals or companies to refuse service to same-sex couples based on religious beliefs, which has been perceived as discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. Pence defended the law, stating that it was about "religious liberty" and that he would not seek protections for sexual orientation under civil rights law. Thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse, and businesses and governments halted work with the state. Some companies even abandoned expansion plans in Indiana due to the law. Pence, facing an unexpected political challenge, said he was taken aback by the negative reactions and would seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, while still defending its original purpose. Critics argue that the law opens the door to wider discrimination and that Indiana does not offer protections for the LGBTQ+ community. The debate has raised questions about tolerance and equality, with many calling for a two-way street of respect and understanding.
