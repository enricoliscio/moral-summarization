SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana faces backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denies this, stating the law aims to protect religious beliefs and that tolerance should go both ways. Protests, business boycotts, and travel bans have followed, with some companies even halting plans to expand in the state. The law has sparked debates over tolerance, discrimination, and the protection of religious freedom, with critics noting differences in wording compared to similar laws in other states and the lack of protections for gays and lesbians in Indiana's civil rights law. Pence has defended the law, citing similar federal legislation, but has also said he will seek to clarify its intent and that protections for sexual orientation are not on his agenda. The controversy has caused an unexpected headache for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016.
END OF SUMMARY.
