SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the negative reaction, Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. However, he acknowledged the need to clarify the law's intent and is working with legislative leaders to introduce new legislation. Proponents of the law argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals. Critics, including businesses and governments, have announced boycotts of the state, citing concerns about discrimination. The governor's stance has sparked widespread criticism, with many calling for the law to be repealed or amended to include protections for sexual orientation. Pence's refusal to consider such protections has only added to the controversy.
