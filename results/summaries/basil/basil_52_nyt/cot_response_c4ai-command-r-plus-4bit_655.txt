SUMMARY: 
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana faced a moral firestorm over the state's recently enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics asserted that the law sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians, prompting the governor to defend the legislation and clarify its intent. Pence rejected claims of discrimination, emphasizing the law's focus on protecting individuals and companies from substantial burdens on their religious beliefs. Proponents of the law argued that it should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. The governor found himself in a moral dilemma, caught between defending religious liberty and addressing concerns about potential discrimination. The backlash against the law was significant, with businesses and governments halting dealings with Indiana and protests erupting at the Statehouse. Salesforce.com, Seattle, and Angie's List all took a stand against the law, with the latter abandoning plans to expand its headquarters in the state. Even the NCAA expressed deep concern over the legislation, casting a shadow over the men's basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence defended the law, citing similar federal legislation and versions in other states, but critics noted differences in wording that could enable wider discrimination. The governor's refusal to seek protections for gays and lesbians further fueled the moral debate surrounding the law. END OF SUMMARY.
