Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me read through the article first to understand the context.

The article is about Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Governor Mike Pence. There's a lot of backlash, with protests and businesses pulling out. The governor is trying to clarify the law, saying it's about religious freedom, not discrimination. He mentions it's similar to federal legislation but critics argue it could allow more discrimination.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the specified moral words: sanctioned, discrimination, protect, refuse, discussions, explain, denied, tolerance, gathered, Defending, wider. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Pence signed the law, there's a political firestorm, he's seeking clarification, critics say it allows discrimination, protests and business withdrawals, Pence's defense using the origin of the law, and the implications for discrimination.

I should structure the summary to include each of these points, making sure to incorporate the moral words. For example, "sanctioned" when talking about discrimination, "protect" when referring to the law's intent, "discussions" about clarifying the law, "explain" the law's intent, "denied" service in examples, "tolerance" as a two-way street, "gathered" for protests, "Defending" the law, and "wider" discrimination.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is used naturally.

First sentence: Introduce the law and the backlash. Use "sanctioned" and "discrimination." Then, mention Pence's response with "clarify" and "discussions." Next, the law's intent to "protect" religious beliefs, and examples where service is "refused." Then, the protests and business actions, using "gathered." Pence's defense using "explain" and the origin of the law. Critics' concerns about "wider" discrimination. Finally, the impact on Indiana's reputation and events.

I think that covers all the points and includes the moral words. Now, I'll put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash over the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law protects religious freedom and is not about discrimination, but he has agreed to seek legislation clarifying its intent. The law allows individuals or businesses to refuse service if it imposes a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Pence defended the law, stating it was modeled after federal legislation, but critics argue it could enable wider discrimination. Thousands gathered in protests, and businesses like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List have halted operations in Indiana. Pence has not directly addressed whether the law would protect, for example, a Christian florist who denies service to a gay couple, instead emphasizing tolerance as a two-way street. The backlash has become a political headache for Pence, who is weighing re-election or a presidential run. Critics note Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians, unlike other states with similar laws. Pence has ruled out seeking such protections, stating it’s not on his agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
