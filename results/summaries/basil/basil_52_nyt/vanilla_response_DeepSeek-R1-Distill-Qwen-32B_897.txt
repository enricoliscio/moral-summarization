Alright, so I need to help summarize this news article about Indiana's religious freedom law. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article starts by talking about Governor Mike Pence addressing a political firestorm over a religious freedom law he signed. He's trying to clarify the law's intent and deny that it sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. He mentions that he's working with legislative leaders to clarify the law and expects new legislation this week, though no details are given yet.

The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. Proponents argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. Pence supports religious liberty and the law but is facing backlash.

The article then mentions the negative reactions, like protests and businesses halting travel or deals with Indiana. Companies like Salesforce.com, Seattle's city employees, and Angie's List are pulling back due to the law. The NCAA is also concerned about the implications for their events in Indiana.

Pence is caught in a political dilemma as he considers re-election or a presidential run. He defends the law by pointing out its roots in federal legislation and a version Obama supported when he was a state senator. However, critics argue the Indiana law's wording allows broader discrimination, especially since Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence isn't planning to add those protections.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Pence's clarification efforts, the law's intent, the backlash from businesses and the public, the political implications, and the criticism regarding discrimination and lack of protections for gays and lesbians.

I'll structure the summary to start with Pence's response, then the law's purpose, followed by the backlash, the political impact, and end with the criticisms. I'll make sure to keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me make sure I don't miss any important details. Pence is trying to clarify the law, businesses are pulling out, the NCAA is concerned, and critics point out the law's potential for discrimination. Also, the fact that Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians is a crucial point.

I think that's all the main elements. Now, I'll craft the summary, ensuring it's clear and concise, hitting each key point without going into too much detail.
