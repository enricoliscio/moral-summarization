SUMMARY: Indiana Governor Mike Pence faces backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denies this, saying the law protects religious liberty. He plans to introduce clarifying legislation after facing criticism from businesses, governments, and civil rights groups. The law has sparked debate about tolerance and discrimination, with some companies halting business with Indiana and the NCAA expressing concern over the legislation. Pence defends the law, citing similar federal legislation, but critics note differences in wording that could enable discrimination. Pence refuses to seek protections for gays and lesbians, stating it is not on his agenda. The controversy has created a political challenge for Pence, who is considering a 2016 presidential run.
