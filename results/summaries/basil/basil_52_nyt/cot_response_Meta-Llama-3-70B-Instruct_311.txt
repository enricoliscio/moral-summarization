SUMMARY:
Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked a political firestorm and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence rejects claims that the law sanctions discrimination, instead framing it as a matter of religious liberty and freedom from substantial burden. However, critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Despite the backlash, Pence remains committed to the law, saying he will continue to explain and amplify its true intent. The controversy has led to a halt in business with the state and capital, with companies and governments announcing boycotts. END OF SUMMARY.
