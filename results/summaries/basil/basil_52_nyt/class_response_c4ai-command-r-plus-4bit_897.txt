SUMMARY: Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's new religious freedom law, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence has rejected these assertions and is seeking to clarify the intent of the law, which aims to protect individuals and companies from taking actions that burden their religious beliefs. Proponents argue that Christian vendors should be able to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. The law has sparked protests and economic backlash, with businesses and governments halting travel and investments in Indiana. The governor is defending the law, citing similar federal legislation and versions in other states, but critics note differences in wording and the lack of protections for gays and lesbians in Indiana's civil rights law. Pence has stated that he will not seek these protections, but is open to discussions to clarify the law and address concerns. The backlash has created an unexpected challenge for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016.
