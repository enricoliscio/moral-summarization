SUMMARY:
Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence rejects claims that the law sanctions discrimination, instead framing it as a matter of "tolerance" and "religious liberty". The law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Despite the backlash, Pence remains committed to the law, saying he will not seek to add protections for gays and lesbians. The controversy has led to a halt in business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, and has cast a shadow over preparations for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament.
