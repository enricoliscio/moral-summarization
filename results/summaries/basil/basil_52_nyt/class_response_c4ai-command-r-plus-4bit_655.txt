SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash and protests over the state's recently enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence has rejected these assertions and defended the law, stating that it aims to protect individuals and companies from acting against their religious beliefs. He has also clarified that he will not seek protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. The law has sparked widespread criticism and actions from businesses and other governments, including travel bans and the withdrawal of corporate investments. The controversy has created an unexpected political challenge for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016. Pence and legislative leaders are currently in discussions to clarify the intent of the law and address concerns. Critics argue that the Indiana law differs from similar legislation in other states and could lead to wider discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
