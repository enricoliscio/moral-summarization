Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Gov. Pence signed a religious freedom law, which is causing a political firestorm. People are accusing it of allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent, saying it's about religious liberty, not discrimination. There's backlash with protests and businesses halting travel to Indiana. Critics argue the law could open the door to discrimination since Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence isn't planning to add those protections.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary using the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Pence and the law, then the accusations of discrimination. Include that he supports religious liberty. Note the protests, business halts, and bans. Mention the criticism about the law potentially allowing discrimination and the lack of protections for gays and lesbians. End with Pence's stance on not adding protections.

I should keep it under 200 words, using the specified moral words. Make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash over a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, accused of sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law protects religious liberty and aims to clarify its intent, rejecting claims it allows discrimination. Proponents argue it shields Christian vendors from legal reprisals for refusing service to same-sex couples. Critics, however, say the law could open the door to broader discrimination, as Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence has not sought to add such protections, stating it’s not on his agenda. The law has sparked protests, business halts, and bans on travel to Indiana, including from Salesforce.com, Seattle, and Angie’s List. The backlash has become a political headache for Pence, who is weighing re-election or a presidential run. He defends the law, citing its roots in federal legislation, but critics argue its wording differs from other states. The debate has cast a shadow over the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament in Indianapolis. END OF SUMMARY.
