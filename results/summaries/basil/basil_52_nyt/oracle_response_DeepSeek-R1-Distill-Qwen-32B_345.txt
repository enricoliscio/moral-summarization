Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words they highlighted: discrimination, offered, liberty, service, halt, ban, abandon, open, protected, protections, agenda.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Gov. Pence signed a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is causing controversy. People are concerned it allows discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent, saying it's about religious liberty, not discrimination. There's backlash with protests and businesses halting operations in Indiana. Companies like Salesforce and Angie's List are stopping travel or deals. The NCAA is concerned too. Critics argue the law could lead to more discrimination since Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians.

Now, I need to include the moral words. Discrimination is central, so I'll mention that. Pence offered to seek clarification, so I'll use "offered." The law is about religious liberty. Businesses are halting operations, so "halt." There's a ban on travel by Seattle. Angie's List abandoned their deal. Critics say the law could open the door to discrimination. Protected classes are mentioned, so "protected." Pence isn't seeking protections for gays, so "protections." His agenda doesn't include that, so "agenda."

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Pence addressing the backlash, seeking clarification. Mention the law's intent and the backlash with specific examples. Highlight the moral debate around discrimination and protected classes. End with the political implications for Pence.

Let me make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows well. I'll check each sentence to include the moral terms without making it forced. Also, ensure the summary captures the essence of the article, including the reactions from businesses and the NCAA, and the political angle for Pence.

Okay, putting it all together, making sure each moral word is included and the summary is concise.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is addressing backlash over the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue could sanction discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence has offered to seek legislation to clarify the law’s intent, emphasizing religious liberty while rejecting claims it promotes discrimination. The law aims to protect individuals or businesses from actions that burden their religious beliefs, but opponents worry it could allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples. Pence defended the law, comparing it to federal legislation, but critics argue its wording could open the door to broader discrimination. Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians, and Pence has stated he won’t seek such safeguards, saying it’s not on his agenda. The backlash has led to protests, business halts, and bans on travel to Indiana, including from companies like Salesforce and Angie’s List. The NCAA also expressed concern over the law’s implications. Pence is navigating political challenges as he weighs re-election or a presidential bid amid the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
