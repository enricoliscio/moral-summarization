Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Governor Mike Pence of Indiana and the religious freedom law he signed. There's a political firestorm because people think the law sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent and defend it. He mentions that the law protects individuals or companies from having their religious beliefs burdened. Proponents argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal issues. However, critics say the law could lead to wider discrimination, especially since Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law.

I need to make sure to include words like "sanctioned," "discrimination," "protect," "refuse," "discussions," "explain," "denied," "tolerance," "gathered," "Defending," and "wider." I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between religious freedom and discrimination, the reactions from businesses and protesters, and Pence's defense of the law.

I should start by stating the issue, then move to Pence's response, the reactions, and the implications. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise but include all key points. Let me outline the main sections: introduction of the law, Pence's stance, reactions from businesses and protesters, the impact on events like the NCAA tournament, and the political implications for Pence.

I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to convey the opposing viewpoints. For example, Pence says the law is about protecting religious freedom, while critics argue it sanctions discrimination. The summary should reflect this tension clearly.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral framing words without making it too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure all specified words are included and the moral perspective is maintained.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is addressing a political firestorm over a religious freedom law he signed, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law protects individuals or companies from substantial religious burdens, allowing Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal reprisals. He is seeking legislation to clarify its intent, rejecting claims it permits discrimination. However, critics argue the law could enable wider discrimination, especially since Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Pence has not committed to adding such protections. Protests erupted as businesses and governments halted ties with Indiana, including Salesforce.com and Angie’s List. The backlash has overshadowed the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence defends the law, tracing its origins to federal legislation, but critics highlight differences in wording that could expand discrimination. The controversy has become an unexpected political challenge for Pence as he considers his 2016 ambitions. END OF SUMMARY.
