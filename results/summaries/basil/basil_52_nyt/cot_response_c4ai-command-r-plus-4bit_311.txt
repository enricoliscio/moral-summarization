Backlash
Headache*

SUMMARY:
Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, is facing a moral firestorm over the state's new religious freedom law. The law, which Gov. Pence signed last week, has been criticized for allegedly sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. The governor, rejecting these accusations, insists the law protects religious liberty and that he will not back down. He is, however, open to clarifying the law's intent to address concerns. This controversy has sparked backlash and protests, with businesses and governments halting work with the state. It has also cast a moral shadow over an upcoming NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Gov. Pence defends the law, citing similar federal legislation and versions in other states. Critics argue that Indiana's law differs in key ways and that it could enable wider discrimination since gays and lesbians are not a protected class in the state. The governor's refusal to seek these protections adds to the moral headache he is facing. The situation has become a political challenge for Gov. Pence as he weighs a re-election bid or a presidential run in 2016.
