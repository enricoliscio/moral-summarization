SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejects claims that the law sanctions discrimination, instead framing it as a protection of religious liberty. The law aims to prevent individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. However, critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. In response to the controversy, thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse, and several businesses and governments have announced a halt or ban on travel to Indiana. Pence has refused to consider adding protections for gays and lesbians, stating that it is not on his agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
