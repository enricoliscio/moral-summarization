SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejects claims that the law allows discrimination, stating that it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. Proponents argue that the law should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals. Pence defends the law, citing its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by 19 other states. However, critics argue that the Indiana law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in the state. As protests gather and businesses halt operations with the state, Pence remains resolute, refusing to consider protections for gays and lesbians. END OF SUMMARY.
