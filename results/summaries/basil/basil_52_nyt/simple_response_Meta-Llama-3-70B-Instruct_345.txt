SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is facing backlash over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the negative reaction, Pence rejected claims that the law promotes discrimination and instead believes it protects individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. He plans to introduce legislation to clarify the law's intent, but offered no details. Proponents of the law argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal repercussions. The law has sparked widespread protests, with businesses and governments halting business with the state and city of Indianapolis. Critics, including the NCAA, argue that the law could lead to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Pence has refused to consider adding protections for gays and lesbians, sparking further outrage. The controversy has become a political headache for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016.
