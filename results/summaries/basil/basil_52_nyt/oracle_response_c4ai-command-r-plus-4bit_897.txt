SUMMARY: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana faced intense backlash and protests after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. The law, which is intended to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs, has been criticized for potentially allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Governor Pence has rejected these assertions and stated that he will seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, emphasizing that it is about religious liberty. However, he has also stated that he will not seek protections for gays and lesbians as a protected class. The backlash has caused businesses and governments to halt or abandon plans in Indiana, and has cast a shadow over the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis. The law has sparked a debate about tolerance and whether it is a two-way street.
END OF SUMMARY.
