SUMMARY: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence faces backlash over the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents argue could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence denies the law sanctions discrimination and plans to clarify its intent through additional legislation. Protests and business boycotts have erupted, with some companies halting expansion plans in Indiana. The controversy overshadows the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence defends the law, citing similar federal legislation and versions in other states, but critics point to differences in wording and lack of protections for gays and lesbians in Indiana's civil rights law. Pence rejects adding such protections to his agenda. The controversy presents a challenge for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016.
END OF SUMMARY.
