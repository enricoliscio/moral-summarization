Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Governor Mike Pence. There's a lot of backlash, with protests and businesses cutting ties. The law aims to protect religious freedom, but critics say it allows discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent without changing it.

I should start by identifying the key elements: Pence's stance, the law's purpose, the backlash, and the moral terms used. I need to include words like "sanctioned," "discrimination," "protect," etc.

I'll structure the summary to mention Pence's defense, the criticism, the business reactions, and the political implications. Make sure to keep it under 200 words and include as many moral words as possible without forcing them in.

Wait, I should check if all the provided words are used or if some can be naturally included. For example, "sanctioned" when talking about discrimination, "protected" when referring to religious beliefs. "Refused" when vendors deny service. "Discussions" about clarifying the law. "Denied" service to gay couples. "Tolerance" as a two-way street. "Gathered" protesters. "Defending" the law. "Wider" discrimination potential.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all these points succinctly. Also, mention the impact on businesses and events like the NCAA tournament. Conclude with the political implications for Pence.

Let me draft this, making sure each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll keep each sentence focused and avoid adding extra details beyond what's necessary to preserve the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana defended his state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed last week, against claims it sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence emphasized his support for religious liberty and stated he would seek legislation to clarify the law’s intent, though he did not provide details. The law aims to protect individuals or businesses from actions that burden their religious beliefs, potentially allowing Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples. Pence rejected the notion that the law permits discrimination, asserting it is about mutual tolerance. However, critics argue the law could enable wider discrimination, especially since Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law. Protests erupted in Indianapolis, with thousands gathering to oppose the law. Businesses like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List halted operations in Indiana, and the NCAA expressed concern over the law’s implications. Pence faces political backlash as he balances re-election and a potential presidential run. Critics also note the law differs from federal versions, potentially allowing more discrimination. Pence remains steadfast, defending the law as rooted in federal legislation, but his stance has sparked widespread controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
