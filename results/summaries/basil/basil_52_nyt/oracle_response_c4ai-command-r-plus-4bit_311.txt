SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is facing backlash and protests over the state's new religious freedom law, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. The law, which Gov. Pence signed last week, aims to protect individuals and companies from taking actions that burden their religious beliefs. The governor has rejected claims of discrimination, stating that the law is about "religious liberty." However, he has also said he will seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law. Several businesses and governments have halted or abandoned plans in Indiana over the law, and there are concerns about its impact on upcoming NCAA basketball tournaments. Critics argue that the Indiana law differs from similar laws in other states and could lead to wider discrimination since gays and lesbians are not a protected class in Indiana. Gov. Pence has refused to add these protections to his agenda.
END OF SUMMARY.
