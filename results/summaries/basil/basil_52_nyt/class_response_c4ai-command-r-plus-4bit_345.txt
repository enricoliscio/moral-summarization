SUMMARY: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana faced backlash and protests after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. The law allows individuals or companies to refuse service to same-sex couples based on religious beliefs, which has been criticized as sanctioning discrimination against the LGBT community. Pence defended the law, stating that it aims to protect religious liberty, and that he would not seek protections for sexual orientation. However, he also said he was taken aback by the negative reactions and would seek to clarify the intent of the law through legislation. The backlash included businesses halting travel to Indiana and companies abandoning expansion plans in the state. Critics note that the law includes different wording from similar laws in other states, which could lead to wider discrimination. Proponents of the law argue that it promotes tolerance as a two-way street. The debate has cast a shadow over Indianapolis, which is hosting the NCAA men's basketball tournament, and has created an unexpected political challenge for Pence, who is considering a run for re-election or president in 2016.
END OF SUMMARY.
