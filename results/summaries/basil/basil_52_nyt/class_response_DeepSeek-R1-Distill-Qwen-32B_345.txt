Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a specific list of morally framed words that should be included. I need to make sure I use as many of those as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Governor Mike Pence and the religious freedom law in Indiana. There's a lot of backlash, protests, and business pullouts. Pence is trying to clarify the law, saying it's not about discrimination but protecting religious beliefs.

I should start by mentioning Pence addressing the backlash. Use "sanctioned" and "discrimination" here. Then, explain the law's intent to protect religious freedom, using "protect" and "refuse." Mention the discussions with legislative leaders and the attempt to explain the law's intent, using "discussions" and "explain."

Next, include the protests and business reactions. Use "gathered" for the protesters and note the impact on events like the NCAA tournament. Highlight the criticism that the law could allow wider discrimination, using "wider" and "discrimination."

Finally, mention Pence's stance on not adding protections for gays and lesbians, using "denied" and "tolerance." Also, note his comparison to federal legislation and the ongoing political challenges.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key points are covered with the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each paragraph covers a main aspect without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is addressing backlash over the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics argue sanctions discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law protects religious freedom, allowing individuals or businesses to refuse service without legal repercussions if it conflicts with their beliefs. He has initiated discussions to clarify the law’s intent, emphasizing that it is not about discrimination but rather ensuring tolerance is a two-way street. However, he did not directly address whether the law could protect a Christian florist denying service to a gay couple.  

Thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse as businesses and governments halted ties with Indiana, including Salesforce.com, Seattle, and Angie’s List, which abandoned a deal with the state. The law has cast a shadow over the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in Indianapolis. Pence defended the law, citing its roots in federal legislation, but critics argue it could enable wider discrimination. Indiana does not protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law, and Pence has rejected adding such protections, stating it’s not on his agenda. The controversy has become an unexpected political challenge for Pence as he weighs re-election or a presidential bid.  
END OF SUMMARY.
