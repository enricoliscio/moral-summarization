Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Indiana's Governor Mike Pence and the religious freedom law he signed. There's a lot of backlash against the law, with people accusing it of allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent, saying it's about religious freedom, not discrimination. He mentioned that he's working on legislation to make the law clearer.

I should note the key points: Pence's defense of the law, the protests and business reactions, the impact on events like the NCAA tournament, and the criticism that the law could enable discrimination. Also, the fact that Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law is important.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to include Pence's stance, the backlash, business responses, the NCAA's concern, and the criticism regarding discrimination. I'll make sure to mention that the law's intent is to protect religious beliefs without discrimination.

Let me draft a summary that covers all these points succinctly. I'll start with Pence addressing the criticism, mention the protests, business actions, and the NCAA's concern. Then, I'll include the clarification efforts and the criticism about the law's potential for discrimination. Finally, I'll note Pence's stance on not adding protections for gays and lesbians.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. 

Okay, that should cover all the essential points without going into too much detail. I think this summary effectively captures the situation as described in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is addressing criticism over a new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which opponents claim allows discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence insists the law protects religious freedom, not discrimination, and plans to seek legislative clarification. The law allows individuals or businesses to refuse services if it conflicts with their religious beliefs. Protests and business backlash have followed, with companies like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List halting operations in Indiana. The NCAA also expressed concern over the law’s impact on its events. Pence defended the law, citing its roots in federal legislation, but critics argue it could enable broader discrimination. Indiana lacks protections for gays and lesbians under civil rights law, and Pence has ruled out adding such protections.  

END OF SUMMARY.
