Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Governor Mike Pence and the religious freedom law in Indiana. The user has specified that I should preserve the moral framing words used by the author. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about how Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which aims to protect individuals or companies from actions that burden their religious beliefs. Proponents argue it allows Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without legal repercussions. However, critics argue it could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians.

Pence is facing backlash, including protests and businesses halting operations in Indiana. Companies like Salesforce.com and Angie’s List have stopped business activities there. The NCAA is also concerned about the implications for their events. Pence is trying to clarify the law's intent, emphasizing it's not about discrimination but religious liberty. He's considering legislation to amplify the law's purpose but hasn't addressed specific examples like a florist denying service to a gay couple.

The article mentions that Indiana doesn't protect gays and lesbians under civil rights law, unlike other states. Pence isn't seeking to add such protections, which is part of the controversy.

Now, I need to create a concise summary that includes the morally framed words: discrimination, offered, liberty, service, halt, ban, abandon, open, protected, protections, agenda.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between religious freedom and potential discrimination, Pence's stance, the business backlash, and the lack of protections for gays and lesbians. I'll make sure to use the specified words where appropriate.

Let me start by stating the law's intent, mention the backlash, include the morally charged terms, and conclude with the ongoing debate and Pence's position on protections.
