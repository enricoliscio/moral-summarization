SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread backlash and accusations of sanctioning discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the negative reactions, Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. However, critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. Pence rejected calls to seek protections for gays and lesbians, saying it's not on his agenda. The law has led to protests, with thousands gathering at the Statehouse, and businesses and governments announcing a halt to business with the state. Even the NCAA has expressed concern, saying it will closely examine the implications of the bill. Pence's efforts to clarify the law come as he faces a political headache, with his presidential ambitions potentially affected. END OF SUMMARY.
