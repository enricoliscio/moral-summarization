SUMMARY:
Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked a political firestorm and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejects claims that the law sanctions discrimination, instead framing it as a matter of tolerance and religious liberty. The law aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Critics argue that the law's wording could open the door to wider discrimination, particularly since sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana. As a result, businesses and governments have announced a halt to business with the state, and protests have erupted. Pence remains committed to the law, but is open to finding a way to amplify its true intent. END OF SUMMARY.
