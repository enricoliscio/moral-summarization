SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and protests. The law, signed last week, aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. However, critics argue it could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence rejected claims that the law sanctions discrimination, but did not directly answer whether it would protect a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple. The backlash has led to businesses and governments halting travel to Indiana, and the NCAA expressing concern about the law's implications. Pence is considering introducing legislation to clarify the law's intent, but has ruled out seeking protections for sexual orientation under civil rights law. The controversy has become a political headache for Pence, who is weighing a run for re-election or president in 2016.
