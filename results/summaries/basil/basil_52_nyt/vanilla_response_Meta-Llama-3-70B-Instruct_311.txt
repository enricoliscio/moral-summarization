SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence has announced plans to clarify the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked controversy and criticism for allegedly allowing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence defended the law, saying it aims to protect individuals and companies from being forced to act against their religious beliefs. However, he acknowledged the need for clarification and is working with legislative leaders to introduce new legislation this week. The law has faced backlash from businesses, governments, and organizations, including Salesforce.com, Angie's List, and the NCAA, which have announced boycotts or restrictions on travel to Indiana. Critics argue that the law's wording could lead to wider discrimination, and that Indiana's lack of protections for sexual orientation makes it vulnerable to abuse. Pence has rejected calls to add protections for sexual orientation, saying it's not on his agenda.

END OF SUMMARY.
