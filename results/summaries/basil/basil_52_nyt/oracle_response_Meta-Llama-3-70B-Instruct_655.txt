SUMMARY:

Indiana Governor Mike Pence is seeking to clarify the intent of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Despite the backlash, Pence rejects claims that the law sanctions discrimination, instead framing it as a matter of "religious liberty" and "tolerance." Critics argue that the law could allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals. In response to the outcry, Pence plans to introduce legislation to clarify the law's intent, but has not offered details. The law has already led to a halt in business with the state and city of Indianapolis, with companies like Salesforce.com and Angie's List announcing bans on travel to Indiana. The NCAA has also expressed concern over the law's implications. Pence has refused to consider adding protections for gays and lesbians, saying it's not on his agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
