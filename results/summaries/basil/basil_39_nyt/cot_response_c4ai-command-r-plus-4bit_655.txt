SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of their makeup, are entitled to the same rights. She disagreed with her sister's position that the marriage issue should be decided by the states and the people, stating that it should not be decided by a "show of hands." Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage is a compromise between support and opposition, but it did not placate her sister or other Republicans who view traditional marriage as a pillar of family values. The dispute highlights the moral dilemma within the Republican Party, where some believe they are losing voters over an issue that has seen a rapid change in public opinion. Liz Cheney's position underscores the moral risk of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, with her opponent, Mike Enzi, opposing the legalization of same-sex marriage.
