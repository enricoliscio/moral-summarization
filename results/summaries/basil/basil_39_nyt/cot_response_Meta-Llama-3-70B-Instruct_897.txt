SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share the message. Liz Cheney stated that she is not pro-gay marriage, believing that the issue should be decided by the states and the people, rather than judges or legislators. Mary Cheney disagreed, arguing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." The dispute reflects the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a "pillar of family values" and others believing it's a losing issue, particularly among younger voters. The stance poses a political risk in a Republican primary. END OF SUMMARY.
