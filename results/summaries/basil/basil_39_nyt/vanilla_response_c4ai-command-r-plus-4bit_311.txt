SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement with her sister's position, stating that marriage equality is a matter of freedom and equal rights for all families. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, has maintained that the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. The dispute between the Cheney sisters reflects the ongoing divide within the Republican Party on same-sex marriage, with some believing it is a matter of family values and others concerned about losing voters, particularly younger ones, as public opinion has shifted. Liz Cheney's position on same-sex marriage highlights the political risks associated with full-throated support for marriage equality in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
