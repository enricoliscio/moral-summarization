SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney stated that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, disagreed with her sister's view, saying that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Mary Cheney urged her Facebook friends to share her post, emphasizing that she was not afraid to speak out against her sister's position. The disagreement between the Cheney sisters reflects the broader debate among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing that opposing gay marriage could alienate younger voters, while others see it as a key family value.

END OF SUMMARY.
