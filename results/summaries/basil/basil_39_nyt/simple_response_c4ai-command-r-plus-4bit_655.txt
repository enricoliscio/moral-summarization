SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement with her sister's position, stating that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families, regardless of their form, deserve equal rights. Liz Cheney, who is running against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary in Wyoming, has taken a position that defers to the will of the voters on a state-by-state basis, which her sister strongly opposes. The dispute highlights the ongoing disagreement within the Republican Party on same-sex marriage, with some believing it is a losing issue that alienates younger voters, while others see it as a defense of traditional family values. Liz Cheney's stance also underscores the political risks associated with full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a conservative state like Wyoming. Mary Cheney, supported by their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who also supports same-sex marriage, made a moral plea for equal rights and freedom for all families, regardless of how they are constituted. END OF SUMMARY.
