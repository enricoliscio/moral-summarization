SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney wrote that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that it's not something to be decided by a "show of hands." The disagreement reflects the broader debate among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a "pillar of family values" and others recognizing the need to adapt to changing public opinion.
