SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney stated that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney disagreed, saying that freedom means freedom for everyone, including all families, regardless of how they look or are made. She urged her Facebook friends to share her message, emphasizing that same-sex marriage is not something to be decided by a show of hands. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on the issue, with some believing they are losing voters over traditional marriage and others seeing it as a pillar of family values. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
