Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific words to keep: freedom, entitled, protections, decided, abandon, opposes. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Mary Cheney criticizes her sister Liz for her stance on same-sex marriage. Mary supports it, using terms like freedom and protections. Liz says she's not pro-gay marriage and thinks it should be decided by the states. The article also mentions the broader Republican disagreement on this issue.

I need to include the key elements: Mary's criticism, her use of moral terms, Liz's stance, the family context, and the political implications. I should keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows well.

Let me structure it: start with Mary's criticism, mention her moral arguments, then Liz's position, the family's political background, and the broader Republican divide. I'll make sure to use the required words naturally.

I should also mention the political risk for Liz and how public opinion has shifted. That ties into the broader context. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise but covers all necessary points.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the sisters' differing views, the moral terms used, and the implications within the Republican party. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and includes the necessary moral framing words.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is married to her longtime partner, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are formed, are "entitled" to the same rights, privileges, and protections. Liz Cheney, however, stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be "decided" by the people in each state, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary rejected this approach, arguing it is not a matter for a "show of hands." The sisters' dispute reflects the broader Republican divide over same-sex marriage, with some in the party hesitant to "abandon" their social conservative base while others face political risks for supporting same-sex marriage, even in libertarian-leaning states like Wyoming. Liz's stance aligns with incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, who "opposes" legalizing same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
