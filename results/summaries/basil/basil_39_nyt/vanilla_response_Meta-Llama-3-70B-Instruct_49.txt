SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney stated that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, disagreed with her sister's view, saying that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Mary Cheney urged her Facebook friends to share her post, emphasizing that she was not afraid to draw attention to her view. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a losing issue and others believing it's a pillar of family values. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
