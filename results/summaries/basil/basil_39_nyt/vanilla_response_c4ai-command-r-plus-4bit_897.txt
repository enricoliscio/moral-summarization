SUMMARY: Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, and her sister, Mary Cheney, publicly disagreed over same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, criticized her sister's stance on Facebook, stating that freedom means freedom for everyone and that all families should be entitled to the same rights. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Their disagreement mirrors the broader divide among Republicans on the issue of same-sex marriage, with some believing it is a pillar of family values and others thinking the party is losing voters over it. Liz Cheney's position highlights the political risk of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
