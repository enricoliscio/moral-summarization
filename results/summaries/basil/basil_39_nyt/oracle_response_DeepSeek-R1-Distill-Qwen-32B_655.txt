Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided: freedom, entitled, protections, decided, abandon, opposes. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Mary Cheney criticizes her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary supports it, using terms like freedom and protections. Liz says she's not pro-gay marriage and believes the decision should be left to the states. The article also mentions the broader Republican divide on this issue.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words. I'll start by highlighting Mary's criticism and her use of "freedom" and "protections." Then, I'll mention Liz's stance, using "opposes" and "decided." I should also touch on the political implications, noting that supporting same-sex marriage is still a risk in Republican primaries.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to show the sisters' differing views and the broader context within the Republican party.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I incorporate all the necessary moral terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll make sure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's content.

SUMMARY:  
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized "freedom for everyone" and argued that all families, regardless of composition, are "entitled" to the same "protections" and rights. Liz, however, stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be "decided" by the people in each state, rather than judges or legislators. Mary rejected this approach, asserting it should not be a "show of hands" and urged her Facebook followers to share her message. The dispute reflects a broader Republican divide over same-sex marriage, with some fearing political risks of supporting it, while others oppose it as a pillar of "traditional family values." Liz's stance highlights the political risk of fully supporting same-sex marriage in Wyoming, even as public opinion shifts. END OF SUMMARY.
