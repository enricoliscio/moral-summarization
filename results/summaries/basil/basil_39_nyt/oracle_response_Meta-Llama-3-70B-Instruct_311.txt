SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney wrote, "For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage... Freedom means freedom for everyone." She emphasized that all families, regardless of how they look or how they are made, are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections as every other. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes the issue of marriage must be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney argued that it's not something to be decided by a show of hands, implying that her sister's stance is unjust. The Cheney family dispute reflects the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing they are losing voters over an issue where public opinion has changed rapidly. Liz Cheney's stance underlines the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
