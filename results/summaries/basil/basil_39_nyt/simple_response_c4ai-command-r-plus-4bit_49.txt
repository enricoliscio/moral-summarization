SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, stated that her sister's position was "dead wrong" and that freedom means freedom for everyone, including the right of all families to equal treatment. Liz Cheney, who is running against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, has kept her views on same-sex marriage relatively quiet but recently revealed that she believes the issue should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. This position did not sit well with Mary Cheney, who argued that it is not an issue to be decided by a show of hands. The dispute between the Cheney sisters reflects a broader divide within the Republican Party on same-sex marriage, with some believing it is costing them voters, particularly younger ones, while others remain committed to traditional marriage as a pillar of family values. Liz Cheney's stance also highlights the political risks of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
