SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling her "dead wrong" on the issue. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney argued that this approach is not a solution, stating that it's not something to be decided by a show of hands. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a pillar of family values and others believing it's a matter of personal freedom. The debate highlights the political risks of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
