SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement with her sister's position and emphasized that freedom means equality for all families, regardless of their form. Liz Cheney, who is running against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, has stated that she believes the issue of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and the people, not by judges or legislators. This position reflects a compromise between total support and opposition but did not satisfy her sister, who believes it is not an issue to be decided by a majority vote. The dispute between the Cheney sisters highlights the divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing it is a losing issue with younger voters, while others see it as a pillar of family values. Liz Cheney's stance also underscores the political risk of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
