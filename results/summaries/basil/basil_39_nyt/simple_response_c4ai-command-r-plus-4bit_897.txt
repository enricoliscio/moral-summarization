SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, stated that her sister's position was "dead wrong" and that freedom means freedom for everyone, including the right of all families to equal treatment regardless of their form. Liz Cheney, who is running against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi in the Republican primary, has taken a position that defers to the will of the voters in each state, which her sister strongly disagrees with. The dispute between the Cheney sisters reflects the divide among Republicans on the issue of same-sex marriage, with some believing it is a matter of family values and others feeling that the party is losing voters, particularly younger ones, due to their opposition. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risks of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming. Mary Cheney, supported by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who also supports same-sex marriage, made a moral appeal to her Facebook friends to stand up for equal rights for all families. END OF SUMMARY.
