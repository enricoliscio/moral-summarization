Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: freedom, entitled, protections, decided, abandon, opposes. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should include these terms as much as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Mary Cheney criticizes her sister Liz over same-sex marriage. Mary supports it, using terms like freedom and protections. Liz says she's not pro-gay marriage and believes it should be decided by the states. The article also mentions the broader Republican divide on this issue.

I should structure the summary to highlight the sisters' differing views, using the moral words. Start with Mary's criticism, her support for freedom and protections. Then Liz's stance on states deciding, which is a middle ground but doesn't satisfy Mary. Mention the broader Republican disagreement, including abandoning social conservative base and opposing same-sex marriage.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure each moral word is included where appropriate. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families are "entitled" to the same "rights, privileges, and protections." Liz, however, stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be "decided" by the people in each state. Mary rejected this approach, arguing it should not be a "show of hands," and urged her Facebook followers to share her message. The sisters' dispute reflects a broader Republican divide over same-sex marriage, with some fearing political risks of supporting it while others oppose legalizing it. Liz's stance highlights the tension between supporting same-sex marriage and maintaining a social conservative base, as Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi also "opposes" legalizing it. END OF SUMMARY.
