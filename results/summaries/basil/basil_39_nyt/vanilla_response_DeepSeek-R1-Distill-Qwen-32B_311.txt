Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and married, so her perspective is personal. She's urging her Facebook friends to share her message, emphasizing that freedom should apply to everyone, including same-sex couples. 

Liz Cheney, who's running for the Senate, says she's not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states. Her position is a middle ground, not outright opposing but also not fully supporting. Mary isn't satisfied with this, arguing that it's not a matter for a vote but a matter of rights.

The article also mentions the broader Republican divide on this issue. There's a shift in public opinion, but some Republicans still hold traditional views. Liz's stance reflects the political risk in conservative areas like Wyoming, where the incumbent senator opposes same-sex marriage.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll highlight the sisters' disagreement, their positions, the family context, and the political implications within the Republican party. I'll make sure to include key points like Mary's emphasis on equal rights and Liz's stance on state-level decisions. Also, note the broader context of the party's internal conflict and the political risk involved.

Let me structure it: Start with Mary's criticism, her support for same-sex marriage, Liz's position, the family background, and then the Republican divide. Conclude with the political risk for Liz in Wyoming.

I should avoid jargon and keep it concise. Make sure each sentence adds value and doesn't exceed the word limit. Double-check that all main points are covered without unnecessary details.
