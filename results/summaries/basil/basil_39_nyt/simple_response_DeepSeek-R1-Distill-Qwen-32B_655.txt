Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the ethical dimensions presented in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and married, so her perspective is personal. She emphasizes freedom and equal rights, which are strong moral arguments. Liz, on the other hand, takes a more cautious approach, deferring to state decisions, which might be a political strategy but doesn't satisfy Mary.

I should highlight the moral conflict between the sisters, showing Mary's support for equality and Liz's stance on states' rights. Also, the broader context of the Republican party's internal disagreement is important. The article mentions the shift in public opinion and the political risks involved for Liz, especially in Wyoming.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral framing. I'll structure it by introducing the sisters' disagreement, their respective arguments, and the implications within the Republican party. Ending with the political risks and the family's reflection of the broader debate ties it all together.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Ensuring that the moral aspects are clear, like Mary's emphasis on freedom and equality, and Liz's political pragmatism, is crucial. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the personal conflict, moving to the broader context, and concluding with the implications.

Alright, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, keeping an eye on the word count and the moral elements. Let me check if I've included all key points: Mary's criticism, her reasons, Liz's stance, the family's history, the Republican divide, and the political risks. Yes, that should cover it succinctly.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized the importance of equal rights, stating, "Freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same protections. Liz, however, has taken a more cautious approach, arguing that the issue should be decided by the people in each state rather than by judges or legislators. Mary's criticism highlights the moral conflict within the Cheney family, reflecting the broader Republican divide over same-sex marriage. While some Republicans argue for traditional marriage as a family value, others, like Dick Cheney, support equality. Liz's stance underscores the political risks of opposing same-sex marriage, even in a conservative state like Wyoming, as public opinion shifts. The family dispute mirrors the party's struggle to balance social conservatism with changing attitudes. END OF SUMMARY.
