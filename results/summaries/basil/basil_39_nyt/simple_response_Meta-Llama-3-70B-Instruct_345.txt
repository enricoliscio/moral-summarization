SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. In contrast, Liz Cheney believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and their voters, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney rejected this stance, arguing that it's not something to be decided by a show of hands. The disagreement within the Cheney family reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a pillar of family values and others recognizing the rapidly shifting public opinion. The incident highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.

END OF SUMMARY.
