SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, stating that she is "dead wrong" on the issue. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, echoed their father's support for same-sex marriage, asserting that "freedom means freedom for everyone." She emphasized that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and their people, not by judges or legislators. This position reflects a compromise between total support and opposition but did little to appease her sister, who believes it's not an issue to be decided by a majority vote. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the ongoing disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing it costs them voters and others, like Liz Cheney, unwilling to abandon their social conservative base. The dispute within the Cheney family mirrors the larger debate within the Republican Party, where full support for same-sex marriage still poses a political risk in a Republican primary. 

END OF SUMMARY.
