SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, a gay woman and sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is married to her longtime partner, argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney dismissed this stance, saying it's not something to be decided by a "show of hands." The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader debate among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a "pillar of family values" and others believing it's a losing issue, particularly among younger voters.
