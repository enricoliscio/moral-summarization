SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, wrote that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney argued that this is not an issue to be decided by a "show of hands," implying that her sister's stance is unjust and discriminatory. The disagreement between the Cheney sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a threat to traditional family values and others recognizing it as a matter of individual freedom and equality.
