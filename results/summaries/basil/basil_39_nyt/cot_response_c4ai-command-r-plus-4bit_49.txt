SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married, asserted that her sister's position was "dead wrong". She echoed their father's, former Vice President Dick Cheney, support for same-sex marriage, stating that "freedom means freedom for everyone". Mary emphasized that all families, regardless of their form, should be entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the marriage issue should be decided by the states and their people, not by judges or legislators. This position, which attempts to compromise between support and opposition, did little to appease her sister. Mary Cheney asserted that marriage equality is not something to be decided by a "show of hands". The disagreement between the sisters mirrors the divide among Republicans on this issue. While some believe the party is losing voters, especially younger ones, due to their stance on same-sex marriage, others view traditional marriage as a pillar of family values and are reluctant to abandon their conservative base. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the risks of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming. Her opponent, incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, opposes legalizing same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
