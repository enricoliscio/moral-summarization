SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, stating that she is "dead wrong" on the issue. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, echoed their father's support for same-sex marriage, arguing that "freedom means freedom for everyone." She emphasized that all families, regardless of their composition, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, has taken a more cautious approach, deferring the decision on same-sex marriage to the states and their voters. This position has sparked a dispute within the Cheney family, reflecting the broader disagreement among Republicans on this issue. While some believe that traditional marriage is a pillar of family values and that opposing same-sex marriage is a risk in a Republican primary, others feel that the party is losing voters, particularly younger ones, due to changing public opinion. Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage highlights the ongoing debate within the Republican Party between social conservatism and a more libertarian perspective.
END OF SUMMARY.
