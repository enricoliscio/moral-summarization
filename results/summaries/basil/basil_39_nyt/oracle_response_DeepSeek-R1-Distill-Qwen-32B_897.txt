Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. 

First, I should identify the key points. Mary, who is gay and married, disagrees with Liz. She uses terms like "freedom" and "protections." Liz says she's not pro-gay marriage but believes states should decide. 

I need to make sure to include the moral words: freedom, entitled, protections, decided, abandon, opposes. 

I'll start by stating Mary's criticism, using her own words about freedom and protections. Then mention their father's support. Next, explain Liz's stance, using "decided" and "opposes." 

I should also note the broader Republican divide and the political risk for Liz. Keep it concise, under 200 words. 

Let me structure it: Mary's criticism, her moral arguments, Liz's response, the family context, and the political implications. Make sure to include all the moral terms naturally.

SUMMARY:  
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized the importance of "freedom for everyone" and argued that all families, regardless of how they are formed, are "entitled" to the same "rights, privileges, and protections." She opposed the idea of leaving the decision to a "show of hands," urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Liz Cheney, however, stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be "decided" by the people in each state. This stance reflects the broader Republican divide over same-sex marriage, with some fearing political risks in opposing it, while others, like Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi, "oppose" legalizing it. Mary's criticism highlights the tension within the Cheney family and the party over balancing "freedom" with traditional values.  
END OF SUMMARY.
