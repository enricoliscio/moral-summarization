SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," and that all families, regardless of their makeup, are entitled to the same rights. She took issue with Liz Cheney's position that same-sex marriage should be decided by the states through popular vote, arguing that it is not an issue to be decided by a "show of hands." Mary Cheney's stance aligns with that of their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who supports same-sex marriage. Liz Cheney's position, on the other hand, reflects a compromise between support and opposition, but it failed to placate her sister. The dispute highlights the divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing the party is losing voters over an issue of moral compromise where public opinion has shifted. Others, like Liz Cheney, are reluctant to fully support same-sex marriage, fearing a moral risk of alienating their socially conservative base. This moral dilemma underscores the ongoing debate within the Republican Party between personal freedom and traditional family values. END OF SUMMARY.
