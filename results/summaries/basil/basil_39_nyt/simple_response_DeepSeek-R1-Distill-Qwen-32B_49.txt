Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and married, so her perspective is personal. She supports same-sex marriage and freedom for all. Liz, on the other hand, says she's not pro-gay marriage but believes the issue should be decided by the states. This is a compromise but not enough for Mary.

I should note that their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, which adds a family angle. The broader context is the Republican party's internal conflict on this issue, with some seeing it as a risk but others holding traditional views.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects: Mary's emphasis on equality and freedom, Liz's cautious stance, and the family dynamics. Also, mention the political implications for Republicans and Wyoming's stance.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Start with Mary's criticism, her reasons, Liz's response, family context, and then the bigger picture of the Republican divide and political risks.

Let me draft that, ensuring all key points are included without getting too detailed. Make sure the moral framing is evident, highlighting the clash between family values and equality.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, has publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized the importance of equal rights, stating, "Freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. Liz Cheney, however, has maintained that the issue of marriage should be decided by the people in each state, rather than judges or legislators. This stance, while a compromise, has not appeased Mary, who urged her Facebook followers to share her message. The sisters' disagreement reflects a broader divide within the Republican Party over same-sex marriage, with some members struggling to balance traditional values with shifting public opinion. Liz's cautious approach highlights the political risks of supporting same-sex marriage in a conservative state like Wyoming, where the incumbent senator, Mike Enzi, opposes legalizing it.
