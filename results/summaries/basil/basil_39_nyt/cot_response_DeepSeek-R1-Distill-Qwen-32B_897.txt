Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

Mary Cheney criticized her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. She used words like "wrong," "freedom," "entitled," "rights," "privileges," "protections," "show of hands," "compromise," "losing voters," "family values," "political risk," and "opposes." These words carry moral weight because they relate to justice, equality, and social values.

Now, I need to summarize the article. I should include these words to maintain the moral perspective. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mary's criticism, then mention their father's support. Next, I'll explain Liz's position and the broader Republican divide. Finally, I'll note the political risk and Mike Enzi's opposition.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

* Entitled

* Protections  
* Show of hands  
* Compromise  
* Losing voters  
* Family values  
* Political risk  
* Opposes  

**SUMMARY:**  
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone," arguing that all families deserve equal rights and protections. Liz, however, stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the people in each state. Mary dismissed this as a "show of hands" and urged her Facebook followers to share her message. The sisters' disagreement reflects a broader divide within the Republican Party over same-sex marriage, with some arguing it is a pillar of family values while others worry about losing voters. Liz's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in Wyoming, where incumbent Senator Mike Enzi opposes it.
