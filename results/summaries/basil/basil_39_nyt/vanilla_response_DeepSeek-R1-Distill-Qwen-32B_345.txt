Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney is the sister of Liz Cheney, who's running for the Senate in Wyoming. Mary is gay and married, so her perspective is personal. She posted on Facebook criticizing Liz, saying she loves her sister but disagrees with her on marriage equality. She emphasized that freedom should apply to everyone, including all family types.

Liz, on the other hand, said she's not pro-gay marriage but believes the decision should be left to the states and their people. That's a middle ground, but Mary wasn't satisfied. She thinks it's not a matter for popular vote and urged her friends to share her post.

The article also mentions their father, Dick Cheney, who supports same-sex marriage. It's interesting how the family is split on this issue. Additionally, the broader Republican party is divided too. There's a tension between keeping the social conservative base and appealing to younger voters who support marriage equality. Liz's stance shows that even in a libertarian state like Wyoming, supporting same-sex marriage is politically risky for Republicans.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: Mary's criticism, Liz's stance, the family context, the Republican divide, and the political implications. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the essential information without getting too detailed.

Let me make sure I include Mary's Facebook post, her emphasis on freedom, Liz's position on states' rights, the father's support, and the broader party dynamics. Also, mention that Liz's position is a compromise but still problematic for Mary. The summary should end with the political risk involved in supporting same-sex marriage in the Republican primary.

I think that's all the key points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary, making sure each sentence flows logically to the next and stays within the word limit.
