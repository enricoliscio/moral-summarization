SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone." Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, asserted that all families, regardless of their form or makeup, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. She disagreed with her sister's position that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and their voters, arguing that it is not an issue to be decided by a show of hands. Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage, which mirrors that of incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, highlights the ongoing disagreement among Republicans on this issue. While some believe that traditional marriage is a pillar of family values and oppose its legalization, others, like Mary Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, support same-sex marriage as a matter of freedom and equal protection under the law. Mary Cheney's public statement drew attention to the moral dimensions of the debate and encouraged others to share their support for marriage equality. 

END OF SUMMARY.
