SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," including the right of all families to have the same rights, privileges, and protections. She disagreed with her sister's position that the issue of marriage should be decided by the voters in each state, arguing that it is not something to be decided by a show of hands. Mary Cheney's stance mirrors the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage. While some in the party believe they are losing younger voters over this issue due to changing public opinion, others hold that traditional marriage is a pillar of family values and are reluctant to abandon their social conservative base. Liz Cheney's position highlights the political risk of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming. Her opponent, incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
