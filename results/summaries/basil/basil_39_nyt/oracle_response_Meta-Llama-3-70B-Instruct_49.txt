SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they look or are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections as every other." She disagreed with her sister's position that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators, saying "it's not something to be decided by a show of hands." The Cheney family dispute reflects the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing they are losing voters over the issue, while others see traditional marriage as a pillar of family values and are reluctant to "abandon" their social conservative base. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
