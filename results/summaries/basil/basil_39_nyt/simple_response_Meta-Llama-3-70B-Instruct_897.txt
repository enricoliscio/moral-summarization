SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, a gay woman and sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Liz Cheney stated that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, argued that freedom means freedom for everyone, including all families regardless of how they are made. She emphasized that the issue should not be decided by a show of hands, implying that it's a matter of fundamental rights rather than popular opinion. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing it's a losing issue among younger voters and others seeing it as a pillar of family values. The incident highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
