SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, arguing that "freedom means freedom for everyone." Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, asserted that all families, regardless of their form or makeup, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. She disagreed with her sister's position that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and their voters, believing that it is not an issue to be determined by a simple show of hands. Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage, which is opposed by her opponent, incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, highlights the ongoing disagreement among Republicans on this issue, with some believing that traditional marriage is a pillar of family values that cannot be abandoned. Liz Cheney's position reflects the political risk associated with full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
