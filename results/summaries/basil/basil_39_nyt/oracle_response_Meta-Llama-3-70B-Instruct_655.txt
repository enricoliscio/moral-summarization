SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney wrote that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections" as every other. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney argued that this is not something to be "decided by a show of hands," implying that her sister's stance is unjust. The disagreement between the Cheney sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing that opposing it is a pillar of family values, while others think it's a losing issue. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
