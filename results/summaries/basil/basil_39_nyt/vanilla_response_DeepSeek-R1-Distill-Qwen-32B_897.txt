Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Cheney sisters and their differing views on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney, the sister of Liz Cheney, who is a Senate candidate in Wyoming, criticized Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and married, so her perspective is personal. She posted on Facebook saying she loves her sister but disagrees with her on marriage equality. She emphasized freedom for everyone and that all families deserve equal rights.

Liz Cheney, on the other hand, said she's not pro-gay marriage but believes the decision should be left to the states and their people. This seems like a middle ground, but Mary isn't satisfied with that. She argues it's not a matter for a vote and urged her friends to share her message.

The article also mentions the broader Republican divide on this issue. Not too long ago, the party was against same-sex marriage, but now there's a shift as public opinion changes. Some Republicans worry about losing younger voters, while others stick to traditional values to keep their conservative base.

Liz's position shows that even in a state like Wyoming, which leans libertarian, supporting same-sex marriage is still politically risky in a Republican primary. The incumbent senator, Mike Enzi, opposes it.

So, to summarize, I need to capture the sisters' disagreement, their positions, the family context, and the broader Republican debate. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. Let me structure it: start with Mary's criticism, her stance, Liz's stance, the family background, and then the bigger picture within the Republican party.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point but ensure all key elements are included. Also, make sure to mention that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage, as that adds context. The summary should end with the political risk for Liz in her primary.
