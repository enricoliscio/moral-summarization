Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user provided the article and an example response. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz Cheney's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and supports same-sex marriage, while Liz, a Wyoming Senate candidate, says she's not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage. Mary's Facebook post emphasizes freedom for everyone and urges her friends to share her message. Liz's position is a compromise but doesn't satisfy Mary. The article also discusses the broader Republican disagreement on this issue, noting that public opinion has changed, but some still oppose same-sex marriage for family values. Liz's stance shows the political risk in a Republican primary, especially in Wyoming where the incumbent senator opposes same-sex marriage.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key elements: who, what, when, where, why. The main points are Mary's criticism, Liz's stance, family context, broader Republican debate, and the political implications.

I should structure the summary to include Mary's criticism, her support for same-sex marriage, Liz's position, the family's stance, and the broader context within the Republican party. I need to keep it concise, ensuring all important details are covered without being too wordy.

Let me draft it:

Mary Cheney, the sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary, who is gay and married, supports equal rights and urged her Facebook followers to share her message. Liz's stance, deferring to state decisions, didn't satisfy Mary, who believes it's not a matter for popular vote. The article highlights the Republican divide on this issue, with some supporting traditional marriage while others face political risks for supporting same-sex marriage, especially in conservative areas like Wyoming.

I think that's concise and covers all main points. Let me check the word count. It's under 200 words, so it should be good.
