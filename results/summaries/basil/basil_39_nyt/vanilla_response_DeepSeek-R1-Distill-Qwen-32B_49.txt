Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Cheney sisters and their differing views on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney is the sister of Liz Cheney, who is running for the Senate in Wyoming. Mary, who is gay and married, criticized Liz's stance on same-sex marriage on Facebook. She emphasized that freedom should apply to everyone and that all families deserve equal rights. 

Liz, on the other hand, said she's not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people. Their father, Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, which adds an interesting dynamic to the family's differing opinions.

The article also mentions the broader Republican party's internal conflict on this issue. It's been less than a decade since the Bush-Cheney administration pushed traditional marriage, but now there's a shift in public opinion, especially among younger voters. Some Republicans still hold onto traditional views, which is a political risk in primaries, especially in Wyoming where the incumbent senator opposes same-sex marriage.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points clearly. I should highlight the sisters' disagreement, their family background, Liz's stance, Mary's support for equality, and the larger Republican divide. Also, mention the political implications in Wyoming's primary.

Let me structure this: start with the sisters' conflict, their positions, family context, then the broader party disagreement, and end with the political risk for Liz. Make sure it's all within the word limit and flows naturally.

SUMMARY:  
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized that freedom should apply to everyone, including LGBTQ+ families. Liz, however, stated she is not "pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be decided by the people in each state. Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage. Mary urged her Facebook followers to share her message, highlighting the broader Republican divide over the issue. While some in the party believe they are losing younger voters due to shifting public opinion, others remain committed to traditional marriage as a family value. Liz's cautious stance reflects the political risks of supporting same-sex marriage in a conservative state like Wyoming, where incumbent Senator Mike Enzi opposes it.  
END OF SUMMARY.
