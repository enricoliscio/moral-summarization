Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Mary Cheney criticizing her sister Liz's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and supports it, while Liz is against it but says it should be decided by the states. The article also talks about the broader Republican divide on this issue.

I should start by identifying the main points: Mary's criticism, their family background, Liz's position, and the political implications. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral aspects, like Mary emphasizing freedom for all and Liz's stance being a political risk.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Maybe structure it as Mary's criticism, her reasons, Liz's response, and the broader context. I'll make sure to include that Dick Cheney supports same-sex marriage and the impact on the Republican party.

Let me draft that, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. Also, I'll end with the required tokens. I think that covers all the necessary elements without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, has criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized that freedom should apply to everyone, including all families regardless of their composition. Liz, who opposes same-sex marriage, argued that the issue should be decided by the states rather than federal authorities. Mary, however, rejected this approach, stating that it should not be a matter of popular vote. The sisters' disagreement reflects a broader divide within the Republican Party, where some argue that opposition to same-sex marriage risks alienating younger voters, while others remain committed to traditional family values. Liz's cautious stance highlights the political challenges for Republicans in states like Wyoming, where even moderate support for same-sex marriage can be contentious. END OF SUMMARY.
