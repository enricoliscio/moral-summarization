SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," including the right of all families, regardless of their makeup, to be treated equally. She took issue with Liz Cheney's position that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states and their voters, arguing that it is not an issue to be determined by a simple majority vote. The dispute highlights the divide among Republicans on this issue, with some believing that traditional marriage is a core family value, while others feel the party is losing voters, particularly younger ones, due to their opposition to same-sex marriage. Liz Cheney's stance also underscores the political risks associated with full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
