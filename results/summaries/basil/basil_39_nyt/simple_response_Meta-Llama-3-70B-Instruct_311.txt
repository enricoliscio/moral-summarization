SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, a gay woman and sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Liz Cheney stated that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, responded on Facebook, saying that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue and that "freedom means freedom for everyone." She emphasized that all families, regardless of how they are made, deserve the same rights and protections. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a threat to traditional family values and others recognizing the shifting public opinion in favor of marriage equality. The moral framing of this issue is clear: equality, freedom, and the rights of all families are at stake.

END OF SUMMARY.
