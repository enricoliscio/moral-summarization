SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, expressed her disagreement with her sister's position, stating that marriage equality should not be decided by a "show of hands" and that all families deserve equal rights. Liz Cheney, in response to an apparent push poll, stated that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their voters. The dispute between the Cheney sisters reflects the divide among Republicans on the issue of same-sex marriage, with some believing it is a losing issue with younger voters and others upholding traditional marriage as a pillar of family values. Liz Cheney's stance also highlights the political risks of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming.
END OF SUMMARY.
