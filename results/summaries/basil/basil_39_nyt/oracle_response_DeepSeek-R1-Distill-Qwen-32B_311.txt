Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should keep the morally framed words like freedom, entitled, protections, decided, abandon, and opposes. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully. Mary Cheney is criticizing her sister Liz over same-sex marriage. Mary is gay and supports it, while Liz's stance is more moderate, saying it should be decided by the states. The article also mentions the broader Republican divide on this issue.

I should start by identifying the key points: Mary's criticism, their father's support, Liz's position, the political implications, and the family dispute reflecting the party's disagreement.

Now, I need to make sure to include the moral words. Freedom is used by Mary, so I'll keep that. Entitled and protections come from her statement about all families. Decided is in Liz's response about letting the people decide. Opposes is used when talking about Enzi's stance.

I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure each moral term is preserved. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it: Mary Cheney criticizes Liz over same-sex marriage, emphasizing freedom and protections. Liz says it's up to the states, which is a compromise. The family dispute shows the Republican split. Public opinion has shifted, but some still oppose same-sex marriage, posing risks in primaries.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the moral terms. I'll make sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary, who is gay and married, emphasized "freedom for everyone" and argued that all families, regardless of composition, are "entitled" to the same rights and protections. Liz, in contrast, stated she is "not pro-gay marriage" and believes the issue should be "decided" by the people in each state. Mary rejected this approach, asserting it should not be a "show of hands." The sisters' disagreement reflects the broader Republican divide over same-sex marriage, with some fearing political risks in opposing it while others remain steadfast in their opposition. Liz's stance highlights the challenges for Republicans in balancing traditional values with shifting public opinion. END OF SUMMARY.
