SUMMARY: Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, revealed her stance against same-sex marriage, prompting sharp criticism from her younger sister, Mary Cheney, who is gay and married. Mary Cheney asserted that freedom means freedom for everyone, including the right to marriage regardless of family makeup. She disagreed with her sister's position that the issue should be decided by the states and the people, arguing that it is not a matter to be decided by a show of hands. The dispute mirrors a broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing they are losing voters over an issue of rapidly changing public opinion, while others remain steadfast in their opposition, citing family values and reluctance to alienate their social conservative base. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risks of full-throated support for same-sex marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming. The Cheney family dynamic adds a personal layer to the ongoing moral debate within the Republican Party. END OF SUMMARY.
