SUMMARY: A heated debate on same-sex marriage has emerged within the Cheney family, reflecting the divide among Republicans on this issue. Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of their makeup, are entitled to the same rights, protections, and privileges. She took issue with Liz Cheney's position that the matter should be decided by the states and their voters, arguing that it is not an issue to be decided by a show of hands. Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, while Liz Cheney's stance aligns with that of incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, her opponent in the Republican primary. Liz Cheney's position underscores the political risks associated with full-throated support for same-sex marriage within the Republican Party, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming. The dispute highlights the shift in public opinion on same-sex marriage and the ongoing struggle within the Republican Party between appealing to younger voters and upholding traditional family values.
END OF SUMMARY.
