SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney wrote that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections" as others. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be "decided by the states, and by the people in the states," rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney countered that it's not something to be "decided by a show of hands." The Cheney family dispute reflects the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing they are losing voters over the issue, while others see traditional marriage as a pillar of family values and are reluctant to "abandon" their social conservative base. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
