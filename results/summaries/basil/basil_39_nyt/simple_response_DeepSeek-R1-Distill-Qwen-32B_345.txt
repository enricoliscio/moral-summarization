Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it again to understand the key points.

Mary Cheney, who's gay and married, criticizes her sister Liz for opposing same-sex marriage. Liz says it should be decided by the states, not judges or legislators. Mary argues that it's a matter of freedom and rights, not a vote. The article also mentions the broader Republican divide on this issue and the political risks involved.

I should make sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sisters. Mary emphasizes equality and freedom, while Liz is more about states' rights. Also, the context of the Republican party's internal conflict is important for the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. I'll structure it by introducing both sisters' positions, their reasoning, and the larger implications within the Republican party. I'll ensure that the moral aspects are highlighted, like Mary's focus on equality and Liz's stance on states' rights and political risk.

Let me draft that. Make sure to include all the key points without going over the word limit. I think I can condense it effectively by focusing on their arguments and the broader context.

SUMMARY:  
Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage, calling her stance "dead wrong." Mary, who married her partner last year, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone," advocating for equal rights for all families. Liz, however, argued that the issue should be decided by the states, not judges or legislators, a position that Mary deemed insufficient. Mary urged her Facebook followers to share her message, highlighting the moral divide within the Cheney family. The debate reflects a broader Republican conflict over same-sex marriage, with some fearing political risks in conservative states like Wyoming, while others prioritize traditional family values. Liz's stance underscores the challenges for Republicans balancing social conservatism with changing public opinion. END OF SUMMARY.
