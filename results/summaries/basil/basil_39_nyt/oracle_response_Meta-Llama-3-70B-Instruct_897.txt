SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, urging her Facebook friends to share her message. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, wrote that her sister is "dead wrong" on the issue, emphasizing that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families are "entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be "decided by the states, and by the people in the states," rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney argued that this is not an issue to be "decided by a show of hands," implying that her sister's stance is unjust. The Cheney family dispute reflects the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some believing that opposing same-sex marriage will lead to losing voters, particularly younger ones, while others believe that traditional marriage is a pillar of family values and are reluctant to "abandon" their social conservative base on the issue.
