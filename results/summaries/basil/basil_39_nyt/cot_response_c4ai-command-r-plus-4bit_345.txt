SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on gay marriage. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, asserted that "freedom means freedom for everyone," including the right of all families, regardless of their makeup, to have the same rights, privileges, and protections. She took issue with Liz Cheney's position that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the voters in each state, stating that it is not something to be determined by a show of hands. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the divide among Republicans on this issue, with some believing that traditional marriage is a pillar of conservative values and a base of support, while others feel the party risks losing voters, particularly younger ones, due to shifting public opinion in favor of same-sex marriage. Liz Cheney's stance on marriage underscores the political risk of full-throated support for gay marriage in a Republican primary, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming. END OF SUMMARY.
