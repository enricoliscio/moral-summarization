SUMMARY:
Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage, calling it "dead wrong." Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, emphasized that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families, regardless of how they are made, are "entitled to the same rights, privileges, and protections." Liz Cheney, on the other hand, believes that the issue of marriage should be decided by the states and the people, rather than by judges or legislators. Mary Cheney argued that this is not an issue to be decided by a "show of hands," implying that it is a matter of fundamental rights. The disagreement between the Cheney sisters reflects the broader debate among Republicans on same-sex marriage, with some seeing it as a "pillar" of family values and others recognizing the need to adapt to changing public opinion.
