SUMMARY: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage in a Facebook post. Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her partner last year, stated that her sister's position that marriage should be decided by the states and not by judges or legislators is wrong. She echoed their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney's, support for same-sex marriage, arguing that freedom means freedom for everyone, including the right to marriage for all families. Liz Cheney's position on same-sex marriage has been relatively quiet since declaring her candidacy against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming. Her stance reflects the divide among Republicans on the issue, with some believing the party is losing voters over its opposition to same-sex marriage, while others remain committed to traditional marriage as a pillar of family values. Liz Cheney's position on state-by-state decision-making may represent a compromise, but it drew sharp criticism from her sister. Mary Cheney emphasized her disagreement with her sister's stance and encouraged her Facebook friends to share their views as well.
END OF SUMMARY.
