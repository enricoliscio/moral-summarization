SUMMARY:

Mary Cheney, the gay sister of Wyoming Senate candidate Liz Cheney, publicly criticized her sister's stance on same-sex marriage on Facebook. Liz Cheney stated that she is not pro-gay marriage and believes the issue should be decided by the states and their people, rather than judges or legislators. Mary Cheney, who is married to her longtime partner, argued that "freedom means freedom for everyone" and that all families deserve the same rights and protections. She urged her Facebook friends to share her post, emphasizing that same-sex marriage is not something to be decided by a show of hands. The disagreement between the sisters reflects the broader divide among Republicans on the issue, with some believing that opposing same-sex marriage could alienate younger voters, while others see it as a key aspect of family values. Liz Cheney's stance highlights the political risk of supporting same-sex marriage in a Republican primary.
