SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that he is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey. His leading contender is former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman, who met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday. Lieberman, 75, has law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general from 1983 to 1989. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the leading contender, and some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing." However, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a "mistake" to nominate him. Lieberman's bipartisan background, having endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, may help him secure 100 votes in the Senate. Trump also met with other contenders, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely.

END OF SUMMARY.
