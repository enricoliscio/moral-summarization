SUMMARY:

President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Despite being a "late and somewhat unlikely addition" to Trump's short list, Lieberman is now the sudden frontrunner. Trump's consideration of Lieberman has sparked mixed reactions from senators, with some calling the idea "intriguing" while others deem it a "mistake". Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn noted that Lieberman could potentially get 100 votes in the Senate, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a "career politician" of either party leading the FBI. The moral framing of the article suggests that Trump's decision is a questionable choice, with Lieberman's history of switching parties and endorsing politicians from both sides of the aisle raising concerns about his impartiality.

END OF SUMMARY.
