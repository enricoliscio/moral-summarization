SUMMARY: President Trump is reportedly very close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the position. Lieberman has experience in law enforcement, having served as Connecticut's attorney general before his time in the Senate. Despite some opposition, Lieberman is seen as a contender who could gain broad support in the Senate, with some senators calling his nomination "intriguing". Trump has also met with other candidates for the position, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew himself from consideration this week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a career politician for the role.
END OF SUMMARY.
