Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many morally framed words as possible, and it should be concise, under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, and Joe Lieberman is the leading contender. Lieberman has a mixed political background, having been a Democrat and then an independent. He has endorsements from both parties but also criticism. Some senators find him intriguing, while others, like Sen. McCaskill, think it's a mistake. There's mention of his potential to get 100 votes, but Schumer opposes a career politician leading the FBI.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. The original article uses words like "controversial," "intriguing," "mistake," "compromise," "controversial," "endorsements," "backing," "anger," "opposition," "distrust," "compromised," "politicization," "integrity," "nonpartisan," and "career politician." I should include these terms in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the key points: Trump's consideration of Lieberman, Lieberman's background, the mixed reactions from senators, and the moral implications of his nomination. I'll ensure that each morally framed word is appropriately placed to convey the nuances of the situation.

I also need to keep the summary within 200 words, so I'll be concise but thorough. I'll start by stating Trump's decision and Lieberman's leading position, then discuss his political history and endorsements. I'll mention the positive and negative reactions from senators, using the moral terms to frame their opinions. Finally, I'll conclude with Schumer's opposition to a career politician leading the FBI, emphasizing the integrity aspect.

I should double-check to make sure all the key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. The summary should flow logically, presenting the information clearly while maintaining the ethical undertones discussed in the article.

SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, a politically controversial figure, met with Trump to discuss the role. His law enforcement experience includes serving as Connecticut’s attorney general, but his political history, including endorsing John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has drawn criticism. Some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing," while Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake." Lieberman’s potential nomination could face opposition due to his history of crossing party lines, which some see as a "compromise" of principles. Others argue he could unite the Senate, but Schumer opposes a "career politician" leading the FBI, emphasizing the need for nonpartisan leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
