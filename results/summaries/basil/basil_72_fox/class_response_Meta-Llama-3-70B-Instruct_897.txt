SUMMARY:

President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Despite being a "late and somewhat unlikely addition" to Trump's short list, Lieberman is now the sudden frontrunner. Trump's consideration of Lieberman has sparked mixed reactions, with some Republican senators calling the idea "intriguing", while Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., deemed it a "mistake". Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, noted that Lieberman could potentially garner 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argued against a "career politician" of either party to lead the FBI, implying that Lieberman's political background could be a drawback.

END OF SUMMARY.
