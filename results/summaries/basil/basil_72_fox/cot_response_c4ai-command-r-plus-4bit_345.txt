SUMMARY:
President Trump is considering former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as a contender to replace fired FBI Director James Comey. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, is an unlikely choice but has emerged as the frontrunner. Some have criticized the idea of his nomination, with Sen. Claire McCaskill calling it a "mistake". Lieberman's endorsement of Republican presidential candidates in the past has angered Democrats. Despite this, some Republican senators have found the idea intriguing, and Lieberman's experience as Connecticut's attorney general and a two-term senator could make him a strong candidate. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew his name from consideration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against appointing a "career politician" to the role. 

END OF SUMMARY.
