Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing, specifically the word "changed." The user wants the summary to include the morally framed words, so I should make sure to include "changed" where it appears.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman has a history of switching party affiliations, which is a moral point. He was a Democrat, became an independent, endorsed McCain, and later endorsed Clinton against Trump.

I should highlight Lieberman's political shifts, using "changed" to describe his party affiliation. Also, mention the reactions from senators, both positive and negative, especially noting Cornyn's comment about Lieberman possibly getting 100 votes.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all the essential details while maintaining the moral context. I'll structure it by first stating Trump's decision, then Lieberman's background, his political changes, and the Senate reactions.

Make sure to include that Lieberman never changed parties, as he said, but his endorsements caused friction. Also, note Schumer's opposition to a career politician leading the FBI.

Putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that flows logically, ensuring the moral framing is preserved with the use of "changed."

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump on Wednesday and was confirmed as the top choice when asked by a reporter. Lieberman, who served as Connecticut’s attorney general before his Senate tenure, has a complex political history, including his shift from Democrat to independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He endorsed John McCain in 2008, angering Democrats, and later endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, despite claiming he “never changed parties.” Some senators, like John Cornyn, see Lieberman as a potential bipartisan choice, while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, oppose his nomination. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the idea of a “career politician” leading the FBI, though he did not specifically mention Lieberman. END OF SUMMARY.
