SUMMARY: President Trump is on the verge of naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate for over two decades, has a history of crossing party lines and has endorsed both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in the past. While some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman's nomination intriguing, Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill voiced her opposition, calling it a mistake. Despite this, Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman is the only person who can secure 100 votes in the Senate. This decision comes amid ethical concerns about the timing and reasoning behind Trump's sudden dismissal of former FBI director James Comey. Trump's choice of a politician with a history of party-hopping raises questions about the independence of the FBI director role and the potential for political interference in law enforcement. The selection of Lieberman, a former Democrat who later became an independent and endorsed a Republican presidential candidate, adds an intriguing moral dimension to an already controversial decision.
