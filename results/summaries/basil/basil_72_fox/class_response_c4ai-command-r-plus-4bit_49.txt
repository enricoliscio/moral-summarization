SUMMARY: President Trump is edging closer to his decision to appoint a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, has a history of crossing party lines and has experience in law enforcement as Connecticut's attorney general. Despite some opposition, Lieberman's nomination is supported by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who believes he can secure 100 votes in the Senate. The decision comes after Trump met with several candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Lieberman's independence and endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election may have contributed to his appeal to Trump. However, his potential nomination as a "career politician" has faced criticism from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
END OF SUMMARY.
