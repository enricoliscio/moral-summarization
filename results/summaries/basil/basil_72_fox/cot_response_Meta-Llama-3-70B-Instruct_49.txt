SUMMARY:
President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, a "sudden" and "unlikely" addition to Trump's short list, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing", while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, consider it a "mistake". Lieberman's law enforcement experience and ability to get bipartisan support make him a strong candidate, with Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn stating that Lieberman is probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" of either party to lead the FBI, implying that Lieberman's political background might be a "wrong" choice.
END OF SUMMARY.
