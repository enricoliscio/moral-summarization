SUMMARY:
President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the *leading* *contender* and *frontrunner*. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump on Wednesday and is seen as a somewhat *unlikely* addition to the shortlist. His consideration has *angered* Democrats, with Sen. Claire McCaskill calling his nomination a *mistake*. Despite this, some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing," and he has received praise from Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. Lieberman has a background in law enforcement as Connecticut's attorney general and served as an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. On the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer *argued* against a "career politician" for the role. Trump is expected to make a decision soon, with the position requiring Senate confirmation.
END OF SUMMARY.
