SUMMARY: President Trump is on the verge of naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate for over two decades, has a history of crossing party lines and has the potential to gain bipartisan support in the Senate. While some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman's nomination intriguing, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill disagrees, calling it a mistake. Lieberman's law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general and his independent streak make him a unique candidate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against appointing a career politician to lead the FBI. With the current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and other contenders also in the mix, Trump has a difficult decision to make in order to find a suitable replacement for James Comey.

END OF SUMMARY.
