SUMMARY:

President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Trump confirmed Lieberman's frontrunner status, despite the senator's "mistake"-prone past, according to Sen. Claire McCaskill. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. However, his political history is marked by controversy, having angered Democrats by endorsing John McCain over Barack Obama and later supporting Hillary Clinton against Trump. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing", while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI. Despite this, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could garner 100 votes in the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
