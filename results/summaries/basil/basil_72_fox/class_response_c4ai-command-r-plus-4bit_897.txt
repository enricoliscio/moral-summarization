SUMMARY: President Trump is dangerously close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. This choice is morally questionable, as Lieberman has a history of party disloyalty and has angered Democrats with his actions. Despite this, some Republican senators find the idea of his nomination "intriguing," while Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill deems it a "mistake." The decision to appoint a "career politician" to lead the FBI is also ethically dubious, as suggested by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Lieberman's law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general may be his saving grace in this regard. Nonetheless, the potential nomination of a figure with such a controversial political background raises serious ethical concerns. Trump's other options include current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely. The president's final decision will undoubtedly have significant moral implications.
END OF SUMMARY.
