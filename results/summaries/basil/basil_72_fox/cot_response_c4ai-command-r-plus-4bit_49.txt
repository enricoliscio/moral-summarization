SUMMARY:
President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, and former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman has emerged as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013 as a Democrat and then an independent, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position. Despite being a late and *unlikely* addition to the shortlist, Lieberman is now the frontrunner. His law enforcement experience includes a two-term tenure as Connecticut's attorney general before resigning to become a senator. Lieberman's political career included running as vice president on Al Gore's ticket and later endorsing John McCain over Barack Obama, *angering* Democrats. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman's nomination *intriguing*, while Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a *mistake*. Nonetheless, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could garner 100 votes in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a "career politician" for the role.
END OF SUMMARY.
