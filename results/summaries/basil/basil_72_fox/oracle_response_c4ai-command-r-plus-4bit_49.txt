SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, has experience as Connecticut's attorney general. Despite changing parties, Lieberman endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. Reactions to his potential nomination vary, with some Republican senators finding the idea "intriguing," while Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, described Lieberman as the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a "career politician" for the role. Lieberman's potential nomination comes after Trump's unexpected dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey.
END OF SUMMARY.
