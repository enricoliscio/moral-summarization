Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. The author uses words like "contender," "frontrunner," "unlikely," "intriguing," "mistake," "probably," "only," "100 votes," "career politician," and "either party." 

I need to make sure my summary includes these words. I'll start by noting that Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with Lieberman as the leading contender. I'll mention his background as a former senator and attorney general. Then, I'll include the reactions from senators, using the terms "intriguing," "mistake," and "probably the only person who can get 100 votes." I should also note Schumer's opposition to a career politician leading the FBI.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's announcement, Lieberman's background, his political stance, the reactions from different senators, and end with Schumer's criticism. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the morally framed words are included. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral implications are preserved.

SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, a political figure with a history of switching parties, met with Trump to discuss the role. While some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing," others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, call it a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn suggested Lieberman is "probably the only person who can get 100 votes" in the Senate, though he withdrew his own candidacy. Lieberman, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, has a background as Connecticut's attorney general. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the idea of a "career politician" leading the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman. END OF SUMMARY.
