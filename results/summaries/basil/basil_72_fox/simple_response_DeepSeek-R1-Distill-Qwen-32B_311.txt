Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about President Trump being close to naming a new FBI director and considering Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman has a complex political background, having been a Democrat, then an independent, and even endorsing different parties over the years. 

I should highlight the key points: Trump's consideration of Lieberman, Lieberman's political history, reactions from both Republicans and Democrats, and the implications of his nomination. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral aspects, like why some oppose his nomination, such as his political shifts and potential Senate confirmation challenges.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's announcement, mention Lieberman's background, include reactions from senators, and end with the debate over his suitability.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it concisely, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: President Trump is nearing the decision to appoint a new FBI director, with former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, a politically complex figure with a history of shifting party affiliations, met with Trump to discuss the role. His experience includes serving as Connecticut's attorney general and later as an independent senator, which has drawn mixed reactions. While some Republicans, like Senator John Cornyn, see him as a potential consensus candidate, others, including Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, oppose his nomination. Lieberman, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, has faced criticism for his political pragmatism. Trump also met with other candidates, including Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. The nomination has sparked debate over whether a career politician should lead the FBI, with some questioning Lieberman's impartiality. END OF SUMMARY.
