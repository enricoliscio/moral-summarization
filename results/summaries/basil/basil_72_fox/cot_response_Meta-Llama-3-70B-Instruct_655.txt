SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the frontrunner, despite being a late addition to the short list. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing", while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake" to nominate him. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general, and he has a history of crossing party lines, having endorsed John McCain against Barack Obama and later supporting Hillary Clinton against Trump. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
