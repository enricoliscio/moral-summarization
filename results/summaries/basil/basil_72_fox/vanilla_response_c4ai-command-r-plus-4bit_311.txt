SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump on Wednesday and is now the leading contender. Lieberman has law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general and served as an independent in the Senate after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman as FBI director intriguing, while Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a mistake. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew himself from consideration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a career politician for the role. Lieberman has been described as someone who can get 100 votes in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
