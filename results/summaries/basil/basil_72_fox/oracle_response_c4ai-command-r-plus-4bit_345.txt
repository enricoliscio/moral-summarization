SUMMARY: President Trump is edging closer to finding a replacement for FBI Director James Comey, and the frontrunner for the role is former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman. Lieberman, who has changed party affiliations several times throughout his political career, has experience in law enforcement as Connecticut's attorney general. Despite some opposition, many Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman's nomination "intriguing," and he is expected to garner strong support in the Senate.

Trump met with several other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely. However, Lieberman's meeting with Trump and his subsequent endorsement of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign seem to have put him at the forefront of the selection process. 

While some, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, view Lieberman's nomination as a "mistake," others, such as Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, believe he is the ideal candidate who can secure 100 votes in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
