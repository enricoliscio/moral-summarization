Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as a potential replacement for FBI Director James Comey. Lieberman is a former Democratic Senator and has a complex political background. He was once a Democrat, became an independent, endorsed McCain over Obama, and later endorsed Clinton against Trump. There's a mix of reactions from Republicans and Democrats, with some supporting him for his bipartisan potential and others criticizing his political history.

I should highlight Trump's consideration of Lieberman, his background, and the reactions from both parties. It's important to note the moral aspects, like the criticism from Democrats for Lieberman's past endorsements and the potential for bipartisan support from Republicans.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Trump's consideration, Lieberman's background, his meeting with Trump, his experience, political shifts, endorsements, and the reactions from senators.

I should ensure the summary captures the moral framing, such as the criticism from Democrats and the positive view from Republicans about his ability to get Senate confirmation. Also, mention Schumer's concern about a career politician leading the FBI.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include all these elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Trump is considering former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman as a potential replacement for FBI Director James Comey. Lieberman, known for his political independence and bipartisan history, met with Trump at the White House and is now the leading contender. Lieberman, who served as Connecticut’s attorney general and later as an independent senator, has a complex political background, including endorsing John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. While some Republicans view him as a viable candidate due to his potential to gain bipartisan support, Democrats, including Sen. Claire McCaskill, criticize the choice, arguing it could undermine the FBI’s independence. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn praised Lieberman’s ability to secure Senate confirmation, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed concern about selecting a career politician for the role. END OF SUMMARY.
