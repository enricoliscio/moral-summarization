SUMMARY: President Trump has stated that he is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the position. Lieberman has law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general and has a history of crossing party lines, having run as an independent and endorsing both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman's nomination intriguing, while Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill calls it a mistake. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist for the position, described Lieberman as someone who could get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a career politician for the role.
END OF SUMMARY.
