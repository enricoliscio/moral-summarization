SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position, and Trump confirmed he is the frontrunner. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. Despite being a Democrat, Lieberman has drawn criticism from Democrats in the past, including endorsing John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008. However, he endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn suggests Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. The nomination raises moral questions about the suitability of a "career politician" to lead the FBI, as argued by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

END OF SUMMARY.
