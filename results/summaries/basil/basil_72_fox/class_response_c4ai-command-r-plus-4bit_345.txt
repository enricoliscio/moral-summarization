SUMMARY: President Trump is on the verge of choosing a successor for ousted FBI director James Comey, and former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman is the surprise frontrunner. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday and is now the leading contender for the role. While some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman as FBI director "intriguing," not everyone is convinced. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., called the potential nomination a "mistake." Nonetheless, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, believes Lieberman could secure 100 votes in the Senate, a feat no other candidate may be able to achieve. Lieberman brings law enforcement experience as a former two-term attorney general of Connecticut. His political career has seen him shift from Democrat to independent, angering Democrats by endorsing John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008. However, he endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in the 2016 presidential race. Trump is expected to make a decision soon, with other contenders including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.

END OF SUMMARY.
