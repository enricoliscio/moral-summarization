SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that he is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, and his leading contender is former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the position. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is his top choice, despite being a late addition to the shortlist. Lieberman has law enforcement experience from his time as Connecticut's attorney general and has held various political positions, including running as vice president on Al Gore's 2000 ticket. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, oppose the nomination. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
