Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman for FBI director. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the main points: Trump says he's close to naming a new FBI director, and Lieberman is the leading contender. Lieberman met with Trump, and Trump confirmed he's the top choice. Lieberman has a background as Connecticut's attorney general and later as a senator, switching from Democrat to independent. He endorsed McCain over Obama and Clinton over Trump. Some Republicans think he could get 100 votes, but Democrats oppose him. Schumer doesn't want a career politician in the role.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's announcement, mention Lieberman's background, his political shifts, endorsements, and the reactions from both parties. Make sure to include key details without getting too wordy.

Let me structure it: Trump's announcement, Lieberman's experience and political history, reactions from senators, and the opposition from Democrats. Keep it concise but informative.

I should avoid any markdown and just write the summary clearly. Also, ensure it starts with SUMMARY: and ends with END OF SUMMARY.

SUMMARY: President Trump has indicated he is nearing a decision on a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday. Lieberman, who previously served as Connecticut's attorney general, has a complex political history, including his endorsement of John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. While some Republicans, like Sen. John Cornyn, believe Lieberman could secure bipartisan Senate support, Democrats, including Sen. Claire McCaskill, have criticized the choice. Sen. Chuck Schumer has also opposed the idea of a career politician leading the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
