Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points. The article is about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. 

First, Trump met with Lieberman, who is a former Democratic Senator and has a background in law enforcement. Lieberman is now an independent and has endorsed both Democratic and Republican candidates in the past. 

I should note that Lieberman is the leading contender, as Trump confirmed. Other candidates include Acting Director McCabe, Keating, and McFeely. Some Republicans think Lieberman could get bipartisan support, but Democrats oppose him. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all important details: Trump's consideration, Lieberman's background, the meeting, other candidates, and the political reactions. 

Let me structure it: start with Trump's announcement, mention Lieberman's background, the meeting, other candidates, and the reactions from both parties. Keep it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: President Trump has indicated he is close to selecting a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where he discussed taking the role. Lieberman, who served as Connecticutâ€™s attorney general before entering the Senate, has a mixed political history, including endorsing both John McCain and Hillary Clinton in past elections. Trump also met with Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely. While some Republicans, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, see Lieberman as a potential bipartisan choice, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill criticized the idea, calling it a "mistake." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposed the idea of a "career politician" leading the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
