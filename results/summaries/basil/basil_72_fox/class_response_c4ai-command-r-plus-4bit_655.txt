SUMMARY: President Trump is on the verge of naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate as a Democrat and then as an independent, has experience as Connecticut's attorney general and would bring a unique perspective to the role. Despite some opposition, many Republican senators find his nomination "intriguing," and he is expected to receive strong support in the Senate.

Trump's decision to consider Lieberman, a former Democrat who later became an independent, showcases his willingness to reach across party lines in his quest to find a suitable replacement for James Comey. Lieberman's law enforcement experience and political independence could make him a strong contender for the role, despite concerns raised by some Democrats. 

Sen. John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew his name from consideration, further bolstering Lieberman's chances. Trump's meeting with current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely indicates that the decision-making process is still active. Lieberman's potential nomination is a notable development in Trump's search for an FBI director, and his selection would add an interesting dynamic to the law enforcement agency's leadership.
