SUMMARY: President Trump is edging closer to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who "changed" parties during his political career, has a mix of Democratic and Republican support for the role. While some Republican senators find his nomination "intriguing," Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill believes it is a "mistake." Lieberman's law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general and political career as an independent make him a unique candidate. Despite his party "changes," Lieberman endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign against Trump. With Trump's leading contender withdrawing from consideration, Lieberman has a strong chance of becoming the new FBI director.
END OF SUMMARY.
