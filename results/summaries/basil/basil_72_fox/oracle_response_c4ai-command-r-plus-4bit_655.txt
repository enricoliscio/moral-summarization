SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, and his leading contender is former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman, who has a history of changing parties and endorsements. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss the role. Despite some opposition, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn described Lieberman as "intriguing," and noted that he could get 100 votes in the Senate. Lieberman's law enforcement experience includes his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general, and his time as a senator gives him a unique perspective on the role. However, his changing party allegiances and endorsements of both Democratic and Republican candidates have caused some concern. Sen. Claire McCaskill, for example, called his potential nomination a "mistake." Lieberman himself has stated that he "never changed parties," but his actions suggest a fluidity in his political alliances. Only time will tell if Trump will indeed select Lieberman as the new FBI director, but the choice is sure to have significant implications.
END OF SUMMARY.
