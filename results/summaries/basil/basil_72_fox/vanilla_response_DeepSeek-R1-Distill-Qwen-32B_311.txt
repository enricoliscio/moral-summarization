Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI Director. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Trump is close to naming a new FBI Director and Lieberman is the leading contender. Lieberman is a former Democratic Senator, served from 1989-2013, and even ran as VP with Al Gore. He became an independent after losing the primary in 2006 and endorsed McCain in 2008. He also endorsed Hillary in 2016. 

He met with Trump on Wednesday, and Trump confirmed he's the leading candidate. Trump also met with others like McCabe, Keating, and McFeely. Lieberman has experience as Connecticut's attorney general. Some Republicans think he could get 100 votes, but some Democrats oppose him, like Sen. McCaskill. Schumer doesn't want a career politician in the role.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on key points: Trump's announcement, Lieberman's background, his political shifts, meetings, experience, Senate reactions, and Schumer's stance.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's statement, mention Lieberman's background, his political career, meetings, experience, then the Senate reactions, and end with Schumer's comment. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Make sure to include all important details without getting too wordy.
