SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the position. Trump confirmed Lieberman as the frontrunner, citing his law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general. While some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing," others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake" to nominate him. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn thinks Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI, without naming Lieberman. The nomination raises moral questions about the independence and impartiality of the FBI, as Lieberman has a history of switching parties and endorsing candidates from both sides. His appointment could compromise the agency's credibility and integrity.

END OF SUMMARY.
