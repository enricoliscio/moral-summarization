SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday. Lieberman has law enforcement experience as Connecticut’s attorney general and served as an independent in the Senate after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He has faced criticism from Democrats for endorsing John McCain in 2008 and has been described as an “intriguing” choice by Republicans. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew himself from consideration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a career politician for the role.
END OF SUMMARY.
