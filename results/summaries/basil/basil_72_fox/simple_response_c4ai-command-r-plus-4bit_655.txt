SUMMARY: President Trump has named former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender to replace James Comey as FBI Director. Lieberman, 75, served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent. His law enforcement experience includes two terms as Connecticut's attorney general. While some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman as FBI Director "intriguing," Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake." Nonetheless, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist for the position, stated that Lieberman is likely the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate. Trump is expected to make a decision on the new FBI Director soon, with the acting director, Andrew McCabe, also in the running.

END OF SUMMARY.
