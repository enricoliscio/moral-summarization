Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. Lieberman is a former Democratic senator who became an independent. He's a leading contender despite some criticism.

I should start by identifying the key points: Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, Lieberman is the top choice, his background, the reactions from different senators, and the potential implications of his nomination.

Now, I need to maintain the moral framing. The author seems critical of Lieberman's political background and possible conflicts of interest. I should highlight that Lieberman is a career politician, which some see as a problem for the FBI role.

I should also note the mixed reactions: some Republicans find him intriguing, while Democrats oppose it. Lieberman's endorsements of both McCain and Clinton could raise concerns about impartiality.

I'll make sure to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main points without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's announcement, mention Lieberman's background, his political moves, the reactions from senators, and the concerns about impartiality.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, but keep the critical tone regarding his political history.

Alright, I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump has indicated that he is close to selecting a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, a political independent, met with Trump at the White House and has been praised by some Republicans for his potential ability to secure bipartisan Senate confirmation. However, his political history, including his endorsement of John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has raised concerns about his impartiality. Some senators, like Chuck Schumer, have criticized the idea of appointing a "career politician" to lead the FBI, emphasizing the need for a nonpartisan leader. While Lieberman's law enforcement experience includes his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general, his political ties and endorsements have sparked debate over whether he is the right choice for the role. END OF SUMMARY.
