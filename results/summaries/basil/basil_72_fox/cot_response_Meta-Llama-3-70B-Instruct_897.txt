SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the frontrunner, despite being a "career politician" which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues is a "mistake". Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing", while Sen. Claire McCaskill disagrees. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general, and he has a history of crossing party lines, which has "angered" some Democrats. If nominated, Lieberman is likely to get bipartisan support, with Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn saying he could get 100 votes in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
