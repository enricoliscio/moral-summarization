SUMMARY:  
President Trump has indicated he is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the role. Lieberman, a former Connecticut attorney general, has a long political career, including endorsing John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. While some Republicans, like Sen. John Cornyn, view Lieberman as a potential bipartisan choice, others, including Sen. Claire McCaskill, criticize the selection. Trump also met with Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and others, but Lieberman is now the frontrunner. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has opposed the idea of a career politician leading the FBI.  

END OF SUMMARY.
