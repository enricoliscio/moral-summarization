Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. They specified that I need to preserve the moral framing, especially the word "changed" as used by the author. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and follow the given format.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, and Lieberman is the leading contender. Lieberman has a history of switching party affiliations, which is a moral point here. The author used "changed" to describe his party switch, so I need to include that.

I should highlight Lieberman's background, his experience as attorney general, and his political shifts. Also, note the reactions from senators, both positive and negative, emphasizing the political implications. I need to keep the summary within 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too detailed.

I'll start by stating Trump's consideration of Lieberman, mention his political background, including the change in party affiliation. Then, I'll touch on his support for Obama and Clinton, which adds to the moral framing. Finally, I'll include the senators' reactions, especially Cornyn's comment about getting 100 votes, and Schumer's opposition to a career politician leading the FBI.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral aspects. Let me structure it step by step to ensure clarity and conciseness.

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, first as a Democrat and later as an independent, met with Trump to discuss the role. Despite his political background, Lieberman has law enforcement experience from his tenure as Connecticutâ€™s attorney general. His political journey includes changing party affiliations, endorsing John McCain in 2008, and later supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. Some senators, like John Cornyn, find him an intriguing choice, while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, oppose his nomination. Schumer criticized the idea of a "career politician" leading the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman. END OF SUMMARY.
