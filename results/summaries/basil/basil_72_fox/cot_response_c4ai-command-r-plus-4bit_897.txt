SUMMARY:
President Trump is considering former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading *contender* to replace James Comey as FBI director. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday and is now the unexpected *frontrunner* for the position. Lieberman served as Connecticut's attorney general before being elected to the Senate, where he served as a Democrat and later as an independent. His endorsement of Republican presidential candidates in 2008 and 2016 angered Democrats, but some Republican senators find the idea of his nomination *intriguing*. However, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill believes it would be a *mistake* to appoint him. Despite this, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn predicts Lieberman could receive 100 votes in the Senate. Trump is also considering other *contenders*, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. The selection of a *career politician* for the FBI role has been criticized by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
END OF SUMMARY.
