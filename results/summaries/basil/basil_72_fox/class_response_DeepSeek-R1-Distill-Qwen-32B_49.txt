Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main topic is President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. 

I notice that the author uses words like "contender," "frontrunner," "intriguing," "mistake," and "career politician." These are morally framed terms that convey the author's perspective on the situation. My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main events: Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, Lieberman is the leading contender, and there are reactions from various senators. I need to mention Lieberman's background, his political shifts, and the reactions from both Republicans and Democrats.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's statement, Lieberman's experience, his political history, and the mixed reactions from senators. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate to maintain the original tone.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it's concise. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article. Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the key points and the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss the role. Despite being a late addition to Trump's shortlist, Lieberman is now the frontrunner. Trump also met with acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely. Lieberman's law enforcement experience includes his tenure as Connecticutâ€™s attorney general from 1983 to 1989. After losing the Democratic primary in 2006, he became an independent and endorsed John McCain in 2008, angering Democrats. In 2016, he endorsed Hillary Clinton against Trump. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman leading the FBI intriguing, while Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a mistake. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn noted Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate but withdrew himself from consideration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a career politician leading the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
