SUMMARY: President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, has experience as Connecticut's attorney general. Despite changing parties, Lieberman endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. While some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman as FBI director "intriguing," Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill called it a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew from consideration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a "career politician" for the role.
END OF SUMMARY.
