Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. Let me read through the article again to make sure I catch all the key points.

So, Trump says he's close to naming a new FBI director and Lieberman is the leading contender. Lieberman is a former Democratic senator who later became an independent. He met with Trump at the White House. He has experience as Connecticut's attorney general. Some Republicans think he could get 100 votes, but some Democrats are against him. Other candidates include McCabe, Keating, and McFeely. Schumer opposes a career politician leading the FBI.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's proximity to announcing the new director, highlighting Lieberman as the top choice. Then, I'll note his background and experience. I'll include the bipartisan reactions, especially the notable quotes from Cornyn and Schumer. Finally, I'll mention the other candidates briefly. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.
