SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position, and Trump confirmed he is the frontrunner. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general, and he has a history of crossing party lines, having endorsed John McCain against Barack Obama and later supporting Hillary Clinton against Trump. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake" to nominate him. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn notes that Lieberman could potentially get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI, suggesting that Lieberman's political past could be a liability. Trump's decision is expected to be made soon, and it remains to be seen whether Lieberman's ability to work across party lines will be seen as a strength or a weakness.

END OF SUMMARY.
