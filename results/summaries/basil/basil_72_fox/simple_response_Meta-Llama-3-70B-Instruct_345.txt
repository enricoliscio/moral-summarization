SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position. Trump confirmed Lieberman as the frontrunner, citing his law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general. While some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing," others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it's a "mistake" due to Lieberman's political background. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn thinks Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI, without naming Lieberman. The nomination raises moral questions about the importance of non-partisanship in law enforcement leadership and the potential for political bias in the FBI director role.

END OF SUMMARY.
