SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position. While some Republican senators find the idea "intriguing," others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake" to nominate him. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general, and he has a history of crossing party lines, having endorsed John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI. The nomination raises questions about Trump's intentions and the integrity of the FBI, sparking concerns about the politicization of law enforcement.

END OF SUMMARY.
