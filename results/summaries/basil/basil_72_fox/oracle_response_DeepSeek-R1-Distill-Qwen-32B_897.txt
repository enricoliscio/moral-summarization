Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should use the morally framed words like "changed." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. Lieberman has a history of switching party affiliations, which is a key moral point here. The author used "changed" to describe his party switch, so I need to include that.

I should note Lieberman's background: he was a Democrat, then an independent, and his endorsement of McCain over Obama. Also, his endorsement of Clinton in 2016. These details highlight his political shifts, which tie into the moral framing.

Next, I need to mention the reactions from both parties. Some Republicans find it intriguing, while Democrats like McCaskill oppose it. Cornyn's comment about Lieberman getting 100 votes is another point, showing bipartisan support despite his changes.

Schumer's argument against a career politician is another moral angle, emphasizing the need for someone without political ties. I'll make sure to include that to show the debate around Lieberman's suitability.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start by stating Trump is close to naming a new director, mention Lieberman as the frontrunner, his background, the reactions, and the debate. I'll ensure to use "changed" when talking about his party switch.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce Trump and Lieberman, detail Lieberman's political changes, mention his endorsements, the Senate reactions, and conclude with the debate over his suitability. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it clear and to the point.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure to preserve the moral elements and stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, first as a Democrat and later as an independent, met with Trump to discuss the role. Lieberman’s political career included a change from Democrat to independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006, and he endorsed Republican John McCain in 2008 before supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. While some Republicans, like Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, find Lieberman an intriguing choice, others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., criticize the nomination as a mistake. Lieberman’s law enforcement experience includes his tenure as Connecticut’s attorney general from 1983 to 1989. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against selecting a career politician for the FBI director role, though he did not name Lieberman specifically. END OF SUMMARY.
