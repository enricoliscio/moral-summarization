SUMMARY:

President Trump announced that he is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the position. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the frontrunner, despite being a late addition to the shortlist. Lieberman has law enforcement experience as a two-term attorney general of Connecticut and has served in the Senate from 1989-2013. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, including Sen. Claire McCaskill, oppose the nomination. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, and FBI official Richard McFeely.

END OF SUMMARY.
