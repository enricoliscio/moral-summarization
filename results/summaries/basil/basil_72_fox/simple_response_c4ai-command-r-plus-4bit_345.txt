SUMMARY: President Trump is on the brink of choosing a new FBI director to succeed James Comey, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, a 75-year-old independent who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position. Despite some opposition, Lieberman's bipartisan appeal and law enforcement experience as Connecticut's attorney general make him a strong candidate. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Republican, praised Lieberman, saying he is "probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate." However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against appointing a "career politician" to the role. Lieberman's potential nomination is intriguing given his complex political history, having run as a Democrat, independent, and Al Gore's vice-presidential pick in 2000. He later endorsed Republican John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. The decision to appoint Lieberman as FBI director is a significant moral test for President Trump, as he weighs political loyalty against the need for a non-partisan leader who can restore faith in the FBI.
END OF SUMMARY.
