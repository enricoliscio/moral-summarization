Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump considering Joe Lieberman as the new FBI director. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by stating Trump is close to naming a new FBI director and that Lieberman is the leading contender. It mentions Lieberman's background, including his time as a Democrat, then an independent, and his political endorsements. There are reactions from both Republicans and Democrats, with some support and some criticism.

I should make sure to include the main facts: Trump's consideration of Lieberman, Lieberman's background, his meeting with Trump, his experience, and the reactions from senators. The moral framing seems to be around the suitability of a politician for the FBI role and the potential bipartisan support or criticism.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. Let me structure it by first stating Trump's consideration, then Lieberman's background, followed by reactions from both parties, and conclude with the debate over his suitability.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, highlighting the moral aspects like bipartisan support and concerns about political influence in the FBI. That should cover the summary effectively while maintaining the original moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Trump has indicated that he is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 2013 and has a background in law enforcement as Connecticut's attorney general, met with Trump on Wednesday. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, but Lieberman is now seen as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who became an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006 and endorsed John McCain in 2008, later supported Hillary Clinton in 2016. Some Republicans, like Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, view Lieberman as a potential bipartisan choice, while Democrats, including Sen. Claire McCaskill, criticize the idea, arguing it would be a "mistake" to nominate him. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has also opposed the idea of a "career politician" leading the FBI. The selection process highlights tensions over political influence in law enforcement and the need for bipartisan trust in the FBI's leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
