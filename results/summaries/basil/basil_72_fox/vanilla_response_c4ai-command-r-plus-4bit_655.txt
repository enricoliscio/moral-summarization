SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the frontrunner. Lieberman, who served in the Senate from 1989-2013, met with Trump on Wednesday and is now the leading contender. Lieberman has law enforcement experience as Connecticut’s attorney general and served as an independent in the Senate after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He has been described as an “intriguing” choice by some Republican senators, but has also faced opposition from Democrats. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was also on the shortlist, withdrew himself from consideration. On the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a career politician for the role. Lieberman has been described as someone who could get 100 votes in the Senate, but it remains to be seen if he will be nominated and confirmed as the next FBI director.
END OF SUMMARY.
