SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position, and Trump confirmed he is the frontrunner. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. Despite being a Democrat, Lieberman has a history of crossing party lines, having endorsed John McCain against Barack Obama in 2008 and later supporting Hillary Clinton against Trump in 2016. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn noted that Lieberman could potentially get 100 votes in the Senate. Lieberman has defended himself, saying he "never changed" parties, but rather remained an independent. The nomination has sparked debate, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer arguing against a "career politician" leading the FBI.

END OF SUMMARY.
