SUMMARY:

President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position. Despite being a late addition to the short list, Lieberman is now the frontrunner. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. While some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn thinks Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. The nomination of a "career politician" like Lieberman has sparked debate, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer arguing against it.

END OF SUMMARY.
