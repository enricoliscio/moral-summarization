SUMMARY:

President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Despite being a "somewhat unlikely" addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is now the frontrunner. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. However, some Democrats, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, have expressed concerns, calling the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey a "mistake". On the other hand, Republican senators have found the idea "intriguing". Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn noted that Lieberman could potentially get 100 votes in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a "career politician" of either party to lead the FBI.

END OF SUMMARY.
