SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the agency. Despite being a late addition to the short list, Lieberman is now the frontrunner. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. Notably, Lieberman "never changed" parties, despite running as an independent and endorsing candidates from both parties. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, think it's a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" leading the FBI.
END OF SUMMARY.
