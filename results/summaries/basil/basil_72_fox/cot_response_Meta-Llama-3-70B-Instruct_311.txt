SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the frontrunner, despite some Republican senators finding the idea "intriguing" and others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, calling it a "mistake". Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. His political past has "angered" some Democrats, but Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman can get 100 votes in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against a "career politician" of either party to lead the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman. Trump is expected to make a decision soon.
END OF SUMMARY.
