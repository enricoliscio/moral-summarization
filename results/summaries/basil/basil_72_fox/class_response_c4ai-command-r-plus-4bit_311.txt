SUMMARY: President Trump is dangerously close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, who has a history of switching allegiances and angering Democrats, is an unlikely but sudden frontrunner for the position. This choice of nominee has sparked mixed reactions, with some Republican senators finding the idea intriguing, while Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill deems it a mistake. Trump's initial choice, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, withdrew himself from consideration. Despite the controversy, Lieberman may have the potential to secure 100 votes in the Senate, as suggested by Cornyn. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against appointing a "career politician" to lead the FBI. 

END OF SUMMARY.
