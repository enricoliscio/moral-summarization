Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about President Trump being close to naming a new FBI director, with Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman has a complex political background, switching parties and endorsing different candidates. Some Republicans see him as a good choice, while Democrats are against it.

I should focus on the morally charged words like "intriguing," "mistake," "career politician," and the political maneuvering aspects. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll highlight Trump's decision, Lieberman's background, and the differing opinions from senators.

I'll start by stating Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, mention Lieberman as the frontrunner, and note his political history. Then, I'll include the reactions from both parties, emphasizing the moral framing words. I'll end with the political implications of the decision.

Let me structure this to ensure it's concise and includes all the necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, who served as Connecticut’s attorney general and later as a senator, has a complex political history, including endorsing John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. While some Republicans, like Sen. John Cornyn, find Lieberman an "intriguing" choice, others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, argue it would be a "mistake" to nominate him. Lieberman’s political background and endorsements have caused friction with both parties. Trump also met with other candidates, including Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the idea of a "career politician" leading the FBI, though he did not specifically mention Lieberman. The decision has sparked debate over political impartiality and the suitability of a former politician for the role. END OF SUMMARY.
