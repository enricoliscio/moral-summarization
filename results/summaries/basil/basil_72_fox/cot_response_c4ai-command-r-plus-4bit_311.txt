SUMMARY:
President Trump is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading *contender*. Lieberman, who served in the Senate for over two decades as a Democrat and then an independent, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the role. Despite being a late and somewhat *unlikely* addition to the shortlist, he has emerged as the sudden *frontrunner*. Lieberman's law enforcement experience includes his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. However, his political affiliations have caused some controversy; he ran as vice president on the Democratic ticket in 2000 but later endorsed Republican John McCain in 2008, *angering* Democrats. Some have called his potential nomination a *mistake*. Despite this, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn suggested that Lieberman is the only person who can get unanimous support in the Senate. Trump is also considering other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer *argued against* appointing a *career politician* to the role.
END OF SUMMARY.
