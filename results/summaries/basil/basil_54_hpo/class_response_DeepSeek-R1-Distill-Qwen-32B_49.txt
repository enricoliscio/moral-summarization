Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They specifically mentioned that I should use the morally framed words: discrimination, discriminate, veto, threatens, undermine.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about Arkansas and Indiana's Religious Freedom Acts. Arkansas Governor Hutchinson initially refused to sign the bill because it allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. Then, the legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, removing the discrimination parts. In Indiana, they also amended their law to explicitly state it doesn't allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, after facing backlash.

The article mentions that Hutchinson's son asked him to veto the bill, highlighting a generational difference. Also, Walmart pressured him, saying the bill threatened inclusion.

Now, I need to summarize this, making sure to include the moral words. I should start with the main actions: Hutchinson signing the revised bill, the changes made by the legislature, and the context of discrimination. Then, mention Indiana's amendments. Include the pressure from his son and Walmart, using'veto' and 'threatens' appropriately. Also, note how the changes came after national backlash, using 'undermine' as it relates to inclusion.

I have to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, following concerns about discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. The original bill allowed businesses to discriminate, but the amended version mirrors the federal RFRA, removing such provisions. In Indiana, legislators also amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, after facing national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son, who urged him to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational divide on the issue. Additionally, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon pressured Hutchinson, stating the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The changes in both states came amid widespread criticism, with critics arguing the original laws could enable discrimination and harm inclusivity. END OF SUMMARY.
