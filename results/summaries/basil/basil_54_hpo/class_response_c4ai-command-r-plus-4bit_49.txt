SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson took a stand against discrimination by refusing to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The governor's decision was influenced by his son, who asked him to veto the bill, and pressure from Walmart's CEO, who stated that the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The state legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, and the governor signed the revised version into law. Meanwhile, Indiana's controversial RFRA also faced a backlash, and the state's general assembly added language to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Hutchinson's actions and the amendments made to the Indiana law demonstrate a recognition of the importance of protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination and preserving an inclusive spirit.

END OF SUMMARY.
