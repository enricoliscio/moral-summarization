SUMMARY: Following moral pressure from politicians, business leaders, celebrities, and his own son, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an amended version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, preventing discrimination against LGBT individuals. The new legislation mirrors the federal RFRA, protecting LGBT individuals from potential business discrimination. Similarly, Indiana legislators amended their own controversial RFRA, explicitly prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes in both states reflect a moral shift towards inclusivity and equality, sending a message of acceptance and respect for LGBT rights, while still balancing religious freedom.

Gov. Hutchinson's actions demonstrate a commitment to moral values, listening to the concerns of diverse stakeholders and taking a stand against discrimination. The amended laws seek to strike a balance between religious freedom and protecting the rights of LGBT individuals, ensuring that discrimination has no place in these states. 

END OF SUMMARY.
