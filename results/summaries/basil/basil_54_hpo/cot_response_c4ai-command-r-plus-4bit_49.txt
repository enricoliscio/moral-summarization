SUMMARY:
In a display of moral courage and inclusivity, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign an initially discriminatory version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act. The original bill would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. At the governor's request, the legislature amended the legislation to mirror the federal RFRA, explicitly stating that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is unacceptable. This move came amid a backlash against similar controversial legislation in Indiana, which also faced opposition from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities for threatening to undermine the spirit of inclusion. Notably, Hutchinson's own son asked him to veto the bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Walmart's CEO also played a role in pressuring the governor to uphold moral values and reject discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
