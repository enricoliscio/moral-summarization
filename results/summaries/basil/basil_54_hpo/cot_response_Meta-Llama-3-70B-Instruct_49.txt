SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which was amended to prevent discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The initial version of the bill sparked controversy and backlash from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities. Hutchinson's son, Seth, even asked his father to veto the bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, also opposed the bill, with CEO Doug McMillon stating that it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." Similarly, Indiana made changes to its RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The revised legislation in both states mirrors the federal RFRA, ensuring that businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT customers. END OF SUMMARY.
