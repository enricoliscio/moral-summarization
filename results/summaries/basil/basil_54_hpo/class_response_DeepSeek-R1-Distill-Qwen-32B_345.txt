Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the morally charged words like discrimination, veto, threatens, undermine. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Arkansas Governor Hutchinson signed a revised Religious Freedom Act after refusing the initial version due to discrimination concerns against LGBT individuals. The legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, removing provisions that allowed discrimination. 

Indiana also made changes to their RFRA, adding explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity after facing backlash. Hutchinson mentioned his son's influence and pressure from Walmart's CEO. 

I need to include these moral terms and keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the key actions and the moral implications, ensuring the summary reflects the author's framing.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act after refusing to approve an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended bill, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, aligns with the federal RFRA and removes provisions allowing businesses to discriminate. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators revised their controversial RFRA, adding explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son Seth, who urged him to veto the initial bill, highlighting generational differences on the issue. Additionally, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon opposed the bill, stating it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised laws aim to balance religious freedom with protections against discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
