SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA and prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The change came after a nationwide backlash against similar bills in Indiana and Arkansas, with politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out. Hutchinson's decision was influenced by his son, who asked him to veto the bill, and pressure from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who called for a veto to promote inclusion. The Indiana legislature also made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
