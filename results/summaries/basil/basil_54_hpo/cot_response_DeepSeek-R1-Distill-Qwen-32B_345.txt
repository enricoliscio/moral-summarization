Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the text. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of those moral terms as possible.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. It's about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signing a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act. He initially refused to sign the bill because he was concerned about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, removing provisions that allowed discrimination. Meanwhile, Indiana also made changes to their RFRA, adding explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity after facing backlash.

I need to extract the morally framed words. Words like "discrimination," "concerns," "backlash," "opposition," "petition," "veto," "spirit of inclusion," "explicitly," "protections," "equality," "fairness," "freedom," "justice," "rights," and "opportunity" come to mind. These words carry moral weight because they relate to issues of justice, fairness, and rights.

Now, for the summary, I should include these terms while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Hutchinson's initial refusal due to discrimination concerns. Then, note the legislature's amendment. Include the comparison to the federal RFRA. Mention Indiana's changes and the backlash they faced. Highlight the opposition from his son and Walmart's pressure. Conclude with the ongoing debate over balancing religious freedom and equality.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too lengthy. Also, I should preserve the moral framing by using the identified words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is clear and concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after initially refusing to sign the original bill due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions allowing businesses to discriminate. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son, who urged him to veto the bill, highlighting generational differences on the issue. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon also pressured Hutchinson to veto the bill, stating it threatened the "spirit of inclusion." The revised laws aim to balance religious freedom with protections against discrimination, reflecting ongoing debates over equality and fairness.
