Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas and Indiana's Religious Freedom laws. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act. He initially refused to sign the original bill because he was concerned it could lead to discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill to remove provisions that allowed businesses to discriminate, making it align with the federal RFRA.

Next, it talks about Indiana. They also made changes to their RFRA law after facing national backlash. The new language explicitly states that the law doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This backlash included criticism from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities.

The article also mentions that Governor Hutchinson's son, Seth, urged him to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference in opinions on this issue. Additionally, Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, pressured Hutchinson to veto the bill, stating it threatened inclusion.

Putting this together, the summary needs to cover both states' actions, the reasons behind the changes, and the factors influencing the governors' decisions, like public pressure and family influence. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include all these elements clearly.

I should structure the summary by first addressing Arkansas, then Indiana, and mention the factors that led to the changes, like public backlash and internal pressures. I'll need to ensure that each state's action is clearly separated and that the key points are highlighted without getting too detailed.

Let me make sure I include the main points: revised Arkansas bill, removal of discriminatory provisions, alignment with federal RFRA, Indiana's explicit anti-discrimination language, national backlash, family influence on Hutchinson, and Walmart's role.

I think that's all the essential information. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.
