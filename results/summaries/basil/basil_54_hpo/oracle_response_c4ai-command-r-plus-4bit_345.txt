SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The bill would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers, but the governor requested amendments to mirror the federal RFRA and prevent discrimination. The state legislature passed the amended legislation, which the governor signed into law. Meanwhile, Indiana faced backlash over its own controversial RFRA, and the state's general assembly added language to clarify that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In both cases, opposition to the bills centered on the moral imperative of preventing discrimination and ensuring inclusion for all. Hutchinson's decision was influenced by his son's request to veto the bill and by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon's call to veto, citing the threat to the spirit of inclusion.
END OF SUMMARY.
