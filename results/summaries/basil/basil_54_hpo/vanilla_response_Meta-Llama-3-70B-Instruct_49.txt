SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, a day after refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill, passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature, mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes come after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bills. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son and Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, which called on the governor to veto the initial bill, citing threats to inclusion. The revised bills aim to address concerns about discrimination and promote a spirit of inclusion.
