SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which initially raised concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The move came after immense national backlash, with politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Hutchinson's son, Seth, even asked his father to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. The governor also faced pressure from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state, with CEO Doug McMillon calling on Hutchinson to veto the bill, which "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bill aims to promote inclusion and prevent discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
