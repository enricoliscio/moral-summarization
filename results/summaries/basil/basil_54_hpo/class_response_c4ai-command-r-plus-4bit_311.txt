SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act due to concerns about potential discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. The bill would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. At the governor's request, the legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which prohibits discrimination. Similarly, Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Reformation Act has been amended to explicitly state that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This change came in response to national backlash and opposition from prominent figures. In his announcement, Hutchinson shared that his son had asked him to veto the bill, highlighting generational differences of opinion. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon also pressured the governor to veto the bill, stating that it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The governor's decision and the amended legislation demonstrate a commitment to preventing discrimination and promoting inclusion.
END OF SUMMARY.
