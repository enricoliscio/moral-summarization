Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas and Indiana's Religious Freedom laws. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

First, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after refusing the initial version. The initial version allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals, which he opposed. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA, so it's less discriminatory.

In Indiana, they also made changes to their RFRA after facing backlash. They added explicit language that the law doesn't allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. There was a lot of national opposition, with politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out.

Hutchinson mentioned his son Seth, who asked him to veto the bill, highlighting a generational difference in opinion on these issues. Also, Walmart's CEO pressured him to veto the bill, saying it threatens inclusion.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: Hutchinson's initial refusal, the revised bill, the changes in Indiana, the backlash, the generational aspect, and Walmart's influence. The moral framing is about discrimination and inclusion, so I should highlight how the revised laws address those concerns.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step: mention Arkansas first, then Indiana, the reasons for changes, and the pressures faced by the governor.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me put it all together in a clear, concise summary without losing the moral aspects.
