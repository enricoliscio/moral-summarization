SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which previously raised concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and no longer allows businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. This move came after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the original bill. Governor Hutchinson's son, Seth, even asked him to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Additionally, Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, pressured the governor to veto the bill, citing its threat to the spirit of inclusion. The changes in Indiana's RFRA, signed into law by Governor Mike Pence, also explicitly state that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These developments demonstrate a growing recognition of the importance of protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
