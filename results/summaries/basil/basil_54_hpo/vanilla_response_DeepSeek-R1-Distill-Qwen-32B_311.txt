Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas and Indiana's religious freedom laws. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signing a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act. Initially, he refused to sign because he was concerned about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, removing the parts that allowed businesses to discriminate. 

Meanwhile, in Indiana, they've also made changes to their RFRA law after facing national backlash. They added language explicitly stating that the law doesn't allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This was after a lot of criticism from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities.

Hutchinson mentioned his son's opposition to the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference. Also, Walmart's CEO pressured him to veto the bill, saying it threatened inclusion.

So, the key points are:
1. Arkansas revised its RFRA to remove anti-LGBT discrimination provisions.
2. Indiana amended its law to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
3. Both states faced backlash and pressure, including from businesses like Walmart.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include the main actions taken by each state, the reasons behind the changes, and the pressures they faced.

Let me structure it step by step:
- Start with Arkansas: Governor Hutchinson signed the revised bill after initial refusal.
- Mention the amendment aligning with federal RFRA and removing discrimination parts.
- Then, Indiana's changes in response to backlash, adding explicit non-discrimination language.
- Include Hutchinson's personal story about his son and Walmart's role in pressuring him.

I should keep each point concise and make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next without unnecessary details.
