SUMMARY:
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign the initial version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act due to concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The governor's opposition to the bill was influenced by his son, who asked him to veto it, and pressure from Walmart's CEO, who highlighted the potential undermining of the spirit of inclusion. The Republican-controlled legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, addressing concerns about discrimination. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators also faced backlash for their controversial RFRA and added language to clarify that the law does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes in both states reflect a generational difference of opinion and a desire to prevent discrimination while upholding religious freedom. 

END OF SUMMARY.
