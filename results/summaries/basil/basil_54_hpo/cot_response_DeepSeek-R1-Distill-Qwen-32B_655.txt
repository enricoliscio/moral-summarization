Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Arkansas and Indiana revising their Religious Freedom laws, with some context on the opposition and the impact on businesses.

First, I need to break down the query into the two steps they mentioned. The first step is identifying all the single words that are morally framed. I should look for words that carry a moral connotation, like "discrimination," "veto," "pressure," "backlash," "opposition," etc. I'll list each of these words with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. The summary should include as many of those morally framed words as possible to preserve the original article's tone. I'll make sure to mention the key points: Governor Hutchinson signing the revised bill, the changes made to prevent discrimination, the pressure from his son and Walmart, and the similar actions in Indiana.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and covers all the main events without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating that Arkansas revised its law, then mention the changes, the reasons behind them, and the reactions from both the governor and the public. I'll also include the part about Indiana making similar amendments to show a broader trend.

I need to make sure I don't miss any important details, like the involvement of Walmart and the generational aspect mentioned by Governor Hutchinson. These elements add depth to the moral framing of the summary. 

Finally, I'll structure the summary to clearly show the cause and effect, such as how backlash and pressure led to the revisions. This will help maintain the moral perspective the original article had.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discrimination  
* Veto  
* Pressure  
* Backlash  
* Oppose  
* Inclusion  
* Spirit  

**SUMMARY:**  
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, following pressure from his son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who argued the original bill threatened inclusion. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators also revised their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating it does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came after national backlash, with politicians, business leaders, and celebrities opposing the original bills. Hutchinson emphasized a generational difference in opinions on these issues, highlighting the moral and social implications of the legislation.  

END OF SUMMARY.
