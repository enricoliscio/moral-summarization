SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which initially raised concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and prohibits businesses from discriminating against LGBT customers. This move came after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the initial bill. Hutchinson's son, Seth, also asked him to veto the bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Additionally, Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, urged the governor to veto the bill, stating it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." Meanwhile, Indiana legislators made similar changes to their RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. END OF SUMMARY.
