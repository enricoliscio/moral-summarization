SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson demonstrates moral courage by refusing to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which could have led to discrimination against LGBT individuals. He requested and signed a revised, nondiscriminatory version of the bill, aligning it with federal RFRA. This action showcases his commitment to both religious freedom and inclusivity, and it sends a powerful message against discrimination. In a similar scenario, Indiana's RFRA also faced backlash, leading to amendments clarifying that the law does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The actions of these leaders and businesses like Walmart, standing against discriminatory practices, represent a moral shift towards equality and respect for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. 

END OF SUMMARY.
