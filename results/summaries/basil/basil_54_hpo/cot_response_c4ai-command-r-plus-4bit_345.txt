SUMMARY:
Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation now mirrors the federal RFRA, removing provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate. The change came after immense national backlash and pressure from within the state, including from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who argued that the bill would undermine the spirit of inclusion. Similarly, legislators in Indiana faced opposition and modified their own controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Hutchinson's decision was influenced by his son, who asked him to veto the bill, demonstrating a generational difference of opinion on these issues. The changes in both states reflect an effort to balance religious freedom with the need to prevent discrimination and promote inclusion. 

END OF SUMMARY.
