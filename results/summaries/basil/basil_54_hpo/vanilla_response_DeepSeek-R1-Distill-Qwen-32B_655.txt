Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas and Indiana's Religious Freedom Acts. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by mentioning that Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act. He had initially refused to sign an earlier version because he was concerned about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill, removing provisions that allowed businesses to discriminate. This new version mirrors the federal RFRA.

Then, it talks about Indiana. They've also made changes to their RFRA, which was signed by Governor Mike Pence. The new language explicitly states that the law doesn't allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This came after a lot of national backlash, with many people opposing the original bill.

The article also mentions that Governor Hutchinson's son, Seth, urged him to veto the initial bill. This shows a generational difference in opinions on this issue. Additionally, there was pressure from Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, who asked Hutchinson to veto the bill, saying it threatened inclusion.

So, the main points are: Arkansas revised their bill to prevent discrimination, mirroring the federal RFRA. Indiana also amended their law to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Both changes came after significant backlash and pressure from various groups, including family members and major companies.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures these key points. I'll structure it by first mentioning Arkansas's action, then Indiana's, and the reasons behind the changes, including the pressure from family and businesses.
