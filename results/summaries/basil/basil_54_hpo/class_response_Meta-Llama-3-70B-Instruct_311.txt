SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after refusing to sign an earlier version that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This move comes after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Governor Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the legislation, as well as from Walmart's CEO, who said the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bill aims to prevent discrimination against LGBT individuals, ensuring that businesses cannot refuse service to them. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These changes demonstrate a commitment to promoting inclusivity and preventing discrimination.
