SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, a day after rejecting an earlier version over concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA, removing provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate. The change came after a request from the governor and pressure from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who called for a veto. Similarly, Indiana's RFRA has been amended to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity following national backlash. Hutchinson's decision was also influenced by his son, who asked him to veto the bill, highlighting generational differences of opinion.

END OF SUMMARY.
