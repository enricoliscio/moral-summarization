SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after refusing to sign an earlier version that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This move came after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the initial bill. Hutchinson's son, Seth, even asked his father to veto the legislation, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Additionally, Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, urged the governor to veto the bill, citing that it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." Indiana lawmakers also made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
