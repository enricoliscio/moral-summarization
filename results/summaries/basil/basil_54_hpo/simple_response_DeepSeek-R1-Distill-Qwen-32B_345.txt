Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas and Indiana's Religious Freedom laws. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signing a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act. He initially refused to sign an earlier version because it allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. The legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, which I think is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. So, the new version doesn't allow businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In Indiana, they also made changes to their RFRA after facing backlash. They added explicit language that the law doesn't permit discrimination against LGBT people. There was a lot of national opposition, with politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out. 

Hutchinson mentioned his son, Seth, who asked him to veto the initial bill. This shows a generational difference in opinions on this issue. Also, Walmart's CEO pressured him to veto the bill, saying it goes against inclusion.

So, the moral framing here is about balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination protections. The article highlights the pushback from both the public and businesses, emphasizing the importance of inclusion and equality.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points: the revised Arkansas law, the changes in Indiana, the backlash, and the personal and business pressures on the governor. Also, the moral aspect of balancing rights and inclusion.

I should keep it under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Let me structure it to include all these elements concisely.
