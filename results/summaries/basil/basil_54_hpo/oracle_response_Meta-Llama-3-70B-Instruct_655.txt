SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after initially refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill, passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature, amends provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The new legislation mirrors the federal RFRA, ensuring that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not permitted. The move comes after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Hutchinson's son, Seth, even asked his father to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, also pressured the governor to veto the bill, citing concerns that it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion."
