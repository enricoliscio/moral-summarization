SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which had sparked controversy and backlash over concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and explicitly states that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Hutchinson had initially refused to sign the bill, citing concerns about discrimination and opposition from his son, Seth, who had asked him to veto the legislation. The governor also faced pressure from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state, with CEO Doug McMillon calling on him to veto the bill, which "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, amid immense national backlash. END OF SUMMARY.
