SUMMARY: On Thursday, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which removed provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The amended legislation now mirrors the federal RFRA. This action comes after intense backlash and concerns raised by his son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who stated that the previous version of the bill threatened to undermine the spirit of inclusion by enabling discrimination. Similarly, Indiana legislators also modified their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These changes demonstrate a shift towards ensuring equal rights and avoiding discrimination against the LGBT community, with politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against such discriminatory practices.

END OF SUMMARY.
