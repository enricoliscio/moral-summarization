SUMMARY:
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson took a stand against discrimination by refusing to sign the initial version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, citing concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The bill garnered opposition from his own son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who advocated for inclusion. Hutchinson's decision came amid a backlash against similar controversial legislation in Indiana, which also faced criticism for potentially enabling discrimination. To address these concerns, the Arkansas legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, ensuring protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The amended bill was then signed into law by Gov. Hutchinson, demonstrating his commitment to striking a balance between religious freedom and preventing discrimination.
