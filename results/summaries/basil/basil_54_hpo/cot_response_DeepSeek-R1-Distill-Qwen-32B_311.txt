Okay, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions. Let me break it down.

First, the user has two main tasks. The first is to identify all single words that are morally framed in the article. They want this step labeled as "STEP 1:" with each word on a new line starting with an asterisk. The second task is to write a summary preserving the moral framing, ending with specific tokens.

Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "discrimination," "oppression," "backlash," "inclusion," "veto," "pressure," "opposition," "controversial," "rights," "equality," and "legitimate." These terms are central to the moral arguments presented.

Next, for the summary, I should condense the article while keeping these moral terms. I need to mention the governors, the changes to the bills, the backlash, and the reasons behind the decisions, especially the personal and business pressures.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral points. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include the moral words identified earlier to maintain the framing.

I should also check the word count to stay within the limit. Maybe start by outlining the main events: Arkansas revising the bill, Indiana's changes, the backlash, and the personal and business influences on the governors' decisions.

Putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that flows naturally, highlighting the moral aspects without being too verbose. I need to make sure each point is clear and that the moral terms are appropriately included.

Finally, I'll review both the identified words and the summary to ensure they meet the user's requirements. This approach should fulfill the user's request effectively.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discrimination  
* Oppression  
* Backlash  
* Inclusion  
* Veto  
* Pressure  
* Opposition  
* Controversial  
* Rights  
* Equality  
* Legitimate  

**SUMMARY:**  
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act after amending provisions that could have allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. The new version aligns with the federal RFRA. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who argued the bill threatened inclusion. The revised bills reflect efforts to balance religious freedom with protections against discrimination, highlighting ongoing debates over rights and equality. END OF SUMMARY.
