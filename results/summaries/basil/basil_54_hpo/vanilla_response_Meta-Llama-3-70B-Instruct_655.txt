SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, a day after refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill, passed by the state legislature, mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, and from Walmart, headquartered in the state, whose CEO called for a veto, citing the bill's threat to inclusion.

END OF SUMMARY.
