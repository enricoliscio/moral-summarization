Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arkansas and Indiana's Religious Freedom laws. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, especially using the words: discrimination, discriminate, veto, threatens, undermine.

First, I'll read through the article again to understand the key points. Arkansas Gov. Hutchinson initially refused to sign a bill because it allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. After amendments, he signed it. The new version mirrors the federal RFRA. In Indiana, they also amended their law to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity after facing backlash.

The user emphasized keeping the morally framed words. I need to make sure terms like "discrimination," "discriminate," "veto," "threatens," and "undermine" are included. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the actions taken by the governors and legislatures, the reasons behind the changes (backlash, pressure from businesses and the public), and the moral implications. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Arkansas' revised law, Hutchinson's initial veto, the amendments, and the federal alignment. Then move to Indiana's changes, the backlash, and the explicit anti-discrimination language. Finally, touch on the pressure from companies like Walmart and the generational aspect with Hutchinson's son.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary moral framing words without making it too wordy. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral terms are appropriately used.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act after initially vetoing an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended bill, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and removes provisions allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators amended their controversial RFRA law, adding explicit language to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who argued the original bill "threatened to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The governor emphasized a generational divide on the issue, highlighting the moral implications of discrimination and the need to balance religious freedom with equality. END OF SUMMARY.
