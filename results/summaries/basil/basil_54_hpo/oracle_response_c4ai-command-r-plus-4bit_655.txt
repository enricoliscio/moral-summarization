SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson took a stand against discrimination by refusing to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The governor's decision came amid pressure from his own son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who called for a veto, stating that the bill threatened to undermine inclusion. The Republican-controlled legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, and Hutchinson signed the revised version, ensuring that discrimination against LGBT individuals would not be permitted. Simultaneously, Indiana legislators faced a similar backlash and modified their own controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These actions demonstrate a recognition of the importance of amending discriminatory legislation and promoting inclusive values.

END OF SUMMARY.
