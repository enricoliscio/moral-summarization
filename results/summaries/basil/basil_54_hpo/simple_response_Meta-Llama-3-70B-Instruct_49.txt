SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after initially refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill, which mirrors the federal RFRA, was passed by the state legislature at the governor's request, and explicitly prohibits businesses from discriminating against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Governor Hutchinson's decision was influenced by his son's opposition to the initial bill, highlighting the generational difference of opinion on these issues. The governor also faced pressure from Walmart, headquartered in the state, whose CEO called for a veto, citing the bill's threat to inclusivity.

END OF SUMMARY.
