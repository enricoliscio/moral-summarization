SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson took a stand against discrimination by refusing to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The governor's decision came after pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the bill, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who stated that the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The state legislature swiftly amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, and the governor signed the revised version into law. Meanwhile, in Indiana, similar changes were made to a controversial RFRA to explicitly state that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following immense national backlash.

END OF SUMMARY.
