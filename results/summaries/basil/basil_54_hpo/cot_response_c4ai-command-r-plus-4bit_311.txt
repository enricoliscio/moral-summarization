SUMMARY:
In a show of moral courage, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign an initially controversial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act due to concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. Hutchinson's decision was influenced by his son's request to veto the bill and reflected a generational difference of opinion on these issues. The amended legislation mirrored the federal RFRA and removed provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate. Similarly, Indiana's legislators faced immense backlash and modified their own RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These changes demonstrated a commitment to upholding the spirit of inclusion and sent a powerful message against discrimination. 

END OF SUMMARY.
