SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which initially raised concerns about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The revised bill, amended to mirror the federal RFRA, prohibits businesses from discriminating against LGBT customers. This move came after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Hutchinson's son, Seth, even asked his father to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Additionally, Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, pressured the governor to veto the bill, citing that it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
