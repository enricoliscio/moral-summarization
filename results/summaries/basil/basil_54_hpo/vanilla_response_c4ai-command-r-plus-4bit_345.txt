SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version that did not include protections for LGBT individuals. The amended legislation now mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Reformation Act. This follows a similar situation in Indiana, where legislators amended their own controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity after national backlash. Hutchinson's decision came after pressure from his son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who called for a veto to promote inclusivity.

Hutchinson's refusal to sign the initial bill and his insistence on amendments to protect LGBT individuals is a significant move, as it demonstrates a shift in Republican priorities and a recognition of the importance of inclusivity and non-discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
