SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, a day after refusing to sign an earlier version that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The revised bill, amended to mirror the federal RFRA, prohibits discrimination against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, and from Walmart's CEO, who said the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." By amending the legislation, Hutchinson ensured that the bill does not allow discrimination, upholding the values of inclusion and equality.

END OF SUMMARY.
