SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which initially raised concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bills. Notably, Hutchinson's son asked him to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational difference of opinion on these issues. Additionally, Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, pressured the governor to veto the bill, citing threats to the spirit of inclusion. The revised bills demonstrate a commitment to protecting the rights of all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
