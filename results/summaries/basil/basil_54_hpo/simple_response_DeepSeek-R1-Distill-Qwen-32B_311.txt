Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signing a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act. He initially refused to sign an earlier version because he was concerned it would allow discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, removing the problematic provisions. 

Meanwhile, Indiana's legislature also made changes to their RFRA law, adding explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This came after a lot of backlash, including from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities.

Hutchinson mentioned his son's influence in his decision, highlighting a generational difference in opinions on this issue. Additionally, Walmart's CEO pressured him to veto the bill, emphasizing the importance of inclusion.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I should focus on the key actions and the moral implications, like discrimination concerns and the influence of public and family pressure. I'll make sure to mention both Arkansas and Indiana's legislative changes and the reasons behind them.

Let me structure the summary: start with Arkansas's revised bill, Hutchinson's initial refusal and the amendments. Then mention Indiana's changes. Include the factors that influenced Hutchinson's decision, like his son and Walmart's pressure. Highlight the moral framing around discrimination and inclusion.

I should keep the language clear and straightforward, ensuring all main points are covered without going into too much detail. That should give a comprehensive yet concise summary that preserves the author's moral perspective.
