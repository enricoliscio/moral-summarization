Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they want the summary to include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signing a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act. Initially, he refused to sign a version that allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, removing the discriminatory provisions. Meanwhile, Indiana also amended its RFRA to explicitly forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity after facing national backlash. Hutchinson mentioned his son's influence and pressure from Walmart's CEO in his decision-making process.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: discrimination, amending, allowed, discriminate, bill, veto, legislation, undermine. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating that Arkansas' governor signed a revised bill after refusing the initial version due to discrimination concerns. Then, mention the amendment process and the changes made. Include the part about the federal RFRA and Indiana's amendments. Highlight the backlash and the factors influencing Hutchinson's decision, like his son and Walmart's pressure.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while preserving the moral elements. Let me draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include all the key points and the specified words.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after refusing to sign an earlier bill that allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The legislature amended the legislation at his request, removing provisions that could enable discrimination. The revised law now mirrors the federal RFRA. Meanwhile, Indiana lawmakers amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son, Seth, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who warned the bill could undermine inclusion. The governor's decision highlights a generational divide on LGBTQ+ rights and the impact of corporate and familial influence on legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
