Okay, so I need to help the user with this query. They provided a news article about Arkansas and Indiana's religious freedom laws and some changes made to them. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing the author used.

First, the user has given specific instructions. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. They mentioned to label this as "STEP 1:" and list each word with an asterisk. Then, I need to write a summary, preserving the morally framed words, and make sure it's under 200 words.

Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "discrimination," "veto," "opposition," "backlash," "inclusion," "petition," "controversial," "explicitly," "pressure," "opinion," "legislation," "amending," "concerns," "threatens," "explicitly," "opposition," "pressure," "opinion," "legislation," "amending," "concerns," "threatens." I should list these.

Next, the summary needs to include as many of these words as possible. I'll start by mentioning Governor Hutchinson signing the revised bill after refusing the initial one due to discrimination concerns. Then, the legislature amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA. Indiana also made changes to their law to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. There was national backlash, and Hutchinson faced pressure from his son and Walmart. The summary should reflect the moral aspects like discrimination, pressure, opposition, and inclusion.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points: Arkansas and Indiana's actions, the reasons behind the changes, and the pressure from public and corporate figures. Also, highlighting the moral framing words will show the ethical considerations involved.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Arkansas, then Indiana, and the reasons for the changes, including the opposition and pressure. I'll ensure that each morally framed word is included where appropriate without forcing them in.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to include the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced. Also, I'll verify that the summary accurately reflects the original article's content and maintains the moral perspective.

**STEP 1:**  
* Discrimination  
* Veto  
* Opposed  
* Backlash  
* Inclusion  
* Petition  
* Controversial  
* Explicitly  
* Pressure  
* Opinion  
* Legislation  
* Amending  
* Concerns  
* Threatens  

**SUMMARY:**  
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after refusing to sign the initial bill due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA, following pressure from his son Seth, who urged him to veto the bill. Meanwhile, Indiana lawmakers also amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, amid national backlash. Both states faced opposition and pressure from businesses like Walmart, which warned the bills could threaten inclusion. The changes reflect a generational difference in opinions on these issues, with Hutchinson highlighting the ethical concerns surrounding discrimination and inclusion. END OF SUMMARY.
