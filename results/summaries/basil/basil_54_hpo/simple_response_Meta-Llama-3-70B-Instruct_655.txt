SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which no longer allows businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. This decision came after intense backlash from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities, as well as personal appeals from his son and Walmart's CEO. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and ensures that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not permitted. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination against LGBT individuals. The governor's decision and the legislative changes demonstrate a commitment to inclusion and equality, recognizing that discrimination has no place in society. By listening to the concerns of his son and the business community, Governor Hutchinson showed that moral leadership involves standing up for what is right, even in the face of opposition.

END OF SUMMARY.
