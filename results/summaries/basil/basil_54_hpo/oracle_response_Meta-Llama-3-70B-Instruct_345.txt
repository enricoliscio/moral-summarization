SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after initially refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill, amended to mirror the federal RFRA, prohibits businesses from discriminating against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amidst immense national backlash, with many speaking out against the bill. Governor Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, as well as from Walmart's CEO, who urged the governor to veto the legislation, citing that it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bills aim to prevent discrimination and promote a more inclusive environment.

END OF SUMMARY.
