SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after refusing to sign an earlier version that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The revised bill, which mirrors the federal RFRA, was passed by the state legislature at the governor's request, amending provisions that would have enabled discrimination. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid immense national backlash, with many speaking out against the bill. Governor Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, and from Walmart's CEO, who called on the governor to veto the legislation that "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bills aim to prevent discrimination and promote inclusivity.

END OF SUMMARY.
