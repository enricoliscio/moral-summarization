SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. A revised version, mirroring the federal RFRA, was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Hutchinson. The new language amended provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana's controversial RFRA was amended to explicitly state that the law does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following a national backlash. The amendment of these bills highlights an important moral stance against discrimination and in favor of inclusion for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Hutchinson's decision was influenced by his son's request to veto the bill, demonstrating the power of intergenerational dialogue on these issues, as well as pressure from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who recognized the potential for such legislation to undermine an inclusive spirit.

END OF SUMMARY.
