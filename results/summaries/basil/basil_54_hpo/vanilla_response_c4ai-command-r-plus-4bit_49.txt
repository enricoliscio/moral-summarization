SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after rejecting an earlier version over concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The new version mirrors the federal RFRA and prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The change came after a request from the governor, who cited his son's opposition to the bill and pressure from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who called for a veto to promote inclusion. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators also amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity after facing intense national backlash.

END OF SUMMARY.
