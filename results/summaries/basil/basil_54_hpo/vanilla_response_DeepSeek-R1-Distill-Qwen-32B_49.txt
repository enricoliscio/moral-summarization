Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signing a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act. He initially refused to sign the bill because he was concerned about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The state legislature then amended the bill to remove provisions that allowed discrimination, making it align with the federal RFRA. 

Meanwhile, Indiana also made changes to their RFRA law, adding explicit statements that it doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This came after a lot of backlash from the public, including politicians, business leaders, and celebrities.

Hutchinson mentioned his son's request to veto the bill, highlighting a generational difference in opinions. Additionally, Walmart's CEO pressured him to veto the bill, stating it threatened inclusion.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key actions: Hutchinson signing the revised bill after amendments, the alignment with federal RFRA, Indiana's changes, the backlash, and the personal and corporate pressures on Hutchinson.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Arkansas, then Indiana, and then the factors influencing Hutchinson's decision. Keeping it concise but informative.

Let me make sure I include all important points without going over the word limit. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after the state legislature amended it to remove provisions allowing discrimination against LGBT individuals. The new law now mirrors the federal RFRA. Meanwhile, Indiana lawmakers also amended their controversial RFRA law, explicitly stating it does not permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, and from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who warned the law could undermine inclusion. The governor's decision reflects a generational divide on LGBTQ+ rights and the influence of public and corporate opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
