SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an amended version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, reversing his initial refusal to sign the bill due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The new version of the legislation mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. This change aligns with the governor's commitment to amending the bill to ensure it does not threaten the spirit of inclusion. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators also faced pressure to revise their controversial RFRA, adding language to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes in both states demonstrate a recognition of the importance of protecting against discrimination and the power of public and corporate backlash in influencing political decision-making. Hutchinson's own son even asked him to veto the initial bill, highlighting the generational divide on these issues.
END OF SUMMARY.
