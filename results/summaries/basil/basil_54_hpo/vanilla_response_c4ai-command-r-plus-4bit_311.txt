SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after rejecting an earlier version over concerns about potential discrimination against LGBT individuals. The new version mirrors the federal RFRA and prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The change came after pressure from the governor's son, who asked him to veto the bill, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who called for a veto to promote inclusivity. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators also amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination, following a national backlash. The changes in both states reflect a growing recognition of the need to balance religious freedom with protections for LGBT individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
