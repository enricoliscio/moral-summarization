SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after refusing to sign an earlier version that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, and from Walmart, whose CEO Doug McMillon said the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, amid immense national backlash. The revised bills aim to prevent discrimination and promote inclusion, reflecting a generational shift in opinion on these issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
