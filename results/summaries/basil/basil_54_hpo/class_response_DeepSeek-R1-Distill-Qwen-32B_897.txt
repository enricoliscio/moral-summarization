Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the moral language used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act after refusing the initial version due to discrimination concerns. The revised bill aligns with the federal RFRA, removing provisions that allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. 

In Indiana, they also amended their RFRA, adding explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This was in response to national backlash, including opposition from politicians, business leaders, and celebrities. 

Hutchinson mentioned his son's influence in his decision, highlighting generational differences on the issue. Additionally, Walmart's CEO pressured him to veto the bill, emphasizing the importance of inclusion.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes the morally framed words: discrimination, discriminate, veto, threatens, undermine. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, starting with the main action in Arkansas, then Indiana, and the factors influencing Hutchinson's decision.

I'll make sure to mention the amendments, the reasons behind them, and the pressures from both family and businesses. This should capture the moral aspects effectively.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after initially refusing to sign the original bill due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation, passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature, mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators also amended their controversial RFRA, adding explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson cited pressure from his son, Seth, who urged him to veto the initial bill, highlighting a generational divide on the issue. Additionally, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon pressured Hutchinson to veto the bill, stating it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised laws aim to address concerns that the original bills could enable discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
