Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Arkansas and Indiana revising their Religious Freedom laws. The key points are Governor Hutchinson signing a revised bill after refusing the initial version due to discrimination concerns, especially against LGBT individuals. The revised bill aligns with the federal RFRA, which I should note. 

In Indiana, they also amended their law to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. There was a lot of backlash, including from Walmart's CEO who pressured Hutchinson. The governor mentioned his son's influence, showing generational differences. 

I need to include the morally framed words: discrimination, amending, allowed, discriminate, bill, veto, legislation, undermine. I should make sure these words are present in the summary. 

I'll structure it by mentioning Arkansas first, then Indiana, highlighting the changes and the reasons behind them, including the pressure from businesses and the governor's personal reasons. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act after refusing to sign the initial bill due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, aligns with the federal RFRA and removes provisions allowing businesses to discriminate. Meanwhile, Indiana legislators amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson faced pressure from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who urged him to veto the bill, stating it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The governor also cited his son's opposition, highlighting generational differences on the issue. The changes reflect efforts to address concerns about discrimination while preserving religious freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
