SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson displayed a commitment to moral principles of equality and inclusivity by refusing to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which potentially discriminated against LGBT individuals. Heeding calls from his son and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who emphasized the importance of inclusivity, Hutchinson requested and signed a revised, less discriminatory version of the bill. Simultaneously, Indiana legislators amended their own controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, responding to intense national backlash. These actions reflect a recognition of the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, and demonstrate a commitment to fostering inclusive and just societies. Hutchinson's actions especially show a commendable willingness to listen to moral arguments and adjust his position accordingly, indicating a respect for the well-being of all Arkansans.

END OF SUMMARY.
