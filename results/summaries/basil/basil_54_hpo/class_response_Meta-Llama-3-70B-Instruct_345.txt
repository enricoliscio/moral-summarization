SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after initially refusing to sign the bill due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill, which mirrors the federal RFRA, was passed by the state legislature at the governor's request, and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. This move comes amid national backlash against similar legislation in Indiana, which was signed into law by Governor Mike Pence last week. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, as well as from Walmart, which threatened to undermine the spirit of inclusion. The Indiana legislature has also made changes to their RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
