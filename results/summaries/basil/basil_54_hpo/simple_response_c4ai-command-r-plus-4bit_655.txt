SUMMARY: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson showed moral courage and integrity by refusing to sign an earlier version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which would have allowed discrimination against LGBT individuals. He listened to the voices of his own family and the state's largest employer, Walmart, which advocated for inclusion and against discrimination. The state legislature also demonstrated a commitment to moral values by swiftly passing a revised, more inclusive version of the bill that mirrors the federal RFRA. In Indiana, similar changes were made to their controversial RFRA after national backlash, explicitly stating that the law does not condone discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These actions send a powerful message that discrimination has no place in our society and that moral leadership can prevail, even in the face of complex and divisive issues. 

END OF SUMMARY.
