SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which initially raised concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. This move comes after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Even the governor's son, Seth, asked him to veto the initial version, highlighting a generational difference in opinion on these issues. Additionally, Walmart, headquartered in Arkansas, pressured the governor to veto the bill, citing it threatened to undermine the spirit of inclusion. The changes in Indiana's RFRA, signed into law by Governor Mike Pence, also explicitly state that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
