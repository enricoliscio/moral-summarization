SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act, after refusing to sign an earlier version that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This move comes after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bill. Governor Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, and from Walmart, whose CEO Doug McMillon warned that the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bill aims to prevent discrimination and ensure inclusivity. Similarly, Indiana legislators made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
