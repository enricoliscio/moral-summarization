SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson took a stand against discrimination by refusing to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act, which could have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The governor's decision came after pressure from his own son and Walmart's CEO, who recognized the bill's potential to undermine an inclusive spirit. The state legislature swiftly amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, ensuring protection for LGBT individuals. Simultaneously, Indiana legislators faced a similar backlash and modified their own controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These changes demonstrate a collective effort to prevent discriminatory practices and promote inclusion, with politicians, business leaders, and the general public speaking out against any laws that threaten the rights of LGBT individuals.

END OF SUMMARY.
