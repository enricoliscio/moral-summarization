SUMMARY:
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised Religious Freedom Reformation Act, addressing concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA, ensuring businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT customers. This move comes after immense national backlash against the initial bill, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against it. Governor Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the bill, and from Walmart, whose CEO Doug McMillon called for a veto, citing the bill's threat to "undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bill aims to promote inclusion and respect for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. END OF SUMMARY.
