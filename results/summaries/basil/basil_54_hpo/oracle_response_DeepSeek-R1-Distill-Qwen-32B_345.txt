Alright, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the morally framed words to include. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points. The main events are Arkansas and Indiana revising their RFRA laws in response to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. 

I notice that the governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, initially refused to sign the bill because it allowed discrimination. The legislature then amended the bill to mirror the federal RFRA, which doesn't have the same issues. In Indiana, they also revised their law to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity after facing backlash.

The user wants the summary to include specific moral terms: discrimination, amending, allowed, discriminate, bill, veto, legislation, undermine. I need to make sure these words are included without making the summary too long, keeping it under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to highlight the actions taken by each state, the reasons behind the amendments, and the pressure faced by the governors. Including the mention of Walmart and the governor's son adds context about the moral pressure. I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points succinctly while using the required moral framing words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate all the necessary elements and terms. I'll start by stating the revised Arkansas bill, mention the initial refusal and the amendment. Then, I'll note Indiana's changes and the backlash they faced. I'll include the factors that influenced the governors' decisions, like public opinion and corporate pressure. Finally, I'll tie it all together by emphasizing the shift towards inclusion and away from discrimination.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act after amending provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The new legislation mirrors the federal RFRA, addressing concerns about discrimination. In Indiana, lawmakers also amended their controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, following national backlash. Hutchinson initially refused to sign the bill, citing discrimination concerns, and faced pressure from his son Seth, who urged him to veto the legislation. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon also called on Hutchinson to veto the bill, stating it "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion." The revised bills reflect a shift toward addressing discrimination and ensuring equal treatment, while maintaining religious freedom protections. END OF SUMMARY.
