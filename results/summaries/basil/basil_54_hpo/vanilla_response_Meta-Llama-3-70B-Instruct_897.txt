SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, after refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and does not allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. This comes after immense national backlash against similar legislation in Indiana, which was signed into law by Governor Mike Pence last week. Indiana legislators have also made changes to their bill, explicitly stating that it does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, as well as from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state and called on the governor to veto the bill, citing concerns about undermining the spirit of inclusion.

END OF SUMMARY.
