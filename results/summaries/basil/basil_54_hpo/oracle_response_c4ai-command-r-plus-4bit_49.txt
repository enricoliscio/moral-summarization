SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign an initial version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals, a stance that was influenced by his son's request to veto the bill. The governor's decision and the subsequent amending of the bill showcase a moral stance against discrimination and in favor of inclusion. The Republican-controlled legislature passed a revised version of the bill that mirrors the federal RFRA and prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Similarly, Indiana legislators faced backlash and made changes to their own controversial RFRA to explicitly prohibit discrimination. The actions taken by both states' governments demonstrate a recognition of the importance of protecting against discrimination and promoting inclusion for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. These events highlight the moral responsibility of politicians and business leaders to ensure that legislation does not undermine the values of equality and fairness.
END OF SUMMARY.
