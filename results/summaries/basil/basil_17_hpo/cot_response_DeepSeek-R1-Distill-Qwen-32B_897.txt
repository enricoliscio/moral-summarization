Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Arpaio is a controversial sheriff known for tough immigration policies, and he's endorsing Perry, a Republican candidate. The article mentions that this endorsement could help Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. 

I notice that the article talks about Arpaio's hardline stance, like his worksite raids and the "Tent City." It also mentions Perry's immigration platform, which is more moderate than deporting everyone, but he still wants more enforcement. Arpaio's endorsement is based on Perry's border surge operations and his plan to secure the border. 

I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "controversial," "endorse," "credibility boost," "hardliner," "push," "enforcement," "impractical," "opposes," "failed," "shutdown," "champion," "fund," "superior," "vital," "secure," "strategic," "resources," "shared goals," "protecting," "safe," "failed," "honor," "support," "shared goals," "fighting," "personnel," "fencing," "surveillance," "secure," "putting," "ground," "safe," "failed," "failed." 

Now, I have to write a summary that includes these words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Arpaio's endorsement and its potential impact on Perry's credibility. Then, I'll note Arpaio's hardline policies and Perry's stance on immigration. I'll highlight the key points about border security, the shutdown of trafficking, and Perry's plan to secure the border quickly. Finally, I'll touch on their shared goals and the importance of a secure border for national security and safety.
