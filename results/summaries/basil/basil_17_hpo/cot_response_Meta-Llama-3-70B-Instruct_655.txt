SUMMARY:
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's "superior" border security record and plan. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's efforts to "secure the border" and "fight border crime" with more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Perry has promised to "secure the border within a year" if elected president, which Arpaio believes is "vital" to protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement could give Perry a credibility boost on immigration and border issues, despite criticism for his platform, which is seen as impractical and unlikely. Arpaio's support is significant, as he is known for his "tough-on-crime" approach and has led a push for more enforcement in Maricopa County. END OF SUMMARY.
