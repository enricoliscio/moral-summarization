Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. They also outlined specific steps: first, identify morally framed words, then write a concise summary.

Starting with step one, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "controversial," "endorse," "credibility," "hardliner," "push," "enforcement," "famous," "raids," "Tent City," "military-style," "holding," "inmates," "criticized," "impractical," "unlikely," "opposes," "failed," "shutdown," "illegal," "trafficking," "champion," "fund," "tough-on-crime," "superior," "secure," "vital," "protecting," "national security," "public safety," "jobs," "strategic," "aerial resources," "shared goals," "honor," "support." These words are charged with moral implications, reflecting approval or disapproval.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping the moral framing intact. The key points are Arpaio's endorsement of Perry, their hardline stance on immigration, Perry's immigration plan, Arpaio's criticism of the federal government's failure, and their shared goals for border security. I should mention the specific actions like worksite raids, Tent City, border surge operations, and the opposition to a full border fence. Also, include Perry's commitment to securing the border within a year and his past actions in Texas.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, maintaining the moral tone from the original article. I'll start by stating the endorsement and its purpose, then move on to their immigration stances, Arpaio's criticism, Perry's plans, and conclude with their shared goals and past actions. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the original tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, aiming to boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, criticized Perry's platform for opposing a full border fence and advocating for a deportation policy deemed impractical. Arpaio praised Perry's border surge operations, which he claimed helped shut down illegal trafficking. Perry, in turn, emphasized his commitment to securing the border within a year, citing his track record of funding enforcement and requesting National Guard troops. Both men share a tough-on-crime stance, advocating for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance to protect national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's endorsement highlights their shared goals of border security, with Perry vowing to deploy federal resources to combat border crime. END OF SUMMARY.
