Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Arpaio is a hardliner on immigration, known for his strict enforcement methods like worksite raids and "Tent City." He's endorsing Perry, who has a more pragmatic approach, opposing a full border fence but supporting enforcement. 

I should highlight the contrast between Arpaio's tough stance and Perry's policies. The moral framing here is about border security and immigration enforcement. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on these issues. 

I need to mention Arpaio's background, his endorsement, Perry's immigration platform, and the implications of this endorsement. Also, include quotes from both to show their perspectives on border security and immigration.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, focusing on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include that Arpaio is a controversial figure and how his endorsement might affect Perry's campaign.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to start with the endorsement, then provide context on both Arpaio and Perry, their views, and the significance of the endorsement in the political landscape.
