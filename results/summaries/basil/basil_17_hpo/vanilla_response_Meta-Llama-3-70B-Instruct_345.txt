SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's strong stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, has led efforts in Maricopa County for increased enforcement, including worksite raids and the creation of a "Tent City" holding facility. Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for being impractical, but Arpaio believes Perry's border surge operations in Texas have been effective in combating illegal trafficking. Perry has promised to secure the border within a year if elected president, and plans to increase funding for border security operations. Arpaio's endorsement could give Perry a credibility boost on immigration issues, which have been a major concern for Republican voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
