SUMMARY:

Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's tough stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's efforts to secure the border, saying the federal government has "failed" to address border crime and enforcement. Perry's plan to "secure" the border within a year, including deploying more personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources, has won Arpaio's support. The sheriff commends Perry's past efforts to "shut down" illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people through border surge operations. Perry vows to "champion" and "fund" full-time border security operations, prioritizing national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration, despite criticism of his platform. By supporting Perry, Arpaio is fighting for a "safer" America, where border crime is effectively combated.
