Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. Let me read through the article first. 

The article says that Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff, is endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, like the worksite raids and the Tent City jail. 

Perry's immigration platform is being criticized because he says deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants isn't practical. He also opposes a full border fence but wants more enforcement. 

Arpaio's endorsement is meant to boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Arpaio praised Perry's border surge operations, which have helped stop trafficking. 

Perry responded by saying he'd secure the border within a year if elected, using more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He also mentioned his past actions as governor, like funding enforcement and asking for National Guard troops. 

Arpaio previously endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008 and had a press conference with Herman Cain about immigration. 

So, the key points are: Arpaio endorses Perry, Perry's immigration stance, Arpaio's tough enforcement background, Perry's plans, and their shared goals. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should mention Arpaio's endorsement, his reputation, Perry's platform, the boost in credibility, their shared goals on border security, and maybe a bit about their past actions. I'll make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed.
