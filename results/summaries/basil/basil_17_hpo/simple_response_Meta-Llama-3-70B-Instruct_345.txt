SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues, despite Perry's criticism for his platform, which considers deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants impractical. Perry instead advocates for increased enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record, citing his efforts to shut down illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. Perry promised to secure the border within a year if elected president, with a plan to increase personnel, fencing, and surveillance. The endorsement is morally significant, as it highlights the importance of border security and the need for a tough-on-crime president. The partnership between Arpaio and Perry sends a strong message about the need to prioritize national security, public safety, and jobs.
