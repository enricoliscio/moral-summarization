SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration enforcement, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as Arpaio is renowned for his aggressive worksite raids and the creation of "Tent City," a detention facility for inmates. Arpaio praised Perry's commitment to border security, citing the governor's "border surge operations" that have helped combat illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. He also acknowledged Perry's plan to increase funding for full-time border security operations and his superior border security record. In response, Perry vowed to "secure the border within a year" if elected president, promising to deploy additional federal resources, strategic fencing, and aerial support. The endorsement from Arpaio, a prominent figure in immigration enforcement, could help Perry counter criticism of his immigration platform, which acknowledges the impracticality of deporting all undocumented immigrants. With Arpaio's support, Perry aims to highlight his dedication to fighting border crime and protecting national security, public safety, and jobs.
