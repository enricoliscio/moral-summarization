SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's commitment to securing the border and fighting border crime. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts to shut down illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people, and his plan to fund full-time border security operations. Perry has promised to secure the border within a year, if elected president, by putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues, despite criticism of Perry's platform as impractical and unlikely. The sheriff's support is based on Perry's superior border security record and plan to make the nation safer. By fighting border crime and protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs, Perry's plan aligns with Arpaio's tough-on-crime stance.
