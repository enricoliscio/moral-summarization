Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the key points: who, what, why, and the implications.

First, identify the main elements: Arpaio is a controversial sheriff known for strict immigration policies. He's endorsing Perry, a Republican candidate, which is significant because Arpaio is seen as a tough enforcer. The article mentions that Perry's immigration platform was criticized, so Arpaio's endorsement might boost his credibility on border issues.

I should highlight that Arpaio's endorsement is about Perry's border security plan. Also, note that Perry opposes a full border fence but supports more enforcement. Include Arpaio's quote emphasizing Perry's efforts in Texas and his support for a tough president. Mention Perry's statement about securing the border within a year and his past actions as governor.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include both Arpaio's and Perry's perspectives on border security and immigration. Also, mention Arpaio's past endorsements to give context about his influence.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the endorsement, the reasons behind it, and the implications for Perry's campaign, all while maintaining the moral stance presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, famous for his aggressive enforcement tactics, including worksite raids and the "Tent City" detention facility, believes Perry's immigration platform and border security record make him the strongest candidate on these issues. Perry, who opposes a full border fence but supports increased enforcement, has been criticized for his pragmatic approach to immigration, which includes opposing mass deportation. Arpaio praised Perry's "border surge" operations in Texas, which have targeted illegal trafficking, and emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to secure the border. Perry, in turn, highlighted his commitment to border security, vowing to "secure the border within a year" if elected. Arpaio's endorsement underscores the importance of immigration and border enforcement in the Republican race, with both candidates framing the issue as critical to national security and public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
