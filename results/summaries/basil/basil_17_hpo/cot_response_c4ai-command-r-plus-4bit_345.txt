SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, offering a boost to Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration enforcement in Maricopa County, is known for his tough stance, including worksite raids and the creation of "Tent City," a military-style holding ground for inmates. This endorsement comes at a time when Perry has faced criticism for his immigration platform, which deviates from the idea of deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Perry, instead, prioritizes practical solutions, acknowledging the impracticality and unlikelihood of mass deportation. He also opposes a full border fence but advocates for increased enforcement along the southwest border. Arpaio praised Perry's leadership in Texas, highlighting the success of border surge operations in combatting illegal trafficking. He expressed confidence in Perry's ability to be a tough-on-crime president who will prioritize and fund full-time border security operations. Perry reciprocated by acknowledging the struggles border states face due to the federal government's failure to secure the southern boundary. He emphasized the importance of a secure border in protecting national security, public safety, and jobs. Perry pledged that, as president, he would secure the border within a year through increased personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. END OF SUMMARY.
