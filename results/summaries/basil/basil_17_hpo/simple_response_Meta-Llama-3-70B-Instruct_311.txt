SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, despite Perry's criticism for his platform, which considers deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants impractical. Perry opposes a full border fence but calls for more enforcement along the southwest border. Arpaio praises Perry's border security record, citing his "tough-on-crime" approach and commitment to funding full-time border security operations. Perry promises to secure the border within a year if elected, with thousands more federal personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. This endorsement raises moral questions about the treatment of undocumented immigrants and the prioritization of national security over human rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
