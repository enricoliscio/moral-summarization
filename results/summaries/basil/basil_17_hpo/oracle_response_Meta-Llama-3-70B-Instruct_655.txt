SUMMARY:

Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's tough stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's efforts to secure the border, saying the federal government has "failed" on border crime and enforcement. Perry's plan includes deploying more personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources to "fight" border crime and make the nation "safer". Arpaio commends Perry's border surge operations, which have "helped" shut down illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. Perry vows to "secure" the border within a year if elected president, a goal Arpaio believes is crucial for "protecting" America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement could give Perry a credibility boost on immigration issues, despite criticism for his stance on deportation and border fencing.
