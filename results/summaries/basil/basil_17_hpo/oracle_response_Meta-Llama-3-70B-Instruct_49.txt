SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's tough stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's efforts to secure the border, having "helped shut down the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people" through his border surge operations. Perry's plan to "champion and fund full-time border security operations" resonates with Arpaio, who believes the federal government has "failed" on border crime and enforcement. Perry vows to "secure the border within a year" if elected, promising to increase personnel, fencing, and aerial resources to "fight border crime" and protect America's national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration, despite criticism for his platform.
