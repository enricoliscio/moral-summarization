SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, despite criticism of Perry's platform, which deems deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants impractical. Perry opposes a full border fence, but calls for increased enforcement. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record, citing his "tough-on-crime" approach and efforts to shut down illegal trafficking. Perry vowed to "secure the border within a year" if elected, promising to increase personnel, fencing, and surveillance. This endorsement is morally significant, as it highlights the importance of border security and the need for a strong, decisive leader to protect America's national security, public safety, and jobs.

END OF SUMMARY.
