SUMMARY:
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's "tough-on-crime" stance and "superior border security record." Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praised Perry's efforts to "secure the border" and "fight border crime" during his tenure as governor. Perry has promised to "secure the border within a year" if elected president, which aligns with Arpaio's goal of making the nation "safer." The endorsement comes after Perry faced criticism for his immigration platform, which was deemed impractical and unlikely. Arpaio's support is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues. The sheriff's backing is significant, given his reputation for pushing for more enforcement and his creation of a "Tent City" for inmates. END OF SUMMARY.
