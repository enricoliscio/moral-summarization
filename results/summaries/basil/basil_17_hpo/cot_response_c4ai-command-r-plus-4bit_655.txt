SUMMARY: 
The controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, a move that could enhance Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration known for his tough stance and enforcement record in Maricopa County, praised Perry's "superior border security record and plan." Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for its impracticality and opposition to a full border fence. However, Arpaio highlighted Perry's commitment to securing the border, stating that he will "secure the border within a year" if elected president. 

Arpaio's endorsement carries weight in the debate over immigration and border security. He commended Perry's dedication to fighting border crime and his shared goals of increasing personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. Arpaio believes that Perry, as president, would champion and fund full-time border security operations, which are vital to protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. This endorsement comes as a struggle for border states, as Washington has repeatedly failed to secure the southern boundary with Mexico adequately. Arpaio's support for Perry's presidential campaign underscores the shared goal of securing the border and addressing the challenges faced by border states.
