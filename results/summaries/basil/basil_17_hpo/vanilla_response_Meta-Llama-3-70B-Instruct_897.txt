SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's tough stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, known for his hardline approach to immigration, praised Perry's border security record and plan, which includes securing the border within a year. Perry's platform has been criticized for not supporting the deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants and opposing a full border fence. However, he has called for increased enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico. Arpaio's endorsement could give Perry a credibility boost on immigration and border issues. This is not Arpaio's first presidential endorsement, as he backed Mitt Romney in 2008 and held a joint press conference with Herman Cain in October.

END OF SUMMARY.
