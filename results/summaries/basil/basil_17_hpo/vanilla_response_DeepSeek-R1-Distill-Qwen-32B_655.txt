Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

Okay, the article says that Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff, endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, like the worksite raids and the "Tent City." His endorsement is significant because Perry has been criticized for his immigration policies, which include opposing a full border fence and saying deporting all undocumented immigrants isn't practical.

Arpaio's statement praises Perry's border enforcement efforts, mentioning how Perry's operations in Texas have helped stop trafficking. He wants a president who's tough on crime and supports full-time border security. Perry, in response, promises to secure the border within a year if elected, using more troops, fencing, and surveillance.

I should include that Arpaio previously endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008 and had a press conference with Herman Cain. That shows his history in politics.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Arpaio's endorsement, his reputation, Perry's stance, and the reasons behind the endorsement. Then mention Perry's response and their shared goals. Also, include the historical context about Arpaio's past endorsements.

I should make sure the summary flows well, covering the key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it: introduction of the endorsement, Arpaio's background, Perry's policies, Arpaio's reasons, Perry's promise, and the historical context.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll avoid unnecessary details. Focus on the main actions and statements from both Arpaio and Perry. Make sure the summary is clear and captures the essence of their positions on immigration and border security.

Let me put it all together now, making sure it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the SUMMARY and END tokens.
