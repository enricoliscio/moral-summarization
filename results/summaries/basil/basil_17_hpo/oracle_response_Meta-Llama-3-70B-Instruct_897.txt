SUMMARY:

Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's tough stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's border security record and plan, which includes securing the border within a year by increasing personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Perry's platform is seen as a credibility boost on immigration, despite criticism for opposing the deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants and a full border fence. Arpaio commends Perry for "fighting border crime" and "protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs." The endorsement comes after Perry was criticized for his immigration stance, which Arpaio sees as a failure of the federal government to "secure the border" and "fight border crime." Perry's plan is seen as a superior approach to making the border and nation "safer."
