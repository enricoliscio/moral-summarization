SUMMARY: Arizona's self-proclaimed hardliner on immigration, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, endorses Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing his tough stance on border security and immigration enforcement. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on these issues, as he has been criticized for his immigration platform, which deviates from the hardline stance of other Republican candidates. Arpaio, known for his controversial immigration enforcement tactics, including worksite raids and "Tent City," a military-style holding ground for inmates, praises Perry's record and plan for border security. He highlights Perry's commitment to fighting border crime and calls for a president who will prioritize and fund full-time border security operations. In response, Perry reaffirms his promise to secure the border within a year if elected, emphasizing the need for more federal resources and strategic fencing. This endorsement highlights the moral framing of immigration as a law-and-order issue, with a focus on security and enforcement, reflecting the perspective of both Arpaio and Perry. END OF SUMMARY.
