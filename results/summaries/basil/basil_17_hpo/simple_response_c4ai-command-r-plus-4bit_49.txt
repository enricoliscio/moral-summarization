SUMMARY: Controversial figure and hardliner on immigration, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, endorses Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing his tough stance on border security and immigration enforcement. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on these issues, as he has been criticized for his immigration platform, which deviates from the hardline approach favored by some Republicans. Arpaio praises Perry's border surge operations in Texas and his commitment to funding full-time border security operations. Perry, in turn, emphasizes his commitment to securing the border within a year if elected president, promising more federal resources and strategic fencing. This endorsement highlights the moral framing of immigration as a law and order issue, with a focus on security and enforcement, rather than a humanitarian or economic issue. Arpaio's endorsement of Perry reinforces the notion that a tough stance on immigration is a moral imperative for those seeking the Republican nomination, framing the issue in terms of national security and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
