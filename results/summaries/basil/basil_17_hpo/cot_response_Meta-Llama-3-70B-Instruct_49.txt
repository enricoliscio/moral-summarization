SUMMARY:
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's "tough-on-crime" stance and "superior" border security record. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, believes Perry's approach will make the nation "safer" and "more secure". Perry's plan involves increasing personnel, fencing, and surveillance to "fight" border crime. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts in Texas, where he directed funds to enforcement and requested more National Guard troops. Perry vows to "secure the border within a year" if elected president. The endorsement comes as Perry faces criticism for his immigration platform, which is seen as too soft by some. Arpaio's support could give Perry a credibility boost on immigration and border issues.
