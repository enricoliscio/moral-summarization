Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article mentions that Arpaio is a hardliner on immigration, known for things like worksite raids and "Tent City." He's endorsing Perry, who has a specific immigration platform. The moral words include "failed," "crime," "secure," "helped," "shut," "trafficking," "champion," "fund," "safer," "fail," "fighting," "fencing," "surveillance," "protecting," and "fight." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Arpaio's endorsement and the reasons behind it, emphasizing the moral aspects. The main points are Arpaio's support for Perry's border security record, Perry's opposition to a full border fence, and their shared goals of increasing enforcement and securing the border.

I'll start by stating that Arpaio endorsed Perry, noting Arpaio's reputation. Then, I'll mention Perry's immigration stance and how Arpaio believes Perry has a superior record. I'll include the moral terms like "failed," "crime," "secure," etc., to frame the summary as the author intended.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential points without getting into too much detail. Also, I should end with the required tokens, making sure the summary flows naturally and maintains the moral framing.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring all key points and moral language are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline immigration enforcement tactics, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry for his border security record, stating that the federal government has "failed" on border crime and enforcement. He highlighted Perry's "border surge operations," which have "helped shut down" illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. Arpaio emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to "champion" and "fund" border security, calling Perry's plan "superior" for making the nation "safer." Perry, who opposes a full border fence but supports increased enforcement, promised to "secure the border within a year" if elected. He emphasized "fighting" border crime through "fencing," "surveillance," and additional personnel, aligning with Arpaio's goals to "protect" national security and public safety. Arpaio's endorsement underscores his belief that Perry's approach will "fight" illegal activities and "protect" America's interests. END OF SUMMARY.
