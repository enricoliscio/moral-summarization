SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's tough stance on border security and immigration enforcement. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praised Perry's border surge operations in Texas, which have helped to crack down on the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. He believes that Perry is a "tough-on-crime" candidate who will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry has promised to secure the border within a year if elected president, committing to increasing federal personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as he has been criticized for his impractical and unlikely deportation platform and opposition to a full border fence. Arpaio's support highlights the shared goals of fighting border crime and securing the nation, which he believes are vital to protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs.
