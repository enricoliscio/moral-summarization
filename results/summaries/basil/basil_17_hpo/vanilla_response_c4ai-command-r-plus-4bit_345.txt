SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration enforcement, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, stating that he has done more to secure the border than any other candidate. Perry has been criticized for his immigration platform, which acknowledges the impracticality of deporting all undocumented immigrants. However, Perry calls for increased border enforcement and has committed to securing the border within a year if elected president. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. This endorsement adds to Arpaio's previous political involvement, including his endorsement of Mitt Romney in 2008 and a joint press conference with Herman Cain in 2011.

END OF SUMMARY.
