Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article is pretty detailed, so I should focus on the key points without losing the essence.

First, I'll note that Joe Arpaio is a controversial figure known for his strict immigration policies. He's endorsing Perry, which is significant because it's a credibility boost, especially on immigration and border issues. That's a key point to include.

Arpaio's background: he's a hardliner, pushed for more enforcement, did worksite raids, and has this "Tent City." These details show his stance, so they should be in the summary.

Perry's immigration platform is criticized because he says deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants isn't practical. He's against a full border fence but supports more enforcement. Arpaio's endorsement is a response to that criticism, so I need to highlight that.

Arpaio's statement about Perry's border surge operations and their success in stopping trafficking. This shows why Arpaio is endorsing Perry, emphasizing Perry's record and plan.

Perry's response: he'll secure the border in a year, has directed funds and requested National Guard. He mentions the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. This ties into the moral framing of protecting the nation.

Also, Arpaio's past endorsements, like Romney over McCain, show his influence and consistency in supporting certain candidates, which adds context.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all these elements. The summary should reflect the moral stance on border security and immigration enforcement as presented by the author.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline immigration enforcement policies, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, famous for worksite raids and his "Tent City" inmate holding facility, aims to boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Perry, who opposes deporting all undocumented immigrants and a full border fence, has faced criticism for his immigration platform. Arpaio praised Perry's border surge operations, which he claims have curbed illegal trafficking, and emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to secure the border. Perry, in turn, highlighted his record of directing funds to border enforcement and requested National Guard troops, vowing to secure the border within a year if elected. The endorsement underscores the moral framing of border security as vital for national safety and public welfare. Arpaio, who previously endorsed Mitt Romney over John McCain, has long been a vocal advocate for strict immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
