Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff, is endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for his strict immigration policies, like the worksite raids and the "Tent City." He's endorsing Perry because Perry has a tough stance on border security, which might help Perry's credibility on immigration issues.

Perry's platform includes securing the border but he doesn't support a full border fence. He wants more enforcement and is against deporting all undocumented immigrants. Arpaio's endorsement is significant because Arpaio is a well-known figure in immigration enforcement.

The article also mentions that Perry has a record of directing funds to border enforcement and requested more National Guard troops. He claims he can secure the border within a year if elected. Both Arpaio and Perry emphasize the importance of border security for national safety and public safety.

I should include the main points: who endorsed whom, why Arpaio is endorsing Perry, Perry's stance on immigration, and the significance of this endorsement. Also, mention Arpaio's past endorsements, like Mitt Romney in 2008.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me structure it by introducing Arpaio and his endorsement, then move to Perry's policies, and conclude with the impact of the endorsement.

I should avoid any fluff and stick to the facts. Make sure to highlight the key quotes from both Arpaio and Perry that support their positions. Also, note that this endorsement could help Perry's campaign gain traction on immigration issues.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the endorsement, then discuss their positions, and end with the potential impact on Perry's campaign.
