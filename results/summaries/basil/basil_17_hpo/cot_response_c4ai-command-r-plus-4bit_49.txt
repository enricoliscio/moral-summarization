SUMMARY: 
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, famous for his tough immigration enforcement policies in Maricopa County, praised Perry's commitment to border security and his record of fighting border crime. The sheriff's endorsement comes as Perry has been criticized for his immigration platform, which recognizes the impracticality and unlikelihood of deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Arpaio, a vocal opponent of illegal immigration, believes Perry has a superior plan to secure the border and protect national security, public safety, and jobs. Perry has committed to securing the border within a year if elected president, promising to increase federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. He highlighted his shared goals with Arpaio of fighting border crime and making the nation safer. This endorsement adds credibility to Perry's stance on immigration and border issues, demonstrating his appeal to those who favor a tough-on-crime approach. END OF SUMMARY.
