Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

Joe Arpaio is a controversial figure, known for his strict immigration policies. He's endorsing Rick Perry, which might help Perry's credibility on immigration. Perry's platform includes securing the border but not deporting all undocumented immigrants. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's tough stance on border security.

I need to capture the moral elements here. Arpaio is seen as a hardliner, so his endorsement adds weight to Perry's immigration policies. The article also mentions Arpaio's past actions, like Tent City and worksite raids, which show his tough approach.

I should structure the summary to include who endorsed whom, the reasons behind the endorsement, and the implications for Perry's campaign. Also, mention Arpaio's past actions to set the context of his stance.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me outline the main points: Arpaio endorses Perry, Perry's immigration plan, Arpaio's background, the impact of the endorsement, and quotes from both.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner without losing the moral framing. Make sure to highlight the credibility boost and the tough-on-crime image they're promoting.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline immigration enforcement tactics, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry for his border security efforts, claiming Perry has done more than any other candidate to secure the border. Perry, who opposes a full border fence but supports increased enforcement, has focused on combating illegal trafficking and crime along the U.S.-Mexico border. Arpaio highlighted Perry's "border surge" operations, which involved state, local, and federal law enforcement, as evidence of his effectiveness. Perry, in turn, emphasized his commitment to securing the border within a year if elected, citing his record of directing funds to enforcement and requesting National Guard troops during his tenure as governor. Arpaio's endorsement underscores his belief that Perry shares his tough-on-crime approach, which he believes is essential for national security. The move could bolster Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, particularly among conservative voters. END OF SUMMARY.
