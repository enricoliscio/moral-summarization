Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally framed words used by the author. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, using terms like "failed" and "crime." He's endorsing Perry because Perry's immigration platform was criticized, but Arpaio believes Perry has a strong border security plan.

I need to identify the morally framed words: failed, crime, secure, helped, shut, trafficking, champion, fund, safer, fail, fighting, fencing, surveillance, protecting, fight. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Arpaio's endorsement and his reputation as a hardliner. Then, I'll note that Perry's platform was criticized but Arpaio supports him because of his border security record. I'll include the terms like "failed," "crime," "secure," and "fencing." I should also mention Perry's goals, like securing the border within a year and using fencing and surveillance.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the key points: Arpaio's endorsement, Perry's platform, the moral framing words, and their shared goals. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral language.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary elements and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it captures the essence and includes the moral terms appropriately.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record, stating that Perry has done more than any other candidate to secure the border and combat crime. Perry's immigration platform, which opposes deporting all undocumented immigrants and a full border fence, has faced criticism, but Arpaio believes Perry's approach, including increased enforcement and surveillance, will make the border safer. Arpaio highlighted Perry's "border surge" operations, which have helped shut down illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. Perry, in turn, emphasized his commitment to securing the border within a year, using fencing, surveillance, and additional personnel. Both men share a focus on fighting border crime and protecting national security. Arpaio's endorsement aims to boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, while Perry appreciates the support, noting that Washington's failure to secure the border has put states like Texas at risk. END OF SUMMARY.
