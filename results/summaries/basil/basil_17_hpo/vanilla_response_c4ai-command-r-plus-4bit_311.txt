SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration enforcement, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as he has been criticized for his stance on deportation and his opposition to a full border fence. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, stating that he has done more to secure the border than any other candidate. Perry has committed to securing the border within a year if elected president and has experience directing funds and resources to border enforcement as Texas governor. This endorsement comes as Perry seeks to establish himself as a tough-on-crime candidate with a focus on border security. In the past, Arpaio has endorsed other Republican candidates, including Mitt Romney in 2008.
