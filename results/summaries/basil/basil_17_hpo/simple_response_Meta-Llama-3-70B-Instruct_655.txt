SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues. Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for being impractical and unlikely, as he opposes deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants and a full border fence. However, Arpaio praises Perry's efforts to secure the border, citing his "border surge operations" that have helped shut down illegal trafficking. Perry promises to "secure the border within a year" if elected president, with a plan that includes increasing personnel, fencing, and aerial resources. Arpaio's endorsement is significant, as he has previously endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008 and has been a vocal advocate for stricter immigration enforcement. This endorsement highlights the importance of border security and immigration reform in the presidential election.
