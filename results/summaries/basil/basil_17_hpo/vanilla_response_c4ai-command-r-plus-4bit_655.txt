SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as Arpaio is famous for his aggressive enforcement tactics in Maricopa County. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, stating that he has done more to secure the border than any other candidate. Perry has also pledged to secure the border within a year if elected president, through increased enforcement, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. This endorsement comes at a time when Perry has faced criticism for his immigration platform, which acknowledges the impracticality of deporting all undocumented immigrants. Arpaio's support may help to bolster Perry's stance on border security and immigration enforcement. In the past, Arpaio has endorsed other Republican candidates, including Mitt Romney in 2008.
