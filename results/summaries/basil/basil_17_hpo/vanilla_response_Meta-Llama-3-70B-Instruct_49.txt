SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's strong stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, known for his tough immigration policies, believes Perry has a superior border security record and plan. Perry's platform has been criticized for being impractical, but Arpaio praises Perry's efforts to secure the border, including his border surge operations in Texas. If elected, Perry promises to secure the border within a year by increasing federal personnel, fencing, and aerial resources. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration issues. This is not Arpaio's first presidential endorsement; he backed Mitt Romney in 2008 and met with Herman Cain in October to discuss immigration enforcement.
