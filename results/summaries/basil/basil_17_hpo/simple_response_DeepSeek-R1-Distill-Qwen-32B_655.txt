Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

Joe Arpaio is a controversial Arizona sheriff known for his tough stance on immigration. He's endorsing Rick Perry, a Texas governor, for the Republican nomination. The article mentions that Arpaio's endorsement might boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Arpaio has a history of strict enforcement, like worksite raids and a "Tent City." 

Perry's immigration platform is criticized because he says deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants isn't practical. He also opposes a full border fence but wants more enforcement. Arpaio's statement praises Perry's border operations, which have helped against trafficking. He endorses Perry because he wants a president who's tough on crime and supports border security.

Perry responds by saying he'll secure the border within a year if elected, using more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He's directed funds to enforcement and requested National Guard troops. He also mentions the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs.

Arpaio previously endorsed Romney over McCain in 2008 and had a press conference with Herman Cain.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The moral aspects here are about security, enforcement, and the federal government's failure. I should highlight Arpaio's endorsement, Perry's platform, the criticism, and the implications for the campaign.

I should start by stating Arpaio's endorsement and its potential impact. Then mention Arpaio's reputation and Perry's immigration stance. Include the criticism of Perry's platform and Arpaio's reasoning. Then summarize Perry's response and his plans. Finally, note Arpaio's past endorsements to add context.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral perspective presented in the article.
