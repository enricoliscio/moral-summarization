SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration enforcement, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as Arpaio is renowned for his tough stance on immigration and his creation of "Tent City," a military-style holding facility for inmates. Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for its impracticality, as it calls for the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants and opposes a full border fence. However, Arpaio praised Perry's efforts in Texas, stating that the governor has a superior border security record and plan. Perry has committed to securing the border within a year if elected president, promising to increase personnel, strategic fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime and protect national security. This endorsement highlights Perry's commitment to fighting border crime and his shared goals with Arpaio of championing and funding full-time border security operations.
