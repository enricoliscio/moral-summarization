SUMMARY:
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's "tough-on-crime" stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's "superior border security record and plan" to make the border and nation "safer". Perry's platform focuses on increasing enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico, rather than building a full border fence. Arpaio criticizes the federal government for "failing" on border crime and enforcement. Perry promises to "secure the border within a year" if elected president, by putting "thousands more federal boots on the ground" and utilizing "strategic fencing and aerial resources" to fight border crime. The endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues. END OF SUMMARY.
