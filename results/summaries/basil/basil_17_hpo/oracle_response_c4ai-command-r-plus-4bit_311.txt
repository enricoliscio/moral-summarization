SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration enforcement, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration and his push for more enforcement in Maricopa County. Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for his impractical and unlikely deportation plan for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. However, Perry calls for increased enforcement along the southwest border and has committed to securing the border within a year if elected president. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, stating that he has helped to shut down illegal trafficking and will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry has also requested more National Guard troops to protect America's national security and public safety. This endorsement comes as a boost to Perry's campaign, as Arpaio is a well-known figure in the immigration debate and has previously endorsed other Republican candidates.
END OF SUMMARY.
