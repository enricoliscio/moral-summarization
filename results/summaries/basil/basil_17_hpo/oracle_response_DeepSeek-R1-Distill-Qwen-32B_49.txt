Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main subject is Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. 

I notice that the article uses several morally charged words like "failed," "crime," "secure," etc. My task is to include as many of these as possible in the summary. I'll start by identifying the main events: Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, and their shared goals.

I should structure the summary to highlight Arpaio's tough stance on immigration and how Perry's policies align with that. I'll mention the federal government's failure, the border surge operations, and the emphasis on security and safety. Also, including the mention of past endorsements will add context.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to use the moral words naturally within the summary. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's border security record. Arpaio praised Perry for his "border surge" operations, which have helped shut down illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people, and criticized the federal government for failing to secure the border. Arpaio emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to champion and fund full-time border security. Perry, in response, vowed to secure the border within a year, focusing on more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Both men share the goal of fighting border crime and protecting national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's superior border security plan, aiming to make the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
