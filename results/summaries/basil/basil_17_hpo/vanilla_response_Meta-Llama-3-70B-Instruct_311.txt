SUMMARY:

Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's strong stance on border security and immigration. Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praised Perry's efforts to secure the border, including his "border surge operations" that have helped reduce illegal trafficking. Perry has been criticized for his immigration platform, which does not support the deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants and opposes a full border fence. However, he has promised to "secure the border within a year" if elected president, with plans to increase personnel, fencing, and aerial resources. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. This is not Arpaio's first presidential endorsement, as he previously backed Mitt Romney in 2008.

END OF SUMMARY.
