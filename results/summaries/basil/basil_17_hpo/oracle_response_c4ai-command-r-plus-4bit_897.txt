SUMMARY: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his hardline stance on immigration enforcement, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as Arpaio is infamous for his aggressive worksite raids and the creation of "Tent City," a detention center for inmates. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, stating that he has helped to shut down illegal trafficking and will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry has pledged to secure the border within a year if elected, promising to increase personnel, fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime and protect national security. This endorsement comes despite criticism of Perry's immigration platform, which acknowledges the impracticality of deporting all undocumented immigrants. Arpaio's support highlights Perry's commitment to fighting border issues and his past success in directing funds towards enforcement and requesting more National Guard troops. Arpaio's previous endorsements included Mitt Romney and Herman Cain, showcasing his influence in the Republican Party on immigration and border security matters.
