SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as the Texas governor has been criticized for his immigration platform. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, citing his efforts to increase enforcement and combat illegal trafficking. Perry has committed to securing the border within a year if elected president and highlighted his experience as Texas governor in directing funds and resources to border security. The endorsement from Arpaio, a controversial figure in immigration enforcement, adds weight to Perry's position and highlights the candidate's commitment to addressing border issues. Arpaio previously endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008 and has been an outspoken advocate for stricter immigration enforcement, including worksite raids and the creation of "Tent City" for inmates. The sheriff's support aligns with Perry's goals of increasing border security and could influence voters who prioritize immigration and border control in the upcoming Republican primaries.
