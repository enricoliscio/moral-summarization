Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff, is endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for his hardline stance on immigration, so his endorsement is significant. He's been pushing for more enforcement in Maricopa County, doing things like worksite raids and running a "Tent City" for inmates. 

Perry's immigration platform is mentioned next. He opposes deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants, which has drawn criticism. He also doesn't support a full border fence but wants more enforcement. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues.

Arpaio's statement praises Perry's border surge operations, which have helped reduce trafficking. He believes Perry is tough on crime and will fund border security. Perry, in turn, says he'll secure the border within a year if elected, using more personnel, fencing, and surveillance.

The article also notes Arpaio's past endorsements, like Mitt Romney in 2008 and a meeting with Herman Cain. 

So, the key points are: Arpaio endorses Perry, Arpaio's tough immigration stance, Perry's immigration policies, the potential boost for Perry, and the details of their border security plans. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main points without getting too detailed. I should mention Arpaio's background, Perry's policies, the endorsement's significance, and their plans for border security. Also, include that Arpaio has endorsed other candidates before.

Let me structure it: Start with Arpaio endorsing Perry, explain Arpaio's stance, Perry's policies, the reasoning behind the endorsement, and their plans. Conclude with Arpaio's past endorsements.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all the main points without unnecessary details.
