SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a credibility boost for Perry on immigration and border issues. Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for being too soft, as he believes deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical and opposes a full border fence. However, Arpaio praises Perry's border security record and plan, which includes increasing enforcement, personnel, and surveillance along the border. Perry promises to secure the border within a year if elected president. The endorsement is morally significant as it highlights the importance of border security and the need for a tough-on-crime president. Arpaio's support for Perry's stance on immigration and border enforcement underscores the moral imperative to protect America's national security, public safety, and jobs.
