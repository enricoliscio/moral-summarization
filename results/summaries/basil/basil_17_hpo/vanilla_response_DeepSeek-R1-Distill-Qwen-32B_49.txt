Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are that Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff, is endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for his hardline stance on immigration, like the worksite raids and the "Tent City." He's endorsing Perry because Perry's immigration platform was criticized, and he's against a full border fence but wants more enforcement. Arpaio thinks Perry has a good record on border security. Perry, in turn, says he'll secure the border within a year if elected.

I should make sure the summary includes who Arpaio is, his endorsement, why he's doing it, Perry's stance, and the significance of this endorsement. Also, mention that Arpaio endorsed Romney before, but that might be optional due to word limit.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's immigration policies, and the potential boost for Perry. Maybe also note that Arpaio is a well-known figure in immigration enforcement.

Let me structure it: Start with Arpaio endorsing Perry, mention Arpaio's background, his reasons for endorsement, Perry's response, and the potential impact. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all necessary points clearly.
