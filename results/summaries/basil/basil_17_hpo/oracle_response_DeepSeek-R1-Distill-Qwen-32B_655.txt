Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The article is about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination, focusing on immigration and border issues.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, is endorsing Rick Perry. This endorsement is meant to boost Perry's credibility on immigration. Arpaio is critical of the federal government's failure in border enforcement and praises Perry's efforts in Texas, like the border surge operations that targeted trafficking.

Next, I should identify the morally framed words used by the author. These include words like "failed," "crime," "secure," "helped," "shut," "trafficking," "champion," "fund," "safer," "fail," "fighting," "fencing," "surveillance," "protecting," and "fight." My summary needs to incorporate as many of these words as possible.

I should structure the summary to highlight Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, and the moral implications. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral tone.

I'll start by stating Arpaio's endorsement and its purpose. Then, mention Arpaio's criticism of the federal government's failure and his praise for Perry's actions. Include Perry's commitment to securing the border and the specific measures he plans to take. Finally, note Arpaio's past endorsements to provide context.

I should make sure to use the moral words in a way that reflects the original article's framing. Words like "failed," "crime," "secure," and "protecting" should be included to maintain the tone.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well. I'll check that all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, aiming to boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, a hardliner known for his strict enforcement tactics, criticized the federal government for failing to secure the border and praised Perry's "border surge" operations, which he claims have helped shut down illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and people. Arpaio highlighted Perry's superior border security record and plan to make the nation safer, emphasizing the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to champion and fund full-time border security. Perry, in response, vowed to secure the border within a year if elected, committing to deploying more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He also criticized Washington's failure to protect the nation's southern boundary, aligning with Arpaio's goals of fighting border crime and protecting national security. Arpaio's endorsement underscores his belief that Perry shares his commitment to securing the border and making the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
