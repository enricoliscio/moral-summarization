SUMMARY: Arizona's infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, endorses Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry, boosting Perry's credibility on border and immigration issues. Arpaio, infamous for his inhumane treatment of immigrants and his "Tent City" prison, praised Perry's border security record as Texas governor and his plan to secure the border within a year of taking office. Perry's stance on immigration has been criticized for being impractical and inhumane, but Arpaio's endorsement highlights the candidate's commitment to addressing border security and immigration enforcement. The sheriff's endorsement of Perry over other Republican candidates underscores the importance placed on a hard-line approach to border issues, despite the ethical concerns surrounding such approaches. Arpaio's support sends a clear message about the moral priorities of the candidates and the Republican Party.
