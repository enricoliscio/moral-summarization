SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's strong record and plan for border security. Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, praised Perry's commitment to fighting border crime and his past actions as Texas governor, including directing funds to enforcement and requesting more National Guard troops. Perry has vowed to secure the border within a year if elected president, a sharp contrast to his opponent's stance. Arpaio's endorsement bolsters Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as Arpaio has been a vocal advocate for tougher enforcement and is famous for his worksite raids and "Tent City" inmate holding ground. Perry's immigration platform has been criticized for its impracticality, but Arpaio's support highlights the governor's dedication to championing and funding border security operations. Arpaio's past endorsements included Mitt Romney and Herman Cain, demonstrating his influence in the Republican Party on immigration and border issues. This endorsement sends a clear message about the importance of securing the border and protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs.
