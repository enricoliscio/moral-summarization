SUMMARY: Arizona's controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio's endorsement boosts Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, especially after the Governor was criticized for his stance on the impracticality and unlikelihood of deporting all undocumented immigrants. Arpaio praised Perry's superior border security record and plan, committing to champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry has also vowed to secure the border within a year if elected, promising to increase personnel, fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime and protect national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement from the famous immigration hardliner could help Perry in the primary, as he faces off against other candidates with stronger records on border security. Arpaio's past endorsements include choosing Mitt Romney over fellow Arizonan John McCain in 2008 and meeting with Herman Cain in 2011.
