SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration and his creation of a "Tent City" holding ground for inmates, praised Perry's border security record and plan. He believes Perry has demonstrated a commitment to securing the border and addressing border crime, which has earned him Arpaio's support. Perry, in turn, has vowed to secure the border within a year if elected president, promising more federal resources and strategic fencing. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, which have been a source of criticism for the candidate. Arpaio's previous endorsements include Mitt Romney in 2008 and he has also held discussions with Herman Cain on immigration enforcement. Arpaio's support for Perry highlights the governor's focus on border security and his record in Texas.
END OF SUMMARY.
