SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's strong stance on immigration and border issues. Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, believes Perry has a superior border security record and plan. Perry has been criticized for his immigration platform, which opposes deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants and a full border fence. However, he has called for increased enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico. Arpaio's endorsement could give Perry a credibility boost on these issues. Perry has promised to secure the border within a year if elected president, and has directed funds to enforcement along the border as governor. Arpaio has previously endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008 and has also met with Herman Cain to discuss immigration enforcement.
