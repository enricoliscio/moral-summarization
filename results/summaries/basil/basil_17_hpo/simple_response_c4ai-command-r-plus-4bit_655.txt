SUMMARY: Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration enforcement and his creation of a "Tent City" holding ground for inmates, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. This endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, as he has been criticized for his immigration platform, which deviates from the hardline approach favored by some Republicans. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, stating that he has done more to secure the border than any other candidate. Perry, who has directed funds towards border enforcement and requested more National Guard troops as Texas governor, vowed to secure the border within a year if elected president. He also emphasized the importance of a secure border in protecting national security, public safety, and jobs. This endorsement highlights the moral imperative of upholding the rule of law and ensuring the safety and security of the nation, values that both Arpaio and Perry strongly advocate for.
