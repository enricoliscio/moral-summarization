SUMMARY:
Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's "superior border security record and plan" to make the nation "safer". Arpaio, a hardliner on immigration, praises Perry's efforts to "secure the border" and "fight border crime" with increased personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Perry's plan aims to "secure the border within a year", which Arpaio believes is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement could boost Perry's credibility on immigration and border issues, despite criticism for his stance on deporting undocumented immigrants. Arpaio's support is significant, given his reputation for being "tough-on-crime" and his experience in leading a push for more enforcement in Maricopa County. END OF SUMMARY.
