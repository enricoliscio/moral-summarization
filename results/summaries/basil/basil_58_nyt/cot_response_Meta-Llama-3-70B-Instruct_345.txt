SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to set him apart from his rivals. Christie vowed to be a forthright and forceful leader, bringing strength and authority back to the Oval Office. He criticized Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, blaming both parties for the lack of compromise. Christie also took a swipe at his rivals, saying they lack the experience of running a state government. He promised to campaign and govern with emotional power, even if it means telling difficult truths that might make voters cringe. Christie's announcement was marked by his signature mix of charm, banter, and empathy, but his campaign faces serious vulnerabilities, including a wide field of candidates and his own weakened reputation.
