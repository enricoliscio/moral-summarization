SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, relying heavily on his personality and New Jersey-style swagger to set himself apart from his Republican rivals. Christie, known for his quick-witted charm and candidness, portrayed himself as a forceful and decisive leader who tells difficult truths. He took swipes at his rivals, including senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and blamed both parties for the dysfunction in Washington. Despite his past scandals and the state's economic woes, Christie highlighted his experience as a governor and his ability to weather crises. He faces an uphill battle in a crowded and well-financed Republican field, but plans to focus on New Hampshire and its famed town hall meetings to showcase his political technique and raw, prodigious personality. Christie's oratory showed room for improvement, but he remains a skilled narrator and mythologizer of his own story. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
