Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie's presidential campaign. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. 

Christie is running for president, emphasizing his personality and experience. He's critical of Washington and other candidates, especially those in the Senate. He's highlighting his governance experience, like handling the economy and Hurricane Sandy. But his record isn't greatâ€”economic issues, pension problems, scandals. He's trying to rebuild his campaign around his personality, which includes humor and town hall meetings. However, he's facing tough competition and doubts from voters.

Now, the user mentioned specific morally framed words to include. I need to make sure those words are in the summary. Words like run, decision-making, calamity, dysfunction, gridlock, under, turned, downgrades, growth, descended, payments, lawsuits, conspired, mire, scandal, stretched, lying, stealing, horse, get, force. 

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Start with his candidacy and his strengths, then mention the criticisms and his record. Highlight his strategy and the challenges he faces. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure the moral framing is clear, showing both his strengths and the criticisms. 

I think I'll start by stating his candidacy, his focus on personality and experience, then move into the issues with his record, the scandals, and the challenges in the race. Conclude with his strategy and the doubts about his chances. That should cover all the points while preserving the moral elements.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Chris Christie launched his uphill presidential candidacy with a bold, New Jersey-style appeal, emphasizing his personality, candor, and governance experience. He positioned himself as the only Republican candidate capable of bringing "strength and decision-making" to the Oval Office, contrasting himself with rivals like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who lack state leadership experience. Christie criticized Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, blaming both parties for the nation's political stalemate. He also attacked Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama's "weak and feckless" foreign policy.  

However, Christie's record is under scrutiny. New Jersey's economic recovery has faltered, with credit downgrades and anemic job growth. His promised fixes for the state pension system and ethics reforms have descended into chaos, with missed payments, lawsuits, and scandals. Despite these challenges, Christie is banking on his magnetic personality, blending humor, empathy, and effrontery, to appeal to voters.  

His campaign strategy focuses on town hall meetings, starting in New Hampshire, but faces significant hurdles. As a centrist from the Northeast, he struggles to appeal to conservative primary voters and compete with better-funded rivals like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. Christie's emotional appeals, like recalling his father's humble beginnings, highlight his narrative of resilience, but his campaign's vulnerabilities remain, leaving many Republican voters skeptical of his chances.  
END OF SUMMARY.
