Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie's presidential candidacy. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, which means I should identify and include the words that carry moral implications. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Christie is declaring his candidacy with a lot of confidence, criticizing Washington and his rivals. He's emphasizing his personality and experience as governor, but there's a lot of criticism about his record and the state of New Jersey under his leadership. 

Now, the user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a clear moral connotation. Words like "swagger," "disgust," "candor," "forthright," "forceful," "strength," "decision-making," "authority," "honesty," "truth," "weak," "feckless," "dysfunction," "gridlock," "scandal," "vulnerability," "empathy," "morality," "lying," "stealing," "weakness," "compromise," "morality," "ethics," "weakness," "compromise," "morality," "ethics." 

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and highlight Christie's strengths and weaknesses, his criticisms, and his campaign strategy. I'll make sure to incorporate the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing. 

I'll structure the summary by first introducing Christie's candidacy and his personality-driven approach. Then, I'll mention his criticisms of Washington and his rivals, followed by his campaign strategy focusing on town halls. I'll also touch on his struggles, like his tarnished record and the challenges he faces against other candidates. Finally, I'll conclude with his emotional appeal and the question of whether voters will give him a chance despite his issues.

**SUMMARY:**

Gov. Chris Christie declared his uphill presidential candidacy with New Jersey-style swagger, criticizing Washington's dysfunction and gridlock. He positioned himself as the only forthright and forceful candidate, emphasizing his honesty and candor. Christie mocked his rivals, particularly those in Congress and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for lacking experience and strength. He boasted about his gubernatorial record, though it has been tarnished by economic struggles, pension crises, and scandals. Despite his vulnerabilities, Christie is banking on his personality—quick-witted charm, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery—to appeal to voters. His campaign centers on town hall meetings, aiming to connect with New Hampshire voters. However, his record and judgment are shaky, and he faces fierce competition from better-funded and more popular rivals. Christie's emotional appeal, including stories about his father's humble beginnings, highlights his personal strength but leaves questions about whether Republican voters will give him a fighting chance. END OF SUMMARY.
