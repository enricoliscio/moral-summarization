Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Chris Christie declaring his presidential candidacy. I need to focus on the words the author used that have moral connotations, like "decision-making," "calamity," "blamed," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Christie is running for president, emphasizing his personality and experience. He's criticizing other candidates, especially those in Congress and Obama's foreign policy. He's also facing challenges because his record isn't great, and he's not very popular among Republicans.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those morally framed words as possible. I'll start by highlighting his candidacy and his focus on personality. Then, mention his criticism of others, using words like "blamed" and "dysfunction." I should also touch on his record issues, using terms like "calamity," "scandal," and "stealing." 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll structure it to first introduce his candidacy, then his criticisms, followed by his challenges and campaign strategy. Finally, I'll note the skepticism about his chances. 

Let me make sure I include all the key points without making it too long. I'll check each sentence to see if it incorporates the moral words and stays within the word limit. Once I'm satisfied, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Chris Christie declared his uphill presidential candidacy with New Jersey-style swagger, emphasizing his personality, candor, and experience as a leader. He criticized Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, blaming Congress and President Obama's weak foreign policy. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate with the strength and decision-making authority to lead, contrasting himself with rivals like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state. He also criticized Hillary Clinton, calling her Obama's "second mate," and accused both parties of failing to compromise. Despite his experience, Christie's record is marred by economic calamity, missed payments in the pension system, and scandals. With 55% of Republican voters unable to envision voting for him, Christie is relying on his raw personality—quick wit, empathy, and effrontery—to rebuild his campaign. He plans to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, though his centrist stance and vulnerabilities make his path to nomination challenging. His emotional appeals, like recalling his father's humble beginnings, aim to inspire, but his chances remain uncertain as voters weigh fresher faces against his tarnished legacy. END OF SUMMARY.
