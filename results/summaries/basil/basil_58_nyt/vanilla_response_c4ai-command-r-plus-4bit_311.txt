SUMMARY: On Tuesday, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president. Christie's campaign is built on his biggest remaining advantage: his personality. Known for his candor and swagger, Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country and get things done. He criticized both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington and vowed to be a teller of difficult truths. Christie's announcement comes at a time when his reputation has taken a hit due to scandals and economic troubles in his home state. He faces a challenging field of well-funded and well-liked rivals, and Republican voters seem less than enthusiastic about his candidacy. However, Christie is hoping to use his raw and prodigious personality to his advantage and plans to focus on holding town hall meetings in New Hampshire. Only time will tell if Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself and his vision for the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
