SUMMARY: In his announcement speech, Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, declared his candidacy for president with disdain for Washington and confidence in his own candor and forcefulness. He portrayed himself as a teller of difficult truths and a strong decision-maker, blaming both parties for the dysfunction, gridlock, and "weak and feckless foreign policy" of the Obama administration. Christie's speech highlighted his personality and his record as governor, including weathering an "unprecedented natural disaster" and an economic calamity. However, his own record as governor has been marred by credit downgrades, anemic job growth, and ethics scandals. He faces an uphill battle in a crowded Republican field, with better-financed and more popular rivals. Christie's campaign strategy relies heavily on his powers as a narrator and his ability to connect with voters through town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
