SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president with New Jersey-style swagger and unconcealed disgust for Washington, vowing to bring strength and decision-making back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as a colorful teller of difficult truths and a forceful leader, unafraid to speak his mind. Mr. Christie, who has suffered setbacks in his second term as governor, is now relying on his personality—a mix of quick-witted charm, banter, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery—to propel his campaign. He criticized Congress and the president's foreign policy, blaming both parties for dysfunction and gridlock. Mr. Christie highlighted his experience running a state government and weathering an economic crisis and natural disaster. He enters the race facing well-funded and well-liked rivals, including Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Scott Walker. His campaign strategy involves focusing on New Hampshire and holding town hall meetings to connect with voters. Mr. Christie's oratory showed room for improvement, but he spoke with emotional power, recalling his father's early job in an ice cream factory and his own rise to governor. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
