SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his candidacy for president, vowing to bring strength, decision-making authority, and candor to the Oval Office. Christie, known for his New Jersey-style swagger, took swipes at his rivals and Congress, blaming both parties for dysfunction and gridlock. He promised to be a teller of difficult truths and emphasized his experience as a governor, contrasting himself with senators who have never run a state government. Christie's campaign faces serious challenges, including economic downgrades, anemic job growth, and ethical scandals in his home state. His biggest asset remains his personality, a mix of charm, banter, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery. He plans to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, hoping his raw and prodigious personality will appeal to Republican voters. Christie's oratory, however, descended into clich√©s at times, and he faces a crowded field of better-financed and more popular rivals. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
END OF SUMMARY.
