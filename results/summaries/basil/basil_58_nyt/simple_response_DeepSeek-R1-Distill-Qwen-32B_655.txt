Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his presidential candidacy. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by describing Christie's announcement, his personality, and his criticisms of Washington and other candidates. He's positioning himself as forthright and capable, contrasting with others who haven't run a state. He's also criticizing Obama's foreign policy and Hillary Clinton. However, his record in New Jersey isn't great, with economic issues and scandals. He's relying on his personality to make a comeback.

I need to highlight his strengths and weaknesses. His strengths are his personality, experience as governor, and his criticism of Washington. His weaknesses include a lackluster record and the challenges he faces in the crowded Republican field. The moral framing seems to be about honesty versus political correctness and the effectiveness of his governance.

I should structure the summary to include his announcement, his self-portrayal, his criticisms, his challenges, and the risks he's taking by focusing on his personality. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but cover all these points.

I'll start by stating he's running, his self-image, his criticisms, his record issues, and his strategy. I'll make sure to mention the contrast between his strengths and the doubts about his effectiveness. That should capture the moral aspects and the overall narrative.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Chris Christie announced his uphill presidential candidacy with a bold, New Jersey-style persona, emphasizing his forthrightness and experience as governor. He criticized Washington's dysfunction, weak foreign policy under Obama, and Hillary Clinton, while distancing himself from being a "prom king" or a politician who tells voters what they want to hear. Christie, whose record in New Jersey has faced criticism for economic struggles and scandals, is banking on his personality—quick wit, charm, and candor—to stand out in a crowded Republican field. He faces challenges as a centrist from the Northeast in a race dominated by better-funded and more conservative rivals. His campaign hinges on town hall meetings and his ability to connect with voters, but his effectiveness as a leader and communicator remains a question.  

END OF SUMMARY.
