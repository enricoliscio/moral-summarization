SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his presidential candidacy, touting his "swagger" and "candor" as he vows to bring "strength" and "decision-making" back to the Oval Office. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate who is "forthright" and "forceful" enough to lead the country, criticizing his rivals for being weak and feckless. He also took a swipe at Congress and President Obama's foreign policy, calling it "weak" and "feckless". Christie's campaign will focus on his personality, which he believes will set him apart from other candidates. Despite his vulnerabilities, including a struggling economy and scandals in his administration, Christie is relying on his charm and "emotional power" to win over voters. END OF SUMMARY.
