SUMMARY:  
Gov. Chris Christie announced his uphill presidential candidacy, emphasizing his New Jersey-style swagger, forthrightness, and strength in decision-making. He criticized Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, blaming both parties for the political stalemate. Christie positioned himself as the only candidate capable of running the country effectively, contrasting himself with rivals like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who lack gubernatorial experience. He mocked Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama's "weak and feckless" foreign policy. Despite his campaign relying on his personality, Christie's record is marred by economic downgrades, anemic job growth, and a scandal-ridden administration. His state's pension system descended into missed payments and lawsuits, and his ethics pledges were overshadowed by controversy. With 55% of Republican voters unable to envision supporting him, Christie faces a challenging uphill battle, relying on his magnetic personality and town hall meetings to rebuild his image. His campaign must overcome his tarnished record and the crowded field of better-funded and more popular rivals. END OF SUMMARY.
