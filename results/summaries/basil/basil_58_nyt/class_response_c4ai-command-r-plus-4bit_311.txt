SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his candidacy for president, vowing to bring strength and decision-making back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as a forthright and forceful leader, unafraid to speak difficult truths. Christie criticized Congress and the president's foreign policy, blaming both parties for dysfunction and gridlock. He acknowledged his own state's economic calamity and vowed to fix the Social Security system. Despite his vulnerabilities and a crowded field of rivals, Christie is betting on his personality and New Hampshire town hall meetings to propel his campaign. Christie's stagecraft and oratory showed room for improvement, and he faces an uphill battle in a field of fresher faces. But he remains a skilled narrator and mythologizer of his own story. The question is whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
