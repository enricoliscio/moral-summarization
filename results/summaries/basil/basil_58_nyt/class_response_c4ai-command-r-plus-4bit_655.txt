SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his candidacy for president, vowing to bring strength, decision-making, and authority back to the Oval Office. Christie, known for his personality and swagger, portrayed himself as a force of candor and truth-telling, unafraid to speak difficult truths. He took swipes at his rivals, particularly those from the Senate, and blamed both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Christie highlighted his experience as governor, claiming he inherited an economic calamity and weathered an unprecedented natural disaster. He criticized Obama's foreign policy and Hillary Clinton, his potential Democratic rival. Christie's campaign strategy focuses on his personality and vulnerability, but he faces challenges due to his wobbly record and judgment. He plans to hold town hall meetings in New Hampshire, forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states. Christie's stagecraft and oratory showed room for improvement, and he faces an uphill battle in a crowded Republican field with better-financed and more popular rivals. His announcement reflected his powers as a narrator and mythologizer of his own story, but it remains to be seen if Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
END OF SUMMARY.
