Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie's presidential candidacy while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Christie declaring his candidacy with a lot of personality, emphasizing his forthrightness and strength. He's positioning himself against other candidates, especially those in Congress, and criticizing Obama and Clinton's foreign policies. He's also addressing the dysfunction in Washington and the need for compromise. However, his record in New Jersey isn't greatâ€”economic issues, pension problems, scandals. Despite this, he's relying on his personality to campaign.

Now, I need to make sure to include the moral words: decision-making, calamity, blamed, dysfunction, gridlock, compromise, fix, missed, payments, conspired, mire, scandal, lying, stealing, forgoing. 

I should structure the summary to cover his declaration, his strengths, his criticisms, his weaknesses, and his campaign strategy. I'll need to weave in the moral terms naturally without forcing them. Let me start drafting:

"Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, highlighting his forthrightness and strength, while criticizing Washington's dysfunction and gridlock. He blamed Congress and President Obama for weak foreign policies and emphasized the need for decisive leadership. Despite his record in New Jersey being marred by economic calamity, missed payments, and scandals, Christie is focusing on his personality to appeal to voters. He criticized rivals like Rubio and Cruz for lacking governance experience and Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama's policies. Christie's campaign is built around town hall meetings, forgoing traditional early-state tours, as he seeks to regain momentum despite challenges in a crowded field."

Wait, I should check if I included all the moral words. I used: decision-making (implicitly), calamity, blamed, dysfunction, gridlock, compromise (not directly, but maybe can include), fix (not directly), missed, payments, conspired (not used), mire (not used), scandal, lying (not used), stealing (not used), forgoing.

Hmm, I missed some. Let me adjust:

"Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy, emphasizing his forthrightness and strength, while criticizing Washington's dysfunction and gridlock. He blamed Congress and President Obama for weak foreign policies and stressed the need for decisive leadership. Despite his record in New Jersey being marred by economic calamity, missed payments, and scandals, Christie is focusing on his personality to appeal to voters. He criticized rivals like Rubio and Cruz for lacking governance experience and Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama's policies, which he described as feckless. Christie's campaign is built around town hall meetings, forgoing traditional early-state tours, as he seeks to regain momentum despite challenges in a crowded field."

Still missing some. Let me try again, including more:

"Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy, emphasizing his forthrightness and strength, while criticizing Washington's dysfunction and gridlock. He blamed Congress and President Obama for weak foreign policies and stressed the need for decisive leadership. Despite his record in New Jersey being marred by economic calamity, missed payments, and scandals, Christie is focusing on his personality to appeal to voters. He criticized rivals like Rubio and Cruz for lacking governance experience and Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama's policies, which he described as feckless. Christie's campaign is built around town hall meetings, forgoing traditional early-state tours, as he seeks to regain momentum despite challenges in a crowded field."

I think I included: decision-making (implicitly), calamity, blamed, dysfunction, gridlock, compromise (not directly), fix (not directly), missed, payments, scandal, forgoing. Still missing 'fix', 'conspired','mire', 'lying','stealing'. Maybe I can't fit all, but I'll try to include as many as possible without making it forced.
