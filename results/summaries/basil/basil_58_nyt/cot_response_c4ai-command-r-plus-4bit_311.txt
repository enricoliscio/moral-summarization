SUMMARY:
With a mix of swagger, disgust for Washington, and unapologetic candor, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey declared his candidacy for president on Tuesday. He vowed to be forthright and forceful, unafraid to speak difficult truths that may make others cringe. Mr. Christie portrayed himself as a leader, not a surrogate for being elected prom king. He criticized Congress and the President for their dysfunction and gridlock, blaming both parties. He also took a swipe at his rivals, particularly those from the Senate, for their lack of executive experience. Mr. Christie, however, faces significant challenges, including a wobbly record and a scandal back home. His campaign must rely heavily on his personality, a mix of charm, banter, vulnerability, and effrontery. He plans to focus on New Hampshire, holding town hall meetings across the state to showcase his oratory skills. However, he faces a crowded field of rivals who are better financed, more conservative, and more liked by Republican voters. The question remains whether voters will give Mr. Christie, vulnerable after a bruising year, a chance to sell himself anew against fresher faces.
