SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for president, touting his straightforward personality and ability to make tough decisions. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate who can bring strength and authority back to the Oval Office. He took swipes at his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, and criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. Christie also acknowledged the dysfunction in Washington, saying that both parties are to blame. Despite his struggles in New Jersey, including credit downgrades and anemic job growth, Christie is relying on his personality to carry his campaign. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters. Christie's announcement was marked by his characteristic bluntness and humor, but also showed vulnerabilities in his campaign.
