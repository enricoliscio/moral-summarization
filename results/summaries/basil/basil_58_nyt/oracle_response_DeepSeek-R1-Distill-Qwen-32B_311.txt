Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article about Chris Christie's presidential campaign. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing words used by the author. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Christie declaring his candidacy with a strong, New Jersey-style approach. He emphasizes his forthrightness and experience as a governor, contrasting himself with other candidates. He's critical of Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, and he's not afraid to tell difficult truths. 

Looking at the list of morally framed words provided, I need to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. Words like "run," "decision-making," "calamity," "dysfunction," "gridlock," "under," "turned," "downgrades," "growth," "descended," "payments," "lawsuits," "conspired," "mire," "scandal," "stretched," "lying," "stealing," "horse," "get," "force" are key here.

I should structure the summary to highlight Christie's strengths and weaknesses, using those words. He's positioning himself as a strong leader, but his record is under scrutiny. The economic downturn, pension issues, and scandals are important points to include, as they show the "calamity" and "scandal" aspects. 

Also, his campaign strategy relies on his personality, which includes both charm and confrontational tactics. The contrast with other candidates like Trump and Rubio should be mentioned, as well as the challenges he faces in the Republican field.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while incorporating the moral framing words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the words are appropriately included.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his uphill presidential candidacy with New Jersey-style swagger, emphasizing his forthrightness and experience as a governor. He criticized Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, positioning himself as a strong leader capable of decision-making and authority. Christie mocked his rivals, particularly those without state governance experience, and highlighted his ability to handle crises like Hurricane Sandy. However, his record is under scrutiny, with economic downgrades, anemic job growth, and a mired pension system. His administration has also faced scandals, including traffic-related controversies. Despite these challenges, Christie relies on his personality—quick wit, empathy, and effrontery—to appeal to voters. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, avoiding traditional early-state tours. His campaign faces significant hurdles, including better-funded rivals and a lack of voter enthusiasm, with only 55% of Republicans unable to envision supporting him. Christie’s narrative centers on his authenticity and strength, but his oratory and stagecraft remain uneven. END OF SUMMARY.
