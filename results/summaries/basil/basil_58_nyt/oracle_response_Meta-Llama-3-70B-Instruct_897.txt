SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to overcome his rivals. He vowed to campaign and govern with strength, decision-making, and authority, even if it means telling difficult truths. Christie took a swipe at his Senate rivals, saying they lack experience in running a state government, unlike him who inherited an "economic calamity" and weathered Hurricane Sandy. He blamed both parties for Washington's "dysfunction" and "gridlock," and criticized President Obama's foreign policy as "weak and feckless." Christie's campaign will focus on his personality, which he hopes will overcome his vulnerabilities, including a struggling state economy with "downgrades" and "anemic job growth." He plans to hold town hall meetings in New Hampshire, where he will rely on his "magnetic mix" of charm, empathy, and effrontery to connect with voters. Despite his flaws, Christie hopes to "get" the country back on track with "force" and honesty.
