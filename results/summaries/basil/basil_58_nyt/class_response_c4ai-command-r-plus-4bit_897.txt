SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2016 presidential race, touting his New Jersey-style swagger and unconcealed disgust for Washington. With his record and judgment as governor under scrutiny, Christie is betting on his raw and prodigious personality to carry his campaign. He vows to be forthright and forceful, running on a platform of strength, decision-making, and authority. Christie takes aim at his rivals, particularly those from the Senate, claiming they lack the experience of running a state government. He also blames both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington, arguing that compromise is essential. Despite his vulnerabilities and a crowded field of better-financed and more popular rivals, Christie is confident in his ability to sell himself anew to Republican voters. He plans to focus on New Hampshire, holding town hall meetings to showcase his quick-witted charm and political prowess. Only time will tell if Christie's strategy will be enough to overcome his recent scandals and the challenges of his centrist position within the Republican Party.
