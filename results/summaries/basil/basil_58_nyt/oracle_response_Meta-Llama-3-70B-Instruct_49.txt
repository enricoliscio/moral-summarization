SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to overcome his rivals. He vowed to campaign and govern with strength and decision-making, even if it means telling difficult truths. Christie took a swipe at his Senate rivals, saying they lack experience in running a state government. He blamed Congress and President Obama's foreign policy for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Christie's own record, however, has been marred by economic downgrades, anemic job growth, and scandals. Despite this, he plans to build his campaign around his personality, using town hall meetings to connect with voters. Christie's announcement was marked by emotional power, as he recalled his father's humble beginnings and his own rise to governor. The question now is whether Republican voters will give Christie a fighting chance to sell himself anew, despite his vulnerabilities.
