SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to set himself apart from other Republican candidates. Christie vowed to be a straight shooter, even if it means telling difficult truths, and criticized his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, for lacking executive experience. He also blasted Congress and the Obama administration's foreign policy, saying the country needs strength and decision-making in the Oval Office. Christie's campaign will focus on his town hall meetings, which have been a hallmark of his governorship, and he plans to spend a week in New Hampshire holding multiple town halls. Despite his efforts, Christie faces an uphill battle, with 55% of Republican primary voters saying they cannot envision voting for him.

END OF SUMMARY.
