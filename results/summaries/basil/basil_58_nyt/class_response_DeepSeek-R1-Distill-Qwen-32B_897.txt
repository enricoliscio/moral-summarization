Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie's presidential candidacy while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that must be included. Let me go through the article and pick out the key points and those specific words.

First, the article talks about Christie declaring his candidacy with New Jersey-style confidence. He emphasizes his forthrightness and strength, using words like "decision-making" and "calamity." He criticizes his rivals, especially those in the Senate, for not having governance experience. He also criticizes Congress and Obama's foreign policy, using terms like "dysfunction" and "gridlock."

Christie's record isn't great; there's been economic issues, pension problems, and scandals. He's relying on his personality now, which includes traits like charm and effrontery. The article mentions he's forgoing the usual campaign tour, instead focusing on New Hampshire town halls. His campaign has vulnerabilities, especially since he's a centrist from the Northeast in a crowded field.

I need to include all the listed moral words: decision-making, calamity, blamed, dysfunction, gridlock, compromise, fix, missed, payments, conspired, mire, scandal, lying, stealing, forgoing. I'll structure the summary to touch on each of these points concisely, making sure the moral framing is clear. I'll aim for around 200 words, keeping it within the limit.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his uphill presidential candidacy with New Jersey-style confidence, emphasizing his forthrightness and strength. He criticized Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, blaming Congress and President Obama's foreign policy for weakness. Christie highlighted his experience as governor, claiming he's the only candidate capable of effective decision-making, having navigated economic calamity and Hurricane Sandy. However, his record is marred by credit downgrades, anemic job growth, pension system failures, and scandals. Now, Christie is relying on his personality—quick-witted charm and effrontery—to rebuild his campaign. He forgoes the traditional early-voting state tour, instead focusing on New Hampshire town halls. Despite his efforts, Christie faces significant challenges, including a lack of voter support and a crowded field of better-financed and more appealing rivals. His campaign is a mix of emotional appeals and clichés, with questionable stagecraft and oratory, leaving it uncertain if Republican voters will give him a fighting chance. END OF SUMMARY.
