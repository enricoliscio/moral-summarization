SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his candor and decision-making abilities as key strengths. He vowed to campaign and govern with forceful honesty, even if it makes people cringe. Christie took aim at his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, saying they lack experience running a state government. He also blasted Congress and President Obama's foreign policy, calling it "weak and feckless." Christie blamed both parties for Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, saying compromise is not a dirty word. Despite his own scandals and missed payments in New Jersey, Christie promised to fix the state pension system and bring authority back to the Oval Office. He will focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, relying on his personality to win over voters. However, Christie's campaign faces significant vulnerabilities, including a wide field of better-financed and better-liked rivals.
