END OF SUMMARY
SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president with a swagger, vowing to bring strength, decision-making, and authority back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as forthright and forceful, promising to tell difficult truths even if they made people cringe. He expressed disgust for Washington, blaming both parties for dysfunction and gridlock. Christie's campaign relies heavily on his personality and his ability to connect with voters. His record as governor, however, is wobbly with vulnerabilities such as credit downgrades, anemic job growth, and a scandal. He faces a challenging path to the Republican nomination, with better-financed and more beloved rivals. Christie's oratory and stagecraft need improvement, but he speaks with emotional power and vulnerability. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a fighting chance to rewrite his story and sell himself anew.
