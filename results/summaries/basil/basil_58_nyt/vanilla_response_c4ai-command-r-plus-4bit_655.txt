SUMMARY: Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, portraying himself as a blunt and forceful leader who is unafraid to speak his mind. With his trademark swagger and disdain for Washington, Christie vowed to be a teller of difficult truths and criticized both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Congress. He positioned himself as a centrist candidate with executive experience, taking swipes at his Republican rivals who have never run a state government. Christie highlighted his record as governor, despite recent scandals and economic challenges in New Jersey. He plans to focus his campaign on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, forgoing the traditional tour of early-voting states. However, Christie faces an uphill battle in a crowded and well-funded Republican field, with many voters already expressing reluctance to support him. Christie's campaign hinges on his personality and ability to sell himself anew to Republican voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
