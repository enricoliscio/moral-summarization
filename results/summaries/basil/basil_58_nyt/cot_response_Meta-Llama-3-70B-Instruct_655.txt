SUMMARY:
Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy with a promise to bring "strength" and "authority" back to the Oval Office. He vowed to be a "forthright" and "forceful" leader who will tell difficult truths, even if it makes people "cringe." Christie took a swipe at his rivals, calling them out for their lack of executive experience and "weak" foreign policy. He also blamed Congress for "dysfunction" and "gridlock." Despite his own scandals and "feckless" leadership, Christie is relying on his "candor" and "empathy" to win over voters. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, where he can showcase his "vulnerability" and "effrontery." Christie's campaign is built around his personality, which is a mix of "charm," "banter," and "empathy." Will Republican voters give him a chance to redeem himself and become the next president?
