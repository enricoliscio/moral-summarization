Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie's presidential candidacy while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Okay, so Christie is declaring his candidacy with a lot of confidence and criticism towards Washington. He's emphasizing his straight-talking personality as his main advantage. He's also criticizing his rivals, especially those in the Senate who haven't run a state. He's pointing out his experience with the economy and Hurricane Sandy.

He's also taking shots at Obama's foreign policy and Hillary Clinton, calling her Obama's "second mate." He's blaming both parties for Washington's dysfunction. 

But the article also points out that his record isn't great. New Jersey's economy isn't doing well, the pension system is in trouble, and there's been scandal. His approval among Republicans isn't high, with 55% saying they can't imagine voting for him. 

Christie is relying on his personality, which is a mix of charm and bluntness. He's planning to use town hall meetings, especially in New Hampshire, to campaign. However, he's facing a tough field with better-funded and more popular candidates.

So, the moral framing here is that Christie is positioning himself as the strong, truthful leader needed, but his record and public image are problematic. He's a flawed candidate trying to overcome his shortcomings with his personality and experience.

I need to capture all this in a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting his strengths and weaknesses, and the moral implications of his candidacy.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie launched his uphill presidential campaign with a bold, New Jersey-style declaration, emphasizing his forthrightness and experience over better-funded and more popular rivals. He criticized Washington's dysfunction and his Senate rivals for lacking state governance experience, while also attacking President Obama's foreign policy and Hillary Clinton's potential continuation of it. Christie, however, faces significant challenges: his record in New Jersey has been marked by economic struggles, pension crises, and scandals, and only 45% of Republican primary voters can envision supporting him. To overcome these shortcomings, Christie is banking on his magnetic personality and plans to focus on town hall-style campaigning in New Hampshire. His campaign hinges on his ability to reinvent himself as a strong, truthful leader, despite his centrist roots and a crowded field dominated by more appealing candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
