SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his straightforward personality and experience as a governor. Christie portrayed himself as a truthful and forceful leader, willing to make tough decisions. He criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy, and took a swipe at his Republican rivals, particularly those in the Senate. Christie's campaign will focus on his personality, which he believes sets him apart from other candidates. He plans to hold numerous town hall meetings in New Hampshire, forgoing the traditional tour of early-voting states. Despite his efforts, Christie faces significant challenges, including a crowded field of better-financed and more popular candidates. His own record as governor has been marred by scandals and economic struggles. Christie must now convince Republican voters to give him a second chance.
