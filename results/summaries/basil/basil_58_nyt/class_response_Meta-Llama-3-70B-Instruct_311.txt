SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, vowing to bring "strength and decision-making" back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as the only candidate who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country, willing to tell difficult truths even if they make people "cringe." Christie took a swipe at his rivals, saying they lack experience in governing a state, and blamed both parties for the "dysfunction" and "gridlock" in Washington. He also criticized President Obama's foreign policy, calling it "weak and feckless." Christie's campaign is built around his personality, which he hopes will help him overcome his vulnerabilities, including a troubled record as governor and low popularity among Republican voters. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters and sell himself anew. Despite his efforts, Christie's campaign faces significant challenges, including a crowded field of better-financed and better-liked rivals.
