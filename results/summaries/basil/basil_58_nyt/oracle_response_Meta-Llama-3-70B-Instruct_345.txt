SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to overcome his rivals. He vowed to campaign and govern as a teller of difficult truths, even if it makes people cringe. Christie took a swipe at his Senate rivals, saying they've never run a state government, and blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. He criticized President Obama's foreign policy, calling it "weak and feckless," and warned against turning it over to Hillary Clinton. Christie's own record as governor has been marred by economic calamity, credit downgrades, and anemic job growth, as well as scandals and lawsuits. Despite this, he plans to build his campaign around his personality, which he believes can overcome his vulnerabilities. Christie will focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters and sell himself anew. The question is whether Republican voters will give him a fighting chance to turn his fortunes around.
