SUMMARY:
Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his forthright and forceful personality as a strength in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals. He vowed to run the country with authority, making difficult decisions and telling uncomfortable truths, even if they make voters cringe. Christie took a swipe at his Senate rivals, saying they lack the executive experience he gained as governor of New Jersey. He blamed both parties for Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, calling for compromise. Christie's announcement was marked by emotional power, as he recalled his father's humble beginnings and his own rise to governor. However, his campaign faces serious vulnerabilities, including a weak record and judgment. Christie will focus on his personality and town hall meetings to connect with voters. END OF SUMMARY.
