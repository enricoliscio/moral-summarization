Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Chris Christie's presidential candidacy. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author provided. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about Christie declaring his candidacy with confidence, emphasizing his personality and experience. He's critical of Washington and other candidates, especially those in Congress and Obama's foreign policy. He's trying to position himself as the only one capable and forthright enough to lead. However, his record in New Jersey isn't stellar, with economic issues and scandals. Despite this, he's relying on his personality to make a campaign.

I need to make sure the summary includes his strengths, like his personality and experience, and his weaknesses, like his record and challenges in the race. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”Christie is portrayed as a straight-talker against Washington's dysfunction, but his own record is problematic.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Start with his declaration, his criticisms, his campaign focus on personality, mention his record issues, and his uphill battle in the race. Conclude with the question of whether voters will support him despite the challenges.

Let me structure this: introduce Christie's candidacy, his strengths and criticisms, his campaign strategy, his record issues, and the challenges ahead. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy with confidence, emphasizing his personality and experience as his key advantages. He criticized Washington's dysfunction, weak foreign policy under Obama, and his rivals, particularly those without state governance experience. Christie positioned himself as a forthright leader capable of making tough decisions, contrasting himself with more popular or better-funded candidates. However, his record in New Jersey, marked by economic struggles, pension issues, and scandals, undermines his campaign. Despite these challenges, Christie is focusing on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, leveraging his charm and direct communication style. His uphill battle includes competing with candidates like Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio, who appeal to different voter bases. The question remains whether Republican voters will give Christie a chance to redefine his narrative.  
END OF SUMMARY.
