SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his candor and forthrightness as key qualities for the Oval Office. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate who can tell difficult truths, even if they're unpopular. He took aim at his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, and reserved his strongest criticism for Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. Christie also acknowledged the dysfunction in Washington, blaming both parties for the gridlock. Despite his struggles in New Jersey, including credit downgrades and scandals, Christie is relying on his personality to carry his campaign. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters. However, Christie faces significant challenges, including a crowded field of better-financed and more popular candidates.
