SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie launched his presidential campaign in New Jersey on Tuesday, relying on his personality as his biggest advantage in a crowded Republican field. Christie portrayed himself as a candid and forceful leader, vowing to speak difficult truths and criticizing Washington dysfunction. He took swipes at his rivals, including senators and Hillary Clinton, and blamed both parties for gridlock. Despite a spectacular loss of stature in his second term as governor, Christie highlighted his experience and record in New Jersey, invoking the economic crisis and Hurricane Sandy. He must now build his campaign around his personality and raw assets, with a focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire. Christie faces well-financed and well-liked rivals, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, and has low favorability among Republican voters. At his announcement, Christie sought rebirth by mythologizing his own story and emphasizing his working-class roots. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
