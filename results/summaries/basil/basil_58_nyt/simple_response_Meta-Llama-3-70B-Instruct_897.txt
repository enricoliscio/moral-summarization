SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to set him apart from his rivals. Christie portrayed himself as a forthright and forceful leader who will tell difficult truths, even if they are unpopular. He took a swipe at his Senate rivals, citing his experience as a governor, and criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. Christie also blamed both parties for Washington's dysfunction. Despite his troubled record in New Jersey, Christie is banking on his charm, empathy, and vulnerability to connect with voters. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to build his campaign. However, Christie faces significant challenges, including a crowded field of better-financed and more popular candidates. His announcement speech showed flashes of emotional power, but also relied on clich√©s. The question now is whether Republican voters will give Christie a chance to reboot his campaign.
