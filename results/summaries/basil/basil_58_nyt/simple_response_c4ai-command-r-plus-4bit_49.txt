SUMMARY: Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, relying on his personality as his biggest advantage in a field of better-financed and more popular rivals. Christie portrayed himself as the only forthright and forceful candidate in the Republican field, vowing to speak the truth and make tough decisions. He criticized Washington for its dysfunction and gridlock, blaming both parties, and took swipes at his rivals, including Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, for their lack of executive experience. Christie highlighted his own record as governor of New Jersey, despite recent setbacks and scandals, and positioned himself as a centrist candidate from the Northeast. However, he faces an uphill battle in a crowded and well-funded Republican field, with low favorability among Republican voters. Christie's announcement showcased his distinctive style, a mix of charm, banter, vulnerability, and bluntness, as he seeks to rebuild his image and appeal to voters in New Hampshire with a series of town hall meetings. Despite his challenges, Christie remains confident in his ability to connect with voters and sell himself as a leader who can get things done.
END OF SUMMARY.
