Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie declaring his presidential candidacy. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Christie declared his candidacy with New Jersey-style confidence. He emphasizes his personality and experience, contrasting himself with other candidates who are better financed or more liked. He talks about being forthright and forceful, which he believes are necessary traits for the presidency.

He criticizes his rivals, especially those in the Senate like Rubio and Cruz, for not having state governance experience. He also takes a shot at Hillary Clinton, criticizing Obama's foreign policy and suggesting it shouldn't be continued under her. He's critical of both parties in Washington for dysfunction.

The article then goes into Christie's political background, noting his rise and subsequent loss of stature. His promises on the economy and pensions haven't panned out, leading to issues like credit downgrades and scandals. Polls show that many Republicans don't want to vote for him, making his campaign challenging.

Christie is relying on his personalityâ€”his charm, wit, and ability to connect with people. He's planning to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, avoiding the usual early-state tour. However, his campaign faces significant challenges, including a crowded field and his own political vulnerabilities.

Putting this together, the summary should cover Christie's declaration, his emphasis on personality and experience, criticism of rivals and Washington, his political background and challenges, and his campaign strategy focusing on town halls despite the obstacles.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these key points without getting too detailed.
