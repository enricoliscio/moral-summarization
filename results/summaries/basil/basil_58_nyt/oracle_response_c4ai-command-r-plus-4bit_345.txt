SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, presenting himself as a force of candor and decision-making in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals. Christie vowed to speak difficult truths and criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. He blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Despite his swagger and New Jersey-style personality, Christie faces significant vulnerabilities, including economic downgrades and anemic job growth in his home state. He must rely on his raw and prodigious personality, a mix of charm, banter, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery, to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field. He plans to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states. Christie's stagecraft and oratory showed room for improvement, and he faces a wide field of well-funded and appealing Republican candidates. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
END OF SUMMARY.
