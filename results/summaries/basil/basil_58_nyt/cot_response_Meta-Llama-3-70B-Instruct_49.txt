SUMMARY:
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has declared his candidacy for president, promising to bring "strength" and "authority" to the Oval Office. Christie portrayed himself as a "forthright" and "forceful" leader who will tell difficult truths, even if they make people "cringe." He criticized his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, for lacking executive experience. Christie also blasted Congress and President Obama's foreign policy as "weak" and "feckless." He vowed to campaign and govern with "candor" and "empathy," despite his own record of "scandal" and "ethics" issues in New Jersey. Christie's campaign will focus on his personality, which he hopes will overcome his vulnerabilities and help him win over Republican voters. END OF SUMMARY.
