SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his straight-talking style and leadership experience. Christie vowed to campaign and govern with candor, even if it's unpopular, and positioned himself as the only candidate who can provide strength and decision-making in the Oval Office. He took swipes at his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, and criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. Christie also acknowledged the dysfunction in Washington, saying both parties are to blame. Despite his struggles in New Jersey, Christie is relying on his personality to propel his campaign, which has been plagued by credit downgrades, pension system issues, and scandals. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters. Christie faces an uphill battle, with 55% of Republican primary voters saying they cannot envision voting for him.
