SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his presidential candidacy, relying on his personality and candor to set himself apart from other Republican candidates. Christie vowed to campaign and govern as a teller of difficult truths, even if it makes people cringe. He took a swipe at his rivals, saying that unlike them, he has experience running a state government and has navigated economic calamity and natural disasters. Christie blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington, saying that compromise is not a dirty word. He also criticized President Obama's foreign policy, calling it "weak and feckless." Christie's campaign is centered around his personality, which he hopes will help him overcome his vulnerabilities, including a struggling record as governor and low popularity among Republican voters. Despite his efforts, Christie's campaign faces significant challenges, including a wide field of candidates and his own history of scandal and missed payments.
