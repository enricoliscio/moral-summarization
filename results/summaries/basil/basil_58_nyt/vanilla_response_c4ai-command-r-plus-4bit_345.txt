SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his candidacy for president on Tuesday in Livingston, New Jersey, with a focus on his personality and a promise of candor and forcefulness. He portrayed himself as a teller of difficult truths and a strong leader, vowing to bring decision-making and authority back to the Oval Office. Christie took swipes at his rivals, particularly those from the Senate, and blamed both parties for dysfunction in Washington. He highlighted his experience as governor and his ability to handle economic and natural disasters. However, Christie faces significant challenges, including a weak record as governor, low popularity, and a crowded field of well-funded and well-liked rivals. Christie plans to focus his campaign on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, emphasizing his raw and prodigious personality. His announcement speech showcased his quick-witted charm and vulnerability, but also revealed room for improvement in his oratory and stagecraft. Christie's challenge will be to sell himself anew to Republican voters who have a long list of fresher faces to choose from.
