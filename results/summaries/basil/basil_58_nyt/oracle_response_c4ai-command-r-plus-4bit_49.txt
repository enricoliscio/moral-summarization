SUMMARY: With a swagger that evokes his home state of New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, basing his uphill campaign on his forceful personality and willingness to speak hard truths. Christie portrayed himself as a strong decision-maker, a sharp contrast to the dysfunction and gridlock of Washington. He vowed to be candid and forthright, criticizing his rivals in the Senate and Congress for their feckless leadership. Christie highlighted his experience as governor, citing the economic calamity and Hurricane Sandy as challenges he weathered. However, his own record faces scrutiny, with credit downgrades and ethical scandals. Christie's strategy relies heavily on his raw, magnetic personality and his ability to connect with voters through town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire. Despite his vulnerabilities and a crowded field of better-funded and more conservative rivals, Christie is betting that his forceful style and oratory will set him apart. He is positioning himself as a mythologizer of his own story, seeking political rebirth on a national stage.
