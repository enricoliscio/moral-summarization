SUMMARY:
Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, relying heavily on his personality and New Jersey-style swagger to set himself apart from his Republican rivals. Christie portrayed himself as a forceful and candid leader, unafraid to speak difficult truths and make tough decisions, even if it made others cringe. He took swipes at his rivals, including senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, blaming both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Christie's campaign faces serious vulnerabilities and moral wobblies; he is a centrist from the Northeast, competing against better-financed and more conservative candidates who are beloved by mainstream donors and Republican voters alike. Despite these challenges, Christie is hoping to sell himself as a magnetic, quick-witted, and empathetic leader with a strong record as governor. He plans to focus his campaign on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, where he will attempt to mythologize himself as a force for truth and decision-making in the Oval Office. Christie's oratory, however, may need refinement to avoid descending into clich√©s and to effectively convey his message of strength and candor. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to redefine himself and rise above his moral vulnerabilities and recent disgraces.
