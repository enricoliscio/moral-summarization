SUMMARY:
Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey announced his candidacy for president with a swaggering speech filled with disgust for Washington and pride in his own candor. Vowing to be forthright and forceful, he portrayed himself as a teller of difficult truths who is willing to make voters cringe. He swiped at his rivals, particularly those from the Senate, and blamed both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Christie's candidacy, however, belies serious vulnerabilities in his campaign. As a centrist from the Northeast, he faces a difficult path to the Republican nomination, with well-funded and better-liked rivals. His record as governor has also come under scrutiny, with economic and ethical woes tarnishing his once-promising reputation. Christie's oratory and stagecraft also showed room for improvement. The question remains whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew, despite his disgraced reputation.
