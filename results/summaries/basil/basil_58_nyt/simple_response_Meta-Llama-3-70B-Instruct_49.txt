SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his candor and forthrightness as a refreshing change from Washington's politics-as-usual. Christie portrayed himself as a strong and decisive leader who will tell difficult truths, even if they're unpopular. He took aim at his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, and criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. Christie also acknowledged the dysfunction in Washington, saying that compromise is essential. Despite his struggles in New Jersey, Christie is relying on his personality and charisma to win over voters. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, starting with a week-long stint in New Hampshire. However, Christie faces significant challenges, including a crowded field of better-financed and more popular candidates. His campaign's success will depend on whether voters are willing to give him a second chance to prove himself.
