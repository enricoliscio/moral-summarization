SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday in Livingston, New Jersey, with a swagger and a high regard for his own candor. He portrayed himself as the only Republican candidate who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country and vowed to be a colorful teller of difficult truths. Mr. Christie tried to distinguish himself from his rivals, particularly those who have never run a state government like Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. He also expressed his disdain for Congress and the President's stewardship of foreign affairs. Mr. Christie's announcement comes at a time when his own record and judgment as governor are under scrutiny, and his popularity among Republican voters is low. He is now building his campaign around his personality, which is a mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery. Mr. Christie plans to focus his campaign on New Hampshire, holding town hall meetings across the state in the hopes of appealing to Republican voters. However, he faces an uphill battle against a wide field of well-funded and well-liked rivals. END OF SUMMARY.
