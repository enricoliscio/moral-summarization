SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, promising to bring his trademark candor and forcefulness to the White House. With his once-promising political career damaged by scandal and economic woes in his home state, Christie is relying on his personality to distinguish himself in a crowded field of Republican contenders. He portrayed himself as a straight-talker who is unafraid to speak hard truths and criticized his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, for their lack of executive experience. Christie also blamed both parties for gridlock in Washington and criticized President Obama and Hillary Clinton for their handling of foreign policy. Despite his weakened position, Christie is betting on his charisma and a focus on New Hampshire to propel him to the Republican nomination. However, he faces well-funded and well-liked opponents, including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio, who may prove more appealing to Republican voters. Christie's announcement reflected his penchant for mythologizing his own story, but he will need to convince voters to give him a chance to rewrite his narrative after a difficult year.
