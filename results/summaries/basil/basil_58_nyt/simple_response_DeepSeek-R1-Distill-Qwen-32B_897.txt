Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Chris Christie announcing his presidential candidacy. Let me read through it carefully.

The key points are Christie's declaration with confidence, his criticism of Washington and other candidates, his focus on personality, and his challenges. I should highlight his strengths and weaknesses, including his record and the doubts about his viability. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects, like his criticism of others and his own record issues. Also, include his campaign strategy and the challenges he faces in the Republican field.

Let me structure the summary: start with his announcement, mention his personality as his main asset, his criticisms, his record problems, and the tough path ahead. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy with confidence, emphasizing his forthrightness and experience as a leader. He criticized Washington's dysfunction, his rivals for lacking gubernatorial experience, and Hillary Clinton for continuing Obama's weak foreign policy. Despite his strong personality and campaign strategy focused on town halls, Christie faces challenges: a damaged record, including economic struggles and scandals, and a crowded Republican field with better-funded and more popular candidates. His campaign hinges on his magnetic, if polarizing, personality, but his viability remains uncertain as many Republicans doubt his ability to lead. END OF SUMMARY.
