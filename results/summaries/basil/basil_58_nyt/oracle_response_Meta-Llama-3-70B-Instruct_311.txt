SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, vowing to bring strength, decision-making, and authority back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as the only candidate who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country, willing to tell difficult truths even if it makes people cringe. Christie took a swipe at his rivals, saying they lack the experience of running a state government, and reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. He blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington, saying compromise is not a dirty word. Christie's campaign is built around his personality, which he hopes will help him overcome his vulnerabilities, including a weak record and poor judgment. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters. Despite his efforts, Christie's campaign faces serious challenges, including a wide field of candidates and his own scandals.

END OF SUMMARY.
