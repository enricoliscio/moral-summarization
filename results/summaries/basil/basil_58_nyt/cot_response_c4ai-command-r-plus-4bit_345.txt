END OF SUMMARY
SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday with a swagger, disgust for Washington, and a high regard for his candor. He portrayed himself as the only Republican candidate who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country, vowing to be a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if it makes people cringe. Christie took swipes at his rivals in the Senate and Congress, blaming both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. He also criticized President Obama's foreign policy as "weak and feckless." Christie's campaign faces serious vulnerabilities, including a wobbly record and judgment as governor. His personality, a mix of charm, vulnerability, and effrontery, may be his most raw and prodigious asset. He plans to focus his campaign on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states. However, he faces an uphill battle in a crowded field of better-financed and more beloved candidates. Christie is betting on his storytelling and mythologizing skills to sell himself anew to Republican voters, but it remains to be seen if they will give him a fighting chance in the face of fresher faces and a bruising year of scandal and setbacks.
