Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his presidential candidacy. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used, and they provided a list of morally charged words to include. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral elements.

The article starts by describing Christie's announcement with his personality and style. He's using his experience as a governor to position himself as a strong leader, contrasting himself with other candidates. The author uses words like "decision-making" and "calamity" to highlight his achievements but also points out his record's flaws, using terms like "dysfunction," "gridlock," "compromise," "fix," "missed payments," "scandal," "lying," "stealing," and "forgoing." 

Christie's campaign is built around his personality, but the article questions whether that's enough given his tarnished record. He's facing tough competition, including Trump and others, and his past successes have led to some failures, like the economy and pension issues. The author also mentions his reliance on town halls, which might not be enough for a national campaign.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those morally framed words as possible. I should structure it to show Christie's strengths and weaknesses, using the provided terms. I'll start by introducing his candidacy, mention his emphasis on strength and decision-making, then contrast that with his record's issues. I'll include the negative terms to show the criticism and his challenges in the race.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me draft it, ensuring I hit all the key points and include the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his uphill presidential candidacy with a focus on his personality, emphasizing his "decision-making" and "strength" as key qualities for leadership. He criticized Washington's "dysfunction" and "gridlock," blaming both parties for the political stalemate. Christie highlighted his experience in managing "economic calamity" and "unprecedented natural disasters," but his record has faced criticism, including "missed payments," "scandal," and accusations of "lying" and "stealing." His campaign, built on his "personality," aims to appeal through town hall meetings, forgoing traditional early-state tours. However, Christie faces challenges as a centrist from the Northeast in a crowded field, with many voters expressing skepticism. His reliance on his "narrative" and "oratory" may not be enough to overcome his tarnished image and weak "judgment." END OF SUMMARY.
