Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his presidential candidacy. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that Christie declared his candidacy with New Jersey-style confidence, criticizing Washington and emphasizing his honesty. He's positioning himself as the only forthright and forceful candidate in the Republican field. He vows to campaign and govern by telling difficult truths, even if it's uncomfortable. He's not running to be the most popular or a "prom king."

He criticizes his rivals, especially those in the Senate like Rubio and Cruz, for not having run a state government. He also takes shots at Obama's foreign policy and Hillary Clinton. He's critical of both parties for Washington's dysfunction.

The article mentions that his record as governor isn't great. The economic recovery didn't happen as promised, pensions are in trouble, and there's been scandal. His approval among Republicans is low, only 45% would consider voting for him, which is worse than Trump.

Christie is relying on his personality, which is a mix of charm, banter, and bluntness. He's planning to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, skipping the usual early-state tour. He's trying to rebrand himself, but faces tough competition from better-funded and more popular candidates.

Putting this together, the summary should cover his announcement, his strengths (personality, honesty), weaknesses (poor record, low approval), and his strategy (town halls in NH). It should be concise, under 200 words, and in the specified format.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy with a focus on his personality, honesty, and experience as a state governor. He criticized Washington's dysfunction, rival candidates like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz for lacking state governance experience, and Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama's foreign policy. Christie's record in New Jersey, however, is marred by economic struggles, pension issues, and scandals, leading to low approval among Republicans. He is banking on his charm and forceful communication, planning to campaign through town halls in New Hampshire. Despite his efforts, he faces strong competition from better-funded and more popular candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
