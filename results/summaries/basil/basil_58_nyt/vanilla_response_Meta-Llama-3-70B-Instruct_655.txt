SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for president, relying on his personality and candor to set him apart from other Republican candidates. Christie vowed to campaign and govern as a teller of difficult truths, even if it makes people uncomfortable. He took a swipe at his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, and criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy. Christie also blamed both parties for Washington's dysfunction. Despite his struggles in New Jersey, including credit downgrades and scandals, Christie is building his campaign around his personality, which includes charm, empathy, and effrontery. He plans to focus on town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire, to connect with voters. Christie's announcement was marked by his emotional power and storytelling ability, but also showed room for improvement in his stagecraft and oratory.
