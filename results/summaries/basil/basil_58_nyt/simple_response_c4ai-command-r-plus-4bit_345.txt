SUMMARY: Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, announced his candidacy for the presidency on Tuesday. With his home-state swagger and trademark bluntness, he portrayed himself as a straight-talker who is unafraid to speak hard truths. He vowed to restore strength and decision-making to the Oval Office, criticizing both parties for the dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Mr. Christie's campaign relies heavily on his magnetic personality, which blends quick-witted charm, banter, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery. He aims to set himself apart from his rivals, particularly those in the Senate who have never governed a state. Mr. Christie acknowledged the challenges he faces, including economic downturns and ethical scandals during his governorship. However, he remains confident in his ability to connect with voters and sell himself anew. He plans to focus his campaign on New Hampshire, holding town hall meetings to engage directly with voters. Despite his vulnerabilities and a crowded field of better-funded and more popular rivals, Mr. Christie believes his unfiltered style and forceful personality will resonate with Republican voters.
