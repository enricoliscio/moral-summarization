SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy, vowing to bring "strength and decision-making" back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as the only candidate who is forthright and forceful enough to lead the country, willing to tell "difficult truths" even if it makes people "cringe." Christie took a swipe at his rivals, saying they lack the experience of running a state government, and blamed both parties for the "dysfunction" and "gridlock" in Washington. He also criticized President Obama's foreign policy as "weak and feckless." Christie's campaign will focus on his personality, which he hopes will help him overcome his vulnerabilities, including a struggling record as governor and a lack of support from Republican voters. He plans to hold town hall meetings in New Hampshire, where he will try to sell himself anew to voters. Despite his efforts, Christie's campaign faces significant challenges, including a crowded field of candidates and his own "serious and stubborn vulnerabilities."

END OF SUMMARY.
