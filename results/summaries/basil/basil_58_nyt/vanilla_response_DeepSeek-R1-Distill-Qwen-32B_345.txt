Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie announcing his presidential candidacy. Let me read through it carefully to get the main points.

First, the article is about Gov. Chris Christie declaring his run for president with a lot of confidence and his unique style. He's from New Jersey, so that's a key point. He's positioning himself as a straight-talker, which is a big part of his campaign. He's criticizing other candidates, especially those in the Senate like Rubio and Cruz, for not having state governance experience.

He's also taking shots at Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration's foreign policy. That's important because it shows where he stands on key issues. He's emphasizing his own record, but the article mentions that his record isn't as strong as it once wasâ€”there's been some economic trouble and scandals in New Jersey.

Christie is relying on his personality as his main asset, given that his record isn't as impressive anymore. He's planning to focus on town hall meetings, especially in New Hampshire, which is known for that style. But he's facing tough competition from other candidates who have more money, better appeal to conservatives, or more likability.

The article also mentions that he's trying to rebuild his image after a tough year, but it's unclear if Republican voters will give him another chance, especially with so many other candidates in the field.

So, to summarize, I need to capture Christie's announcement, his strengths (personality, straight talk), weaknesses (questionable record), his criticisms of others, and the challenges he faces in the race. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key points without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy with a bold, New Jersey-style campaign, emphasizing his forthrightness and experience as a state governor. He criticized his rivals, particularly those in the Senate, for lacking governance experience, and attacked Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration's foreign policy. Christie, whose record has faced scrutiny due to economic challenges and scandals, is relying on his personality and communication skills to stand out in a crowded field. He plans to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, avoiding traditional early-state tours. However, his centrist background and weakened reputation make his path to the nomination challenging, especially with better-funded and more popular competitors. Christie's campaign hinges on his ability to reinvent himself and appeal to Republican voters amid a crowded field. END OF SUMMARY.
