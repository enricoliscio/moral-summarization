SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie declared his candidacy for president, vowing to bring strength, decision-making, and authority back to the Oval Office. Christie portrayed himself as a forthright and forceful leader, unafraid to speak difficult truths. He criticized Washington for its dysfunction and gridlock, blaming both parties. Christie's candidacy is an uphill battle, with his record as governor facing scrutiny and his popularity waning. He must rely on his personality—a mix of charm, banter, vulnerability, empathy, and effrontery—to sell himself to Republican voters. Christie's campaign strategy centers on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states. He faces well-funded and well-liked rivals and must overcome the negative perception of his governance in New Jersey, including credit downgrades, anemic job growth, and ethical scandals. Christie's oratory and stagecraft showed room for improvement during his announcement, but he remains a skilled narrator and mythologizer of his own story. The question is whether Republican voters will give him a chance to sell himself anew.
