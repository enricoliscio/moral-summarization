SUMMARY:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his candor and decision-making skills as the solution to Washington's dysfunction and gridlock. Christie blamed both parties for the stalemate, emphasizing the need for compromise. He criticized Congress and President Obama's foreign policy, saying it's been "weak and feckless" for seven years. Christie also took a swipe at his rivals, particularly those who have never run a state government, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. He vowed to campaign and govern with strength and authority, even if it means telling difficult truths that might make people cringe. Christie's announcement was marked by his signature swagger and personality, which he hopes will propel him to the top of the Republican field. Despite his vulnerabilities, Christie is relying on his town hall meeting style to connect with voters and overcome his struggles. END OF SUMMARY.
