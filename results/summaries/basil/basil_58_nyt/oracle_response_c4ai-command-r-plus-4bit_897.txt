SUMMARY: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared his candidacy for president, vowing to bring strength, decision-making and authority back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as a forceful and candid leader, unafraid to speak difficult truths. Christie's campaign faces serious challenges, including economic downgrades and anemic job growth in his state, as well as ethical scandals. He blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington, and criticized President Obama's foreign policy. Christie's strategy relies heavily on his personality and town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire. He must overcome better-financed rivals and appeal to conservative voters in a crowded Republican field. Despite his vulnerabilities, Christie remains confident in his ability to sell himself and his story to Republican voters.
