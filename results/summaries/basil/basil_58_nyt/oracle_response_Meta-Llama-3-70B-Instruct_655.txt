SUMMARY:

Gov. Chris Christie declared his presidential candidacy with a bold promise to bring "strength and decision-making and authority back to the Oval Office." He vowed to campaign and govern as a teller of difficult truths, even if it makes people "cringe." Christie took a swipe at his rivals, saying they lack the experience of running a state government, and blasted Congress and President Obama's foreign policy as "weak and feckless." He blamed both parties for Washington's "dysfunction" and "gridlock." Christie's own record as governor has been marred by "calamity," "downgrades," and "scandal." Despite his flaws, Christie is relying on his personality to win over voters, promising to "get" the country back on track and "force" change. He plans to focus on town hall meetings in New Hampshire, hoping to revive his campaign.
