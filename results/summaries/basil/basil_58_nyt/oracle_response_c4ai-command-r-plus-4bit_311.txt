SUMMARY: Gov. Chris Christie announced his candidacy for president on Tuesday, vowing to bring strength and decision-making back to the Oval Office. He portrayed himself as a forthright and forceful leader, unafraid to speak difficult truths. Christie highlighted his experience as governor, criticizing Congress and the president's foreign policy. He blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. Despite his past promise to fix the state pension system, New Jersey has faced economic calamity under Christie's tenure, with credit downgrades and anemic job growth. Christie's administration has also been marred by scandal and accusations of conspiring to mire a town in traffic. His campaign strategy relies heavily on his personality and ability to connect with voters through town hall meetings, particularly in New Hampshire. However, Christie faces an uphill battle in a crowded Republican field, with better-financed and more popular rivals. He must overcome significant vulnerabilities and sell himself anew to Republican voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
