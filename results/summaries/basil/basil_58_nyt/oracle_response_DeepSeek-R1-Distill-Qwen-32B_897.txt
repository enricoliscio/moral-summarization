Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible and be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Gov. Christie is announcing his presidential candidacy, emphasizing his personality and experience. He's critical of Washington's dysfunction and gridlock, and he's positioning himself as a strong, truthful leader. 

I notice the author uses several morally charged words like "run," "decision-making," "calamity," "dysfunction," "gridlock," "downgrades," "scandal," etc. I need to include these in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Christie's announcement, his criticism of Washington, his emphasis on his experience and personality, his attacks on rivals, and the challenges he faces. 

I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, when talking about his record, I'll mention the "economic calamity" and "scandal." When discussing his campaign strategy, I'll include terms like "force" and "truth."

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his candidacy, his strengths, his criticisms, and then the challenges he faces. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

I should also check that the summary captures the essence of the article, including Christie's self-proclaimed strengths and the doubts about his campaign due to his record and the crowded field.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary is under 200 words and that it effectively uses the morally framed words provided.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Chris Christie declared his uphill presidential candidacy with New Jersey-style swagger, emphasizing his personality and experience as his key assets. He criticized Washington’s dysfunction and gridlock, positioning himself as a forthright leader capable of making tough decisions. Christie mocked his rivals, particularly senators like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, for lacking state governance experience, and attacked Hillary Clinton for her role in Obama’s weak foreign policy. However, his campaign faces significant challenges: his record includes economic downgrades, job growth stagnation, pension system failures, and scandals. Despite these issues, Christie is banking on his raw charm, wit, and ability to tell difficult truths to stand out in a crowded field. His strategy includes town hall meetings in New Hampshire, but his centrist background and weakened reputation make his path to the nomination difficult. Christie’s campaign hinges on his ability to reinvent himself and convince voters he is the strongest candidate to restore authority and decision-making in the Oval Office. END OF SUMMARY.
