Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Chris Christie declaring his candidacy for president. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by introducing Christie's announcement in Livingston, N.J., where he emphasizes his personality and experience. He's positioning himself as the only Republican candidate who's forthright and capable of leading, especially after his tenure as governor. He criticizes other candidates, like Rubio and Cruz, for not having state governance experience. He also takes shots at Obama and Clinton's foreign policies.

Christie's record as governor isn't stellar—economic issues, pension problems, scandals. His support among Republicans is low, with 55% saying they can't envision voting for him. He's relying on his personality, which includes charm and wit, to build his campaign.

He's planning to focus on New Hampshire, skipping the usual early-state tour, and using town hall meetings as his main strategy. However, he faces tough competition from better-funded and more popular candidates. His campaign has vulnerabilities, especially as a centrist from the Northeast, which is a tough path in the GOP.

In his speech, he used emotional appeals, like talking about his father's background, to connect with the audience. But his speech had some clichés and lacked a script, showing room for improvement.

So, the summary needs to capture his announcement, his strengths (personality, experience), weaknesses (low approval, record issues), his campaign strategy (New Hampshire, town halls), and the challenges he faces in the crowded field. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points without getting bogged down in details.

I'll structure it by starting with his candidacy announcement, his key points, his record, campaign strategy, and the challenges ahead. Make sure to mention his criticism of other candidates and his focus on New Hampshire. Also, highlight his reliance on personality despite his low approval ratings.

Let me draft that, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.
