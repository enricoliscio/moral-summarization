SUMMARY:
The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns, with the ACLU arguing that certain provisions would "unconstitutionally impinge" on free speech rights and "silence necessary voices." Republicans have called the bill a "power grab" that would amount to a federal takeover of elections, while Democrats argue it would "restore the people's faith" in government and give power back to the people. The bill would institute a public financing system for congressional campaigns, require presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and make Election Day a federal holiday. Despite the controversy, the bill is not expected to succeed in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
