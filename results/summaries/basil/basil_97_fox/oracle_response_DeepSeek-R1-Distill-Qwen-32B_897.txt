Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the House of Representatives passing HR 1, an election reform bill, which has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll list those words to make sure I incorporate them: curb, make, bolster, vote, provisions, impinge, harming, silencing, unclear, subjective, lead, speech, voted, pass, fund, micromanage, unnecessary, finance, restores, works, grab, grabs, away, gives.

I'll start by outlining the key points: the bill's goals, the criticisms, and the reactions from both sides. I need to make sure each point uses the appropriate moral terms. For example, HR 1 aims to "curb" big money and "bolster" election security. The ACLU is concerned it "impinges" on free speech, which could "harm" public discourse by "silencing" voices. Republicans see it as a "power grab" and "funding" campaigns, while Democrats argue it "restores" faith in government.

I'll structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll check each sentence to see if it uses the moral terms correctly and flows logically. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens and keep the summary clear and accurate.

SUMMARY: The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill, aimed at curbing big money in politics, making voting easier, and bolstering election security. The bill includes public financing for campaigns, requiring presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and designating Election Day as a federal holiday. Civil libertarians, including the ACLU, criticized the bill for provisions that impinge on free speech, arguing it could harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. The DISCLOSE ACT, requiring organizations to disclose donors, was a particular concern, as it may lead to unclear and subjective standards, reducing speech. Republicans accused the bill of being a Democratic power grab, funding campaigns through taxpayer money, and micromanaging state-run elections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the bill as restoring faith in government working for the people, not special interests. Democrats argued it grabs power away from elites and gives it to the people, while Republicans claimed it undermines election integrity by allowing felons to vote and imposing a one-size-fits-all standard. END OF SUMMARY.
