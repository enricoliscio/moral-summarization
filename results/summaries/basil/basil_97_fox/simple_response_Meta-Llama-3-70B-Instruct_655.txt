SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. The bill institutes public financing for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and makes Election Day a federal holiday. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans, who argue that it unconstitutionally impinges on free speech rights and amounts to a federal takeover of elections. The ACLU has expressed concerns that the bill's provisions, particularly the DISCLOSE ACT, will harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the bill "restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest" and "grabs power away from the elites and gives it to the people." The bill is not expected to succeed in the Senate.
