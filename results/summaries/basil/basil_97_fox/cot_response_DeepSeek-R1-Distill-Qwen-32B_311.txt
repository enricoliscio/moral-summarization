Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about the House approving HR 1, which is a sweeping election reform bill. It's described as the touchstone to the Democratic agenda. Critics, including civil libertarians and Republicans, are concerned about First Amendment issues. The bill aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and improve election security. It includes public financing for campaigns, disclosure of tax returns, and making Election Day a federal holiday.

The ACLU opposes it, saying it impinges on free speech. They mention provisions that silence necessary voices. Republicans call it a power grab, a federal takeover, and micromanagement. They worry about public funding for campaigns, including dinners and politicians. The White House says it's costly and unnecessary. Pelosi defends it as restoring faith in government working for the public, not special interests. McCarthy claims it undermines election integrity by allowing felons to vote and applying a one-size-fits-all standard. Democrats argue it's a mischaracterization and that the funding comes from surcharges, not taxpayers.

So, the morally framed words are: sweeping, touchstone, agenda, criticized, First Amendment, concerns, curb, easier, bolster, public financing, disclosure, federal holiday, approved, dead on arrival, impinge, free speech, silencing, necessary voices, public discourse, DISCLOSE ACT, report spending, TV ads, call, election, defeat, unconstitutionally, unclear, subjective, confusion, less speech, power grab, federal takeover, micromanage, cost, unnecessary, restore, faith, public interest, people's interest, special interests, undermine, integrity, convicted felons, one-size-fits-all, mischaracterization, grab power, elites, power brokers, surcharge, taxpayers.

Now, I need to write a summary using these words. I'll start by mentioning the approval of HR 1, its goals, and the criticisms. I'll include the ACLU's concerns about free speech and the Republicans' view as a power grab. Pelosi's defense and the funding source should be included. I need to keep it under 200 words and preserve the moral framing.

I'll structure it as: House approves HR 1, its aims, criticisms from ACLU on free speech, Republicans calling it a power grab, Pelosi's response, and the funding details. That should cover all the key points with the moral terms intact.
