Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about the House of Representatives passing HR 1, an election reform bill. The bill aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. But it's facing criticism from civil libertarians and Republicans for First Amendment issues.

The user provided a list of morally framed words used by the author. I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these words as possible. Words like "curb," "make," "bolster," "vote," "provisions," "impinge," "harming," "silencing," "unclear," "subjective," "lead," "speech," "voted," "pass," "fund," "micromanage," "unnecessary," "finance," "restores," "works," "grab," "grabs," "away," "gives."

I should start by stating the bill's approval and its main goals. Then, mention the criticisms from the ACLU and Republicans, using the moral words. I need to highlight the concerns about free speech and the DISCLOSE ACT. Also, include the opposing views from Pelosi and McCarthy, using the appropriate terms.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral framing. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point includes the necessary moral language without making it too clunky.

SUMMARY:  
The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill aimed at curbing big money in politics, making voting easier, and bolstering election security. The bill includes provisions like public financing for campaigns, requiring presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and designating Election Day as a federal holiday. However, it has faced criticism from civil libertarians and Republicans over concerns that it impinges on free speech rights. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued that the bill's provisions, particularly the DISCLOSE ACT, could harm public discourse by silencing voices and lead to less speech due to unclear and subjective standards. Republicans accused the bill of being a Democratic power grab, claiming it would micromanage elections and finance campaigns unnecessarily. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the bill, stating it restores faith in government working for the people, not special interests. Democrats, like Rep. Zoe Lofgren, argued it grabs power away from elites and gives it to the people, while Republicans, such as Kevin McCarthy, criticized it for undermining election integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
