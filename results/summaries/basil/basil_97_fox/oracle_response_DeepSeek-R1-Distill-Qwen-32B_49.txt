Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing from the original text. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House passed HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. It includes public financing, tax return disclosure, and making Election Day a federal holiday. However, it's facing criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians over First Amendment concerns, especially regarding the DISCLOSE ACT.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Words like "curb," "make," "bolster," "impinge," "harming," "silencing," "unclear," "subjective," "speech," "fund," "micromanage," "unnecessary," "finance," "restores," "works," "grab," "grabs," "away," "gives" should be included.

I'll start by stating the House approved HR 1, mentioning its goals. Then, I'll note the criticisms from Republicans and the ACLU, focusing on the First Amendment issues and the DISCLOSE ACT. I'll also include Pelosi's defense, emphasizing empowering the people, and the funding source from settlements.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check that all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved through the use of the specified words. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence contributes to the overall summary without being redundant.

SUMMARY: The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill aimed at curbing big money in politics, making voting easier, and bolstering election security. The bill includes public financing for campaigns, tax return disclosure for presidential candidates, and designating Election Day as a federal holiday. However, it faces criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians, who argue it impinges on free speech and harms public discourse by silencing voices. The ACLU warns that the DISCLOSE ACT, requiring organizations to disclose donors, has unclear and subjective standards, potentially leading to less speech. Republicans call the bill a Democratic power grab, claiming it funds campaigns and micromanages elections. Democrats counter that it restores faith in government and gives power to the people, funded by surcharges on federal settlements, not taxpayers. Pelosi defends it as a power grab for the people, while Republicans, like McCarthy, claim it undermines election integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
