SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans, who argue that it infringes on First Amendment rights and amounts to a federal takeover of elections. The ACLU has expressed concerns that the bill's provisions, including the DISCLOSE ACT, will unconstitutionally impinge on free speech rights and silence necessary voices. Republicans have labeled the bill a "power grab" that will allow convicted felons to vote and undermine election integrity. In contrast, Democrats argue that the bill will "grab power away from the elites and the power brokers and give it to the people" by making elections more transparent and accountable to the public interest. The bill's fate is uncertain, as it is unlikely to succeed in the Senate.
