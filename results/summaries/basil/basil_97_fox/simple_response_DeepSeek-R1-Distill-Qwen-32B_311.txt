Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the House passing HR 1, which is a big election reform bill. The Democrats are pushing it, but there's a lot of criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians.

First, I should highlight the main points of HR 1: curbing big money, making voting easier, improving election security, public financing, tax return disclosure, and Election Day as a federal holiday. That's the positive side from the Democrats' perspective.

Now, the criticisms. Republicans see it as a power grab, taking control away from states. They mention the cost and that it's a federal takeover. The White House says it micromanages elections and creates unnecessary programs. I need to note that.

Then, the ACLU is concerned about the First Amendment. They think the DISCLOSE ACT goes too far, requiring too much disclosure and possibly silencing voices. That's a key moral point about free speech.

Also, the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, counters by saying it's a power grab for the people, not the elites. She and other Democrats argue that the funding isn't from taxpayers but from surcharges on settlements. That's an important counterpoint.

I should structure the summary to present both sides: the Democrats' goals and the criticisms from Republicans and the ACLU. Make sure to include the moral arguments each side is making, like the ACLU's concern for free speech and Pelosi's emphasis on public interest.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. Start with the bill passing, outline its main provisions, then the criticisms from Republicans and the ACLU, and end with Pelosi's response. That should cover the moral framing without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill, which aims to limit big money in politics, expand voting access, and enhance election security. The bill includes public financing for campaigns, tax return disclosure for presidential candidates, and designating Election Day as a federal holiday. However, it faces criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians, who argue it infringes on free speech and constitutes a federal overreach. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposes provisions like the DISCLOSE ACT, which mandates donor disclosure for election-related spending, claiming it could silence voices and harm public discourse. Republicans view the bill as a Democratic power grab, criticizing it for federalizing elections and increasing costs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the bill as restoring faith in government by empowering the people, countering claims it undermines state control. The debate highlights tensions over balancing election integrity, free speech, and federal vs. state authority. END OF SUMMARY.
