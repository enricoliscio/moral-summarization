Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow: first, identify the morally framed words, then write a concise summary.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "sweeping," "criticized," "curb," "easier," "bolster," "unconstitutional," "harming," "silencing," "power grab," "takeover," "micromanage," "costly," "unnecessary," "faith," "public interest," "people's interest," "special interests," "mischaracterization," "undermine," "integrity," "elites," "power brokers," "surcharge." These words seem to carry the author's moral stance, so I'll list them each with a *.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll start by mentioning the House passing HR 1, the goals of the bill, and the criticisms from both Republicans and civil libertarians. I'll include the ACLU's concerns about free speech and the DISCLOSE ACT. Then, I'll note the Republican criticism as a power grab and the White House's opposition. Pelosi's defense of the bill and the Democrats' counterarguments about funding and voter integrity should be included. I'll wrap it up by highlighting the ongoing debate over democracy and free speech.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and preserves the moral nuances from the original text.

**SUMMARY:**  
The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill, aimed at curbing big money in politics, easing voting access, and enhancing election security. The bill includes public financing for campaigns, tax return disclosure for presidential candidates, and making Election Day a federal holiday. However, it faces criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians over First Amendment concerns, particularly regarding the DISCLOSE ACT, which mandates donor disclosure for election spending. The ACLU argues the bill unconstitutionally silences free speech, while Republicans label it a Democratic power grab. The White House condemns it as micromanagement of state-run elections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defends the bill as restoring faith in government for the public interest, countering claims it undermines voter integrity. The debate highlights tensions over democracy, free speech, and federal vs. state election control. END OF SUMMARY.
