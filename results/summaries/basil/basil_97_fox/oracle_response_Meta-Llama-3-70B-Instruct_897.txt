SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, aimed at curbing big money in politics, making it easier to vote, and bolstering election security. The bill institutes a public financing system for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and makes Election Day a federal holiday. However, civil libertarians and Republicans have criticized the bill, citing First Amendment concerns and arguing that it would impinge on free speech rights and silence necessary voices. The ACLU has expressed concerns that the bill's provisions, particularly the DISCLOSE ACT, would lead to confusion and less speech. Republicans have labeled the bill a Democratic power grab, claiming it would micromanage elections and fund political campaigns unnecessarily. In contrast, Democrats argue that the bill restores the people's faith in government and grabs power away from elites, giving it to the people. The bill's fate is uncertain, as it is not expected to succeed in the Senate.
