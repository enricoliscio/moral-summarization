SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, aimed at curbing big money in politics, making voting easier, and bolstering election security. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns. The ACLU argues that the bill's provisions, including the DISCLOSE ACT, unconstitutionally impinge on free speech rights and will harm public discourse. Republicans claim the bill is a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections. In contrast, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats argue that the bill "restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest" and "grabs power away from the elites and the power brokers and gives it to the people." The bill's fate is uncertain, as it is not expected to succeed in the Senate.
