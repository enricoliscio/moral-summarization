Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House passed HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. It includes public financing, tax return disclosure, and Election Day as a federal holiday. But it's facing criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians over First Amendment concerns, especially regarding the DISCLOSE ACT. The ACLU is worried it impinges on free speech. Republicans call it a power grab, while Democrats argue it restores faith in government working for the public interest.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with the passage of HR 1, mention its goals, the vote count, and the criticism from both sides. Use the moral words like "curb," "make," "bolster," "provisions," "impinge," "harming," "silencing," "unclear," "subjective," "lead," "speech," "fund," "micromanage," "unnecessary," "finance," "restores," "works," "grab," "gives."

I should make sure each sentence includes these words where appropriate without making it sound forced. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely.

After drafting, I'll check to ensure all key points are included and that the moral framing is maintained. Maybe start with the passage, then the goals, the criticism, the ACLU's stance, Republican opposition, and the Democrats' response. Make sure to include Pelosi's quote about the power grab and the funding source.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary.

SUMMARY:  
The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill aimed at curbing big money in politics, making voting easier, and bolstering election security. The measure, supported by House Democrats, includes public financing for campaigns, requiring presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and designating Election Day as a federal holiday. However, it has faced criticism from Republicans and civil libertarians, who argue that its provisions impinge on free speech and harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposes the bill, particularly its inclusion of the DISCLOSE ACT, which they claim imposes unclear and subjective standards, leading to less speech. Republicans, including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, have labeled the bill a Democratic power grab, claiming it undermines election integrity and applies a one-size-fits-all standard. Democrats counter that the bill restores faith in government working for the public interest, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it a power grab "on behalf of the people." The bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declared it dead on arrival. END OF SUMMARY.
