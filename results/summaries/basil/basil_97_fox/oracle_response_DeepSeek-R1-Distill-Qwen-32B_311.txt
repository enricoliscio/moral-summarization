Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House passed HR 1, which is a big election reform bill. It's part of the Democratic agenda, but it's facing criticism from civil libertarians and Republicans.

The bill aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. It includes public financing for campaigns, requiring tax returns from presidential candidates, and making Election Day a federal holiday. The House approved it 234-193, but it's unlikely to pass in the Senate.

Critics argue it impinges on free speech. The ACLU is worried about the DISCLOSE ACT, saying it's too broad and could silence voices. Republicans see it as a power grab, saying it's a federal takeover. The White House thinks it's micromanaging and unnecessary. Pelosi defends it as restoring faith in government for the people, not special interests. Democrats say it gives power back to the people, while Republicans worry about felons voting and a one-size-fits-all approach.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: curb, make, bolster, vote, provisions, impinge, harming, silencing, unclear, subjective, lead, speech, voted, pass, fund, micromanage, unnecessary, finance, restores, works, grab, grabs, away, gives.

I'll structure the summary to cover the bill's goals, the approval, criticisms from both sides, and the moral arguments each side makes. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill aimed at curbing big money in politics, making voting easier, and bolstering election security. The measure, supported by House Democrats, includes public financing for campaigns, requiring presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and designating Election Day as a federal holiday. However, it faces criticism from civil libertarians and Republicans over provisions they claim impinge on free speech. The ACLU argues the DISCLOSE ACT, which mandates organizations to disclose donors, is unclear and subjective, potentially silencing necessary voices in public discourse. Republicans label the bill a Democratic power grab, claiming it amounts to a federal takeover of elections. The White House accuses the plan of micromanaging elections and establishing unnecessary programs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defends the bill as restoring faith in government working for the people, not special interests. Democrats argue it grabs power away from elites and gives it to the people, while Republicans worry it undermines election integrity by allowing felons to vote and imposing a one-size-fits-all standard. END OF SUMMARY.
