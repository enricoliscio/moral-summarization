SUMMARY:
The House of Representatives approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns, with the ACLU arguing that it unconstitutionally impinges on free speech rights. Republicans called the bill a "power grab" that would "micromanage" elections, while Democrats countered that it "restores the people's faith" in government and gives power to the people, not "special interests." The bill's fate is uncertain, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it's "dead on arrival." END OF SUMMARY.
