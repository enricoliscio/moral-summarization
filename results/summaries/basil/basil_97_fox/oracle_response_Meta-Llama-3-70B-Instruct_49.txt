SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make it easier to vote, and bolster election security. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans, who argue that it impinges on First Amendment rights and will harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. The ACLU has expressed concerns that the bill's provisions are unclear and subjective, leading to confusion and less speech. Republicans have characterized the bill as a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections, allowing convicted felons to vote and applying a one-size-fits-all standard to elections. Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the bill restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest, not special interests, and grabs power away from elites and power brokers, giving it to the people. The bill is not expected to succeed in the Senate.
