SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, known as "HR 1", which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. The bill institutes public financing for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and makes Election Day a federal holiday. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans, who argue that it infringes on First Amendment rights and amounts to a federal takeover of elections. The ACLU has expressed concerns over provisions that could silence necessary voices and harm public discourse. Republicans have also claimed that the bill would allow convicted felons to vote and undermine the integrity of elections. Despite these criticisms, House Democrats argue that the bill "grabs power away from the elites and gives it to the people". The bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it is "dead on arrival".
