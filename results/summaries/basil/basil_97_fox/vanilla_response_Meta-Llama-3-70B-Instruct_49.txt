SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, known as "HR 1", which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. The bill institutes public financing for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and makes Election Day a federal holiday. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans, who argue that it infringes on First Amendment rights and amounts to a federal takeover of elections. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concerns that the bill's provisions could harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. The bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it is "dead on arrival". House Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the bill "restores the people's faith" in government and gives power back to the people.
