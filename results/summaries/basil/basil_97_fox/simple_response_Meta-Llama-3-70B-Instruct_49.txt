SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has approved a sweeping election reform bill, HR 1, which aims to curb big money in politics, make voting easier, and bolster election security. The bill institutes public financing for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns, and makes Election Day a federal holiday. However, the bill has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans, who argue that it unconstitutionally impinges on free speech rights and amounts to a federal takeover of elections. The ACLU has expressed concerns that the bill's provisions, including the DISCLOSE ACT, will harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. Democrats, on the other hand, frame the bill as a "power grab" on behalf of the people, aimed at restoring faith in government and giving power back to the people. The bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate.
