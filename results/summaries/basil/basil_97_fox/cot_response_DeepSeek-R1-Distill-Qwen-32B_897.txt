Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a concise summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. The article is about the House passing HR 1, an election reform bill, which is facing criticism from various groups. The key points are about the bill's goals, the criticisms, and the reactions from different parties.

For STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry a moral connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words that express approval or disapproval. Words like "sweeping," "curb," "bolster," "unconstitutional," "silencing," "power grab," "undermine," "integrity," "mischaracterization," and "elites" stand out as they carry strong moral or evaluative meanings.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping those morally framed words. I should mention the bill's passage, its goals, the criticisms from both Republicans and civil libertarians, and the reactions from Pelosi and McCarthy. I'll make sure to include the key points without exceeding 200 words.

I'll structure the summary to first state the bill's passage and its aims. Then, I'll address the criticisms from the ACLU and Republicans, highlighting the moral terms. Finally, I'll include Pelosi's defense and McCarthy's counterarguments, ensuring the summary flows logically and covers all main points.

I need to be careful to preserve the moral framing by using the identified words and accurately reflecting the opposing viewpoints. This way, the summary remains balanced and informative, capturing the essence of the article while adhering to the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
The House of Representatives approved HR 1, a sweeping election reform bill aimed at curbing big money in politics, bolstering election security, and making voting easier. The bill includes public financing for campaigns, tax return disclosure for presidential candidates, and a federal holiday on Election Day. However, it faces criticism from civil libertarians, who argue it unconstitutionally silences free speech, and Republicans, who label it a Democratic power grab. The ACLU opposes the DISCLOSE ACT, fearing it will harm public discourse by silencing necessary voices. Republicans, including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, claim the bill undermines election integrity and federalizes elections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the bill as restoring faith in government for the people, countering claims itâ€™s a power grab. Democrats argue it empowers the public by reducing elite influence, while Republicans and the White House criticize it as overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
