SUMMARY:
A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her words "hurtful" and "judged." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was "taken aback" by Lauten's criticism of the first family. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, came to the Obama daughters' defense, saying "as First Daughters, you can't win" and that they should be allowed to be themselves. Lauten later apologized for her words, acknowledging that she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." END OF SUMMARY.
