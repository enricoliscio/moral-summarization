SUMMARY:
A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her words "hurtful" and "judged." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was "taken aback" by Lauten's criticism of the First Daughters. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, sympathized with the Obama girls, saying "as First Daughters, you can't win" and that they should strive to be "normal" despite their extraordinary circumstances. Lauten later apologized for her comments, acknowledging that she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager."
