SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a comment on Facebook criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's post, which drew widespread attention and criticism, suggested that the girls showed a lack of class and respect for their position as First Daughters. In response, Lauten issued an apology for her "hurtful" words, but ultimately resigned from her position as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of maintaining privacy and decorum for First Families. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her own words of support and understanding to Sasha and Malia, acknowledging the unique challenges of being a First Daughter.
END OF SUMMARY.
