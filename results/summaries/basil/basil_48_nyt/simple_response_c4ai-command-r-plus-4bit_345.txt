SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon sparked outrage online. Lauten's commentary, which berated the girls for their lack of "class" and "respect," was widely circulated and met with angry responses. She later apologized for her "hurtful" words, but the incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the first family. The episode also drew attention to the challenges faced by first daughters, who are under constant public scrutiny and often criticized for their appearance and behavior. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her support to Sasha and Malia, acknowledging the difficulties of growing up in the public eye.
END OF SUMMARY.
