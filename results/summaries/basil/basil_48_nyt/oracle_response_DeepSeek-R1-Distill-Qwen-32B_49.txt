Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The key morally framed words are saying, respect, words, judged, criticized. I'll make sure to include these.

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, who resigned after a Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters. She told them to show class and dress properly, which led to backlash. She apologized, and her resignation was noted. The White House press secretary was taken aback by the criticism, and Patti Davis shared her own experience of criticism as a first daughter.

I'll structure the summary to highlight her resignation, her critical words, the respect aspect, her judgment, and the criticism she faced. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama’s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, who called on the girls to “show a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect,” faced widespread criticism for her judgment. She later apologized for her “hurtful words,” acknowledging she had “judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.” The incident highlights the risks of using social media to criticize the famous offspring of political figures. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise at the criticism, while Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, empathized with the Obama daughters, noting the challenges of being First Family members. Lauten’s story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of public criticism and the importance of respect in such contexts. END OF SUMMARY.
