SUMMARY: A young Republican aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a comment on social media criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. Lauten's comment, which was widely circulated and criticized, said that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." She also judged them for coming "up short in the 'good role model' department" because of their parents' lack of respect for their positions. Lauten's words drew angry responses and she later apologized for her "hurtful" comments. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of being a First Daughter. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, related an incident where she was criticized for her outfit choice and offered words of support to Sasha and Malia, saying "as First Daughters, you can't win."
END OF SUMMARY.
