Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican congressional aide, who resigned after her Facebook post about the Obama daughters went viral. She criticized their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. She told them to "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." Her post got a lot of attention, leading to her resignation. 

I should include the key details: who she is, her position, the content of her post, the reaction, and the consequences. Also, the article mentions the White House press secretary's reaction and another First Daughter's perspective. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events without too much detail. I'll structure it to start with her resignation, then her post, the reaction, and the outcome. 

I should make sure to mention that she apologized and the broader context of the criticism towards First Family members. 

Let me put this together concisely.
