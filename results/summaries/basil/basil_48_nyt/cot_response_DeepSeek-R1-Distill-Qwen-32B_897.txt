Alright, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions. Let me break this down.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. My tasks are twofold: identify morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "berating," "class," "respect," "cautionary," "dangers," "sniping," "controversy," "condemned," "judged," "apology," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned," "condemned,"
