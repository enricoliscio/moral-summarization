SUMMARY: 
A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a sharp comment on social media about President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia. Lauten criticized the girls for their attire and attitude during the annual White House turkey pardon, suggesting they lacked class and respect for their position. Lauten's comments sparked angry responses and were widely circulated. She eventually apologized for her hurtful words, but the damage was done. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed dismay that a political operative would criticize members of the first family during a Thanksgiving-themed event. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, could relate to the challenges of being a first daughter and offered her support to Sasha and Malia. Lauten's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at public figures, especially innocent teenagers who are already navigating the challenges of growing up in the public eye. Lauten's actions highlight the importance of showing respect, class, and being a good role model, even when one disagrees with others' positions.
