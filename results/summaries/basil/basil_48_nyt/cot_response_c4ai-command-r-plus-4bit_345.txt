SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a comment on social media criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. Lauten's comment, which called for the girls to "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect," sparked outrage and was widely circulated. She later apologized for her "hurtful" words, but the incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the first family. The episode underscores the challenges faced by First Daughters, who are under constant scrutiny and often judged harshly for their appearance and behavior. Despite the innocuous nature of the event, the Obama girls' teenage disdain drew media attention, and Lauten's shameful commentary was a sharp rebuke of their behavior and attire. This incident highlights the moral expectations and challenges faced by those in the public eye, especially the first family.
