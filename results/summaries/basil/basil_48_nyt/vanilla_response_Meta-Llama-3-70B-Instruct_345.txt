SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, 31, wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." The post went viral, sparking widespread outrage and prompting Lauten to apologize for her "hurtful" words. She resigned as communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher of Tennessee. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the children of public figures. White House press secretary Josh Earnest expressed surprise that a political operative would criticize the first family during a Thanksgiving event. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, also weighed in, recalling her own experiences as a first daughter and advising Sasha and Malia that they "can't win" and should focus on being themselves.

END OF SUMMARY.
