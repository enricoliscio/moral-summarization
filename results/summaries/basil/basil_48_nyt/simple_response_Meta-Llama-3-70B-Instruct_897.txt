SUMMARY:

A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, who has a large social media following, wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her out for being judgmental and disrespectful. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, acknowledging that she had judged the girls unfairly. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when directed at the children of public figures. As Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, noted, "As First Daughters, you can't win." The moral of the story is that we should strive to be kind and respectful in our online interactions, especially when it comes to criticizing young people who are still learning and growing.
