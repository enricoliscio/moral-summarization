SUMMARY:
A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." She also implied that they were "coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department." The post sparked widespread outrage, and Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, acknowledging that she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was "taken aback" by the criticism, and Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, sympathized with the Obama girls, noting that "as First Daughters, you can't win."
