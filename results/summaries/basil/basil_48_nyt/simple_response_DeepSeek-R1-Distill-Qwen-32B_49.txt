Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, who resigned after making controversial comments on Facebook about the Obama daughters. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Lauten criticized the girls' attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon, her post went viral, she apologized, and resigned. The moral aspects involve the judgment of teenagers, the impact of social media, and the double standards faced by first daughters.

I should make sure the summary includes her resignation, the nature of her comments, the public reaction, and the broader implications about criticizing public figures' children. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral critique presented in the article.
