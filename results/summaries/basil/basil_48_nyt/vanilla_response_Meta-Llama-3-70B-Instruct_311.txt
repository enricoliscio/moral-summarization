SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, who has over 14,000 Twitter followers, wrote an open letter to the Obama daughters, saying they should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." The post went viral and sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her comments out of line. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, saying she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise that a political operative would criticize the first family's children. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the children of public figures.
