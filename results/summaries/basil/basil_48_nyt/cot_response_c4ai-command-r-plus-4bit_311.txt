SUMMARY: A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a sharp and hurtful message on social media berating President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attire and attitude during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who was a spokeswoman for a little-known congressman from Tennessee, criticized the teens for their "awful teen years" and lack of "class," suggesting they dress like they "deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked angry responses and were widely circulated, eventually leading to her resignation. Lauten's actions serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at public figures, particularly innocent and inoffensive members of the First Family, who are already subject to intense scrutiny and offensive shaming. Lauten eventually apologized for her shameful words, expressing guilt and regret for judging the young ladies in a way she would not have wanted to be judged herself as a teenager. END OF SUMMARY.
