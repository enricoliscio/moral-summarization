SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, 31, wrote an open letter saying the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." The post went viral and sparked a backlash, with many calling her comments hurtful and inappropriate. Lauten later apologized, saying she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the children of public figures. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise that a political operative would criticize the first family's children during a Thanksgiving-themed event.
