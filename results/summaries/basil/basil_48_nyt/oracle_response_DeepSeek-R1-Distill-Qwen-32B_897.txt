Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally framed words: saying, say, respect, words, judged, criticized. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, posted a Facebook comment criticizing the Obama daughters' attire and attitude during the turkey pardon. Her comments went viral, leading to her resignation. She later apologized, and the White House press secretary commented on the incident.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed elements. The article uses words like "criticized," "judged," "respect," and "say." I should ensure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning Lauten's resignation and the reason behind it. Then, I'll note her criticism and how it spread online. Highlighting her apology and the reaction from the White House press secretary adds the moral judgment aspect.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including all the necessary moral elements. I'll structure it to show the sequence of events and the moral implications, such as the criticism leading to her downfall and the broader lesson about social media.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary ends with the specified tokens and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obamaâ€™s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, who described the girls as lacking "class" and "good role models," faced widespread criticism for her comments. She later apologized, acknowledging she had "judged" the teenagers unfairly. The incident highlights the risks of using social media to "criticize" public figures, particularly their children. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise at the aide's "criticism" during a Thanksgiving event. The story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of public "judgment" and the importance of "respect" for the roles of First Family members. END OF SUMMARY.
