SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after posting a comment on Facebook criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's post, which drew widespread attention and criticism, accused the girls of lacking class and respect. She later apologized for her comments but nonetheless stepped down from her position as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring, and Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her own words of support to Sasha and Malia, acknowledging the challenges of being a first daughter.
END OF SUMMARY.
