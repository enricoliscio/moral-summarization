Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are: Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, posted a Facebook comment criticizing Obama's daughters for their attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon. Her post went viral, leading to her resignation. The article also mentions how the girls were bored and the criticism they received, with another First Daughter, Patti Davis, relating to their situation.

I should focus on the moral aspects. The author seems to highlight the unfair scrutiny of First Family children and the consequences of public criticism. I'll need to include Lauten's resignation, the viral nature of her comments, and the broader issue of judging young people in public roles.

I should make sure to mention the social media aspect, the criticism of the girls' behavior, and the supportive message from Patti Davis. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and maintaining the moral message about not judging others harshly.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama’s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, a spokeswoman for Representative Stephen Fincher, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, urging them to “show a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect.” Her comments were widely shared, sparking outrage, and she later apologized for her “hurtful” words. Lauten’s resignation highlights the risks of using social media to critique public figures’ children. The incident also drew parallels to the experiences of other First Family members, like Patti Davis, who shared her own story of facing criticism as a teenager, emphasizing the challenges of being a public figure from a young age. END OF SUMMARY.
