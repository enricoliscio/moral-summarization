SUMMARY:

A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked outrage on social media after she publicly berated President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who has a large following on Twitter, wrote an open letter to the Obama daughters, telling them to "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments were widely circulated and met with angry responses, leading to her resignation as communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed disappointment at Lauten's criticism of the first family. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when directed at the children of public figures. As Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, noted, "As First Daughters, you can't win."
