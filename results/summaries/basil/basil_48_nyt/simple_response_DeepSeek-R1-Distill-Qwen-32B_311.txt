Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, who resigned after making controversial comments on Facebook about the Obama daughters. She criticized their attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon event. Her post went viral, leading to her resignation.

The moral framing here is about the judgment of young people, especially in public roles. The author highlights the double standards and the unfair scrutiny faced by First Family members. They mention how the daughters were criticized for being bored and their outfits, which led to Lauten's backlash. The article also brings in Patti Davis, who faced similar criticism as a First Daughter, emphasizing the unfairness of such judgments.

I should make sure the summary includes these key points: Lauten's resignation, her criticism of the Obama daughters, the viral nature of her post, the moral judgment aspect, and the comparison with Patti Davis. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama’s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, who had over 14,000 Twitter followers, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, urging them to “show a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect.” Her comments sparked widespread outrage, leading to her resignation as communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher. The incident highlights the moral judgment often directed at young people in public roles, particularly First Family members. Lauten later apologized, acknowledging she had “judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.” The story also draws parallels to Patti Davis, Ronald Reagan’s daughter, who faced similar criticism as a First Daughter, underscoring the unfair scrutiny faced by those in prominent roles. END OF SUMMARY.
