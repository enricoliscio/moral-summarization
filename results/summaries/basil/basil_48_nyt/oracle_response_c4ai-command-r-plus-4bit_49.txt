SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon sparked outrage online. Lauten, who described herself as loving "all things pink, green and pearls!," berated the girls for their lack of "class" and respect for their position as First Daughters. She suggested that they "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Lauten's comments were widely circulated and sparked angry responses, leading to her eventual resignation. In her apology, she acknowledged that she had "judged" the girls and used "hurtful" words. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring, and the challenges faced by First Daughters, who are under constant public scrutiny. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, echoed this sentiment, saying that "as First Daughters, you can't win."
END OF SUMMARY.
