SUMMARY: 
Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, sparked outrage online. Lauten's post, which berated the girls for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon, was widely circulated and deemed "hurtful" and "sharp." Lauten's comments were a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the first family, who are often under scrutiny. The Obama daughters' teenage disdain during the event had already drawn media attention, but Lauten's open letter took it a step further. She chastised them for their lack of "class" and "respect," suggesting they "rise to the occasion" and act like "good role models." The backlash was swift and angry, leading Lauten to apologize for her judgmental words. The incident highlighted the challenges faced by first daughters, who are under constant public scrutiny and are often judged harshly for their actions and appearances. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her support to Sasha and Malia, acknowledging that "as First Daughters, you can't win."
