Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the query first. The user provided an article about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, who resigned after making controversial comments on Facebook about the Obama daughters. They want a summary that's concise, under 200 words, and formatted with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll identify the main points. Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, posted a Facebook comment criticizing the Obama daughters' attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon. She resigned after the post went viral. The article mentions her background, the content of her post, the public reaction, and the broader context about the challenges faced by first family children.

I need to keep it brief. I'll start by stating who she is and what she did. Then mention the consequences—her resignation. I should include the content of her post, the viral spread, and the public backlash. Also, noting the apology and the White House's response adds context. Ending with the broader point about first daughters facing criticism ties it all together.

I should avoid including too many details about the event itself, like the specific outfits or the turkey pardon details, unless they're essential. Focus on the key elements: her action, the reaction, and the outcome. Keep the language clear and straightforward.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with her resignation, the reason, her position, the content of her post, the viral spread, the apology, the White House's reaction, and the broader takeaway about first daughters. Make sure each sentence is concise and flows logically.

I need to check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll draft it, then count the words. If it's over, I'll trim unnecessary details. For example, maybe I don't need to mention her Twitter handle or the congressman's name unless it's crucial.

Wait, the user's example response includes some details about her background and the White House's response. I should include those to give a complete summary. Also, mentioning Patti Davis's letter adds context about the ongoing issue of criticism faced by first daughters.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama’s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, who was a spokeswoman for Representative Stephen Fincher, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, urging them to “show a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect.” Her comments sparked widespread outrage, leading to her resignation. Lauten later apologized, acknowledging she had “judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.” The incident highlights the challenges faced by first family children, as noted by Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, who shared her own experiences of criticism as a first daughter. END OF SUMMARY.
