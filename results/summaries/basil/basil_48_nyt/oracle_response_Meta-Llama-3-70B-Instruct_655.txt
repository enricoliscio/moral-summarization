SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten said the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her words sparked a backlash, with many saying she was out of line for judging the teenage girls. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, acknowledging she had judged the girls in a way she wouldn't have wanted to be judged herself as a teenager. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise that a political operative would use the occasion to criticize the first family. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, related to the Obama girls' plight, recalling being criticized for her outfit at a reception for Queen Elizabeth II. She wrote, "As First Daughters, you canâ€™t win... you still can be." Lauten's actions serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring.
