SUMMARY:
A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who has a significant social media presence, wrote an open letter telling the girls to "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her words "hurtful" and "judged." Lauten later apologized, saying she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was "taken aback" by the criticism, and Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, wrote a letter of support to the Obama daughters, saying "as First Daughters, you can't win." Lauten's resignation serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring. END OF SUMMARY.
