SUMMARY: 
A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters during the White House turkey pardon sparked outrage online. Lauten's post, which berated the first daughters for their attitude and outfits, was met with a flood of angry responses. She later apologized for her hurtful words, but the damage was done. Lauten's actions serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media and the potential consequences of careless comments directed at innocent teenagers. Despite the innocuous nature of the event, Lauten's sharp criticism of the first daughters' class and respectfulness drew media attention and caused embarrassment for her employer, Representative Stephen Fincher. In the aftermath, Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered words of support to Sasha and Malia Obama, acknowledging the challenges of being a first daughter and the unfair scrutiny they face. Lauten's story highlights the moral complexities of public life and the potential for shame and regret that can arise from ill-considered social media posts. END OF SUMMARY.
