SUMMARY:

A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's post said the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her words sparked widespread outrage, with many saying she had no right to judge the teenage girls. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, acknowledging that she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise that a political operative would use a Thanksgiving event to criticize the first family. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, sympathized with the Obama girls, recalling how she was once criticized for her outfit at a White House event. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring. END OF SUMMARY.
