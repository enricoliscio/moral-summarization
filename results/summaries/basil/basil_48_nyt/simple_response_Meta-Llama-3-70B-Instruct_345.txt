SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, who has a large social media following, wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked widespread outrage and were deemed "hurtful" by many. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed disappointment that a political operative would criticize the first family during a Thanksgiving event. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when directed at the children of public figures. As Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, noted, "As First Daughters, you can't win." The moral of the story is that children of public figures should be treated with respect and kindness, rather than being subject to harsh criticism.
