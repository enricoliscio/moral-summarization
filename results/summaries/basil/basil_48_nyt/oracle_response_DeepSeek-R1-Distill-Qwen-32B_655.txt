Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally framed words provided: "saying," "say," "respect," "words," "judged," "criticized." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, criticized the Obama daughters on Facebook for their attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon. Her post went viral, leading to her resignation. The article also mentions the media's role in highlighting the girls' boredom and the broader issue of judging public figures' children.

Now, I need to create a concise summary. I'll start by identifying key events: Lauten's post, its impact, her resignation, and the moral implications. I should use the specified moral words to frame the summary. For example, "criticized," "judged," "respect," and "say."

I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll keep each point brief. I'll mention her resignation, the content of her post, the viral spread, the apology, and the broader cautionary tale about social media and judging public figures' children.

I should also include the reactions, like the White House press secretary's response and Patti Davis's perspective, to show the moral judgment aspect. This adds depth to the summary, highlighting how others viewed the situation.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows well, connecting each event logically while emphasizing the moral framing. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick strictly to the article's content and the specified words.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticized President Obama’s daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who had over 14,000 Twitter followers as @DCGopGirl, wrote an open letter saying the girls should “try showing a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.” Her words quickly went viral, leading to widespread criticism and an apology from her, where she admitted to judging the teenagers unfairly. Lauten’s resignation highlights the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when directed at the children of public figures. The incident also sparked broader discussions about the pressures faced by First Family members, with Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, relating to the girls’ experience of being unfairly judged. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise at the criticism directed at the first family during a Thanksgiving event. The episode serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of public judgment and the challenges of being a public figure’s child. END OF SUMMARY.
