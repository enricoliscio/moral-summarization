SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a comment on Facebook criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's comment, which was widely circulated and deemed inappropriate, sparked outrage and was followed by an apology from her. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of being a first daughter, as Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, also experienced. Despite the backlash, Lauten's comment sheds light on the importance of respecting the position and acting as good role models. 

END OF SUMMARY.
