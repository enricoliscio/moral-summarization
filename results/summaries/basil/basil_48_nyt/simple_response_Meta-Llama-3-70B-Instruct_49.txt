SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who has a significant social media presence, wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her out for being judgmental and disrespectful. Even the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed disappointment at Lauten's criticism of the first family. In a subsequent apology, Lauten acknowledged that she had judged the girls harshly, just as she wouldn't have wanted to be judged as a teenager. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when directed at the children of public figures.
