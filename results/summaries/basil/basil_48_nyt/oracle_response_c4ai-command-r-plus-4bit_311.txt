SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a comment on Facebook berating President Obama's daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. Lauten's commentary, which was widely circulated and criticized, said that Sasha and Malia Obama should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." Lauten's words were judged by many as inappropriate and hurtful, and she eventually posted an apology. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of being a First Daughter. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, related an incident where she was criticized for her outfit choice and offered words of support to Sasha and Malia, saying, "As First Daughters, you can't win." The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the power and consequences of words in the public sphere.
