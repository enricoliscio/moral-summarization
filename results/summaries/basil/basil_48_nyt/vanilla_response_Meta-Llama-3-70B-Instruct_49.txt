SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who has over 14,000 Twitter followers, wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." The post went viral, sparking widespread outrage and prompting Lauten to apologize for her "hurtful" words. She eventually resigned as communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the children of public figures. White House press secretary Josh Earnest expressed surprise at the criticism, while Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, wrote a letter of support to the Obama girls, recalling her own experiences as a First Daughter.
