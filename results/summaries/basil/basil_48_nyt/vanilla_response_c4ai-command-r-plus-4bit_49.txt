SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after posting a comment on Facebook criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's comment, which was widely circulated and sparked angry responses, suggested that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words and resigned from her position as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of being a first daughter. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her own perspective on the matter, recalling a similar experience she had as a first daughter.
END OF SUMMARY.
