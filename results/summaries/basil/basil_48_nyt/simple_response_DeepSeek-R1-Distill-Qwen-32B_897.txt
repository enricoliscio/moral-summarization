Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, who criticized the Obama daughters on Facebook, leading to her resignation. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to make sure the summary reflects the ethical implications.

I should start by identifying the main points: who, what, when, where, why. Elizabeth Lauten made a Facebook post criticizing the Obama girls' behavior and outfits during the turkey pardon. She resigned after the post went viral. The moral aspect is about social media's power and the judgment of public figures' children.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me outline the key events: her resignation, the content of her post, the viral reaction, her apology, and the broader implications. I should also mention Josh Earnest's reaction and Patti Davis's perspective to add depth.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, ensuring it's concise but covers all important aspects. I'll make sure to highlight the moral lesson about social media and judging others, as that's crucial for the user's request.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obamaâ€™s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, who described herself as a conservative and former Republican National Committee aide, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, urging them to "show a little class" and dress more respectfully. Her post, which accused the girls of failing to act as good role models, sparked widespread outrage and criticism. Lauten later apologized, acknowledging she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." Her resignation highlights the risks of using social media to critique public figures' children. The incident also drew parallels to other First Daughters, like Patti Davis, who noted the challenges of living in the public eye. END OF SUMMARY.
