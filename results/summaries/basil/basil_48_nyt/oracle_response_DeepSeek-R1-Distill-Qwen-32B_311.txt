Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided: saying, say, respect, words, judged, criticized. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, made a Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters for their attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon. This led to her resignation. The article also mentions the public reaction and the broader context of social media criticism.

Next, I need to identify the key moral elements. The words "say," "respect," "judged," and "criticized" are central. I should ensure these words are included in the summary. 

I'll start by mentioning Lauten's resignation and her Facebook post. I'll use "say" when referring to her comments. Highlighting her criticism and judgment of the girls is important. I should also note the public reaction and the apology, using "judged" and "criticized" where appropriate.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll include the consequences of her actions, the White House's response, and the comparison to Patti Davis's experience to show the broader issue of public scrutiny.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the resignation, the reason, the reaction, the apology, and the implications. I'll make sure to include all the required moral terms without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticized President Obamaâ€™s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who described the girls as lacking "class" and "good role models," faced widespread criticism for her judgment. She later apologized, acknowledging she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when targeting the children of prominent figures. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise at the criticism directed at the first family during a Thanksgiving event. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, echoed the challenges of being a First Daughter, noting the constant scrutiny and lack of normalcy in their lives. The episode underscores the impact of public judgment and the importance of respect, even in moments of criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
