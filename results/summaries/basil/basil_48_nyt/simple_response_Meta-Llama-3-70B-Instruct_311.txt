SUMMARY:

A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked outrage on social media with a Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten, who has a significant following on Twitter, wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her post was widely circulated and met with angry responses, prompting her to issue an apology for her "hurtful" words. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping, particularly when directed at the children of public figures. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed disappointment at the aide's criticism, while Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, sympathized with the Obama girls, noting that as First Daughters, they can't win. Lauten ultimately resigned from her position as communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher.
