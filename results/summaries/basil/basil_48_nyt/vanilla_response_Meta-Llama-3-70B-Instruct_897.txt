SUMMARY:

A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, who has over 14,000 Twitter followers, wrote an open letter to the girls, saying they should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." The post sparked widespread outrage, with many calling her comments hurtful and inappropriate. Lauten later apologized for her words, saying she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the children of public figures.

END OF SUMMARY.
