Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican aide, who resigned after posting a critical Facebook message about Obama's daughters. 

First, I should identify the key points: Lauten criticized the girls' attitude and outfits during the turkey pardon, her post went viral, she apologized, and she resigned. Also, there's the moral aspect of judging teenagers publicly and the double standards faced by first daughters.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning her resignation, the reason, and the viral nature of her post. Then, I'll include her apology and the broader implications, like the unfair scrutiny of first daughters. 

I should also highlight the contrast between her criticism and the support from Patti Davis, emphasizing the moral lesson about not judging others harshly. Keeping the language clear and sticking to the main points without getting too detailed is important. 

Let me structure it: introduce Lauten and her resignation, describe her Facebook post, the reaction, her apology, and then the moral takeaway. Make sure to keep it within the word limit and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama’s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, who called for the girls to “show a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect,” faced widespread backlash. She later apologized, acknowledging she had “judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.” The incident highlights the moral dilemma of publicly judging teenagers, especially those in the spotlight, and the double standards often applied to first daughters. Lauten’s resignation underscores the risks of social media sniping and the unfair scrutiny faced by young people in high-profile families. END OF SUMMARY.
