SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after her Facebook post berating President Obama's daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon sparked outrage online. Lauten, who had a substantial online following, criticized Sasha and Malia Obama for their "teenage disdain" and suggested they dress with more "class" and "respect." Her comments were met with widespread backlash, and she eventually apologized for her "hurtful" words. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at public figures, especially children, and the importance of maintaining a certain level of respect and class, regardless of political affiliation. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her support to the Obama girls, acknowledging that "as First Daughters, you can't win." This incident serves as a reminder that personal attacks, especially on minors, are unacceptable and that public figures should be held to a higher standard of conduct. END OF SUMMARY.
