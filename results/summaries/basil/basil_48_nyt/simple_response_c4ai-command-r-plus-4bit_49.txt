SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after posting a Facebook comment criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's comment, which was widely circulated and sparked angry responses, criticized the girls for their "lack of class" and suggested they dress in a way that "deserves respect." Lauten's commentary drew attention to the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of being a first daughter. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, related to the Obamas' daughters, recalling her own experience of being criticized for her outfit choice. Lauten's resignation highlights the moral implications of public shaming and the potential consequences of insensitive social media posts.
END OF SUMMARY.
