SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's post said the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her words were widely circulated and sparked a flood of angry responses. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, saying she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was "taken aback" by Lauten's criticism of the first family. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping and the scrutiny faced by the children of public figures. As Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, wrote, "As First Daughters, you canâ€™t win." END OF SUMMARY.
