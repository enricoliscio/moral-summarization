Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican congressional aide, who resigned after making some controversial Facebook comments about the Obama daughters. She criticized their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon event. Her post went viral, leading to her resignation. 

I should start by identifying the main points. Elizabeth Lauten, her position, the content of her Facebook post, the reaction, and the consequences. Also, mention the context of the event and maybe a bit about the public's reaction, including Josh Earnest's comment and Patti Davis's perspective.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should avoid getting into too much detail about the outfits or the event itself, just mention it briefly. 

I'll structure it: introduce Lauten, her resignation, the reason (Facebook post about Obama daughters), the content of the post, the viral spread, her apology, the reactions from Josh Earnest and Patti Davis, and the broader lesson about social media and public scrutiny.

Wait, the article also mentions that Lauten was a spokeswoman for Rep. Stephen Fincher, but he's not central to the summary, so maybe just mention her position as a Republican aide. 

Also, the article talks about the event where the daughters seemed bored, which led to the post. So I should mention that briefly to set the context.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically: who she is, what she did, the reaction, her resignation, and the implications.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll aim for around 150-200 words.

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me look at that. It's structured well, covering all the main points succinctly. I should follow a similar approach but make sure it's my own summary.

I need to make sure I include her resignation, the content of the post, the viral nature, her apology, the reactions, and the broader lesson. 

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in a concise manner.

SUMMARY: A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten, a spokeswoman for Rep. Stephen Fincher, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, urging them to "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect." Her post, which accused the girls of being poor role models, sparked widespread outrage. Lauten later apologized, acknowledging she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." Her resignation highlights the risks of using social media to criticize public figures. The incident drew comparisons to past criticism faced by other first daughters, underscoring the challenges of public scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
