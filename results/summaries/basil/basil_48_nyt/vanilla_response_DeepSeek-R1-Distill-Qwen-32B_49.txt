Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican congressional aide, who resigned after her Facebook post went viral. She criticized President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. She told them to show more class and dress appropriately, which sparked a lot of backlash. She later apologized but still had to resign.

I should highlight the main points: who she is, what she did, the reaction, and the consequences. Also, mention the context of the event and the media attention the girls received.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me make sure I include all key elements without getting too detailed. Maybe also note the comparison to Patti Davis's experience to show it's a common issue for first daughters.

I should structure it in a clear, concise manner, starting with her resignation, the reason, the reaction, and the broader context. Make sure to mention her social media presence and the political implications.

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll put it all together in a summary that's within the word limit.
