SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, sparked outrage online. Lauten's post, which berated the girls for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon, was widely circulated and criticized for its harsh tone. She later apologized for her "hurtful" words, saying she had "judged" the girls unfairly. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the first family and the challenges of being a first daughter, as Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, pointed out in a letter of support to Sasha and Malia. Despite the backlash, Lauten's comments drew attention to the girls' teenage disdain during the event, which had already garnered media attention.

END OF SUMMARY.
