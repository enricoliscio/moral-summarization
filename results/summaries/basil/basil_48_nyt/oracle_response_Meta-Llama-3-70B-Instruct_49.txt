SUMMARY:

A young Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten's post said the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her words sparked a flood of angry responses, with many saying she had no right to judge the teenage girls. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, acknowledging that she had "judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed surprise that a political operative would criticize members of the first family. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping, and the importance of respecting the dignity of others, especially when they are in the public eye.
