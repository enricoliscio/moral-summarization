SUMMARY:
A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten wrote that the girls should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Her comments sparked a flood of angry responses, and she later apologized for her "hurtful" words. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was "taken aback" by Lauten's criticism of the first family. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, defended the Obama girls, saying "as First Daughters, you can't win" and that they should be allowed to be themselves despite the scrutiny. Lauten's resignation serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring. END OF SUMMARY.
