SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after posting a Facebook comment criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon. Lauten's comment, which was widely circulated and sparked angry responses, accused the girls of lacking class and respect. Lauten later apologized for her "hurtful" words, but the incident highlighted the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, related to the Obama girls in a letter, recalling her own experience of being criticized for her outfit choice. Despite the backlash, the incident drew attention to the challenges faced by first daughters, who are constantly under public scrutiny.
END OF SUMMARY.
