SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a young Republican congressional aide, resigned after her Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon went viral. Lauten's commentary, which berated the teens for their lack of "class" and "respect," sparked widespread backlash and led to her eventual resignation. The incident highlights the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country's most famous offspring and the challenges of maintaining privacy and respect for first daughters. Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, offered her own perspective, sympathizing with the Obama girls and acknowledging the unique challenges they face as first daughters. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the power and consequences of social media, as well as a reminder of the importance of respecting the privacy and personal lives of public figures, especially minors.
END OF SUMMARY.
