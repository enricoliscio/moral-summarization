SUMMARY: A Republican congressional aide, Elizabeth Lauten, resigned after facing backlash for a Facebook post criticizing President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, for their attitude and outfits during the White House turkey pardon. Lauten's post, which called for the girls to "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect," sparked widespread outrage and was seen as inappropriate and disrespectful. Lauten later apologized for her comments, but the incident highlighted the dangers of social media sniping directed at the first family. Patti Davis, daughter of former President Ronald Reagan, offered her support to Sasha and Malia, acknowledging the challenges of being a first daughter. The incident also drew attention to the annual turkey pardon event and the Obama daughters' teenage disdain, which had previously been noted by the media.
END OF SUMMARY.
