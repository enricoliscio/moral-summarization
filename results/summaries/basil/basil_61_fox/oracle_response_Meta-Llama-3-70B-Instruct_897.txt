SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has strongly condemned Donald Trump for allegedly spreading false and derogatory information about his wife, Heidi. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that falsely claimed he had extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "garbage." Trump's campaign had also made hits about Heidi's mental health. In response, Cruz said he would not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his family. Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, denied allegations that she was one of the women mentioned in the article, calling it "stupidity on all levels." The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi, prompting Cruz to call him a "coward" for threatening to attack his wife. The personal attacks have escalated, with both sides trading accusations of lies and smear tactics.

END OF SUMMARY.
