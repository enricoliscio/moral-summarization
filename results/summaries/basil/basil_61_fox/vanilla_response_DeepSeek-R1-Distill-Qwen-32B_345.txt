Alright, I need to summarize this article about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article talks about how Ted Cruz is blaming Donald Trump for a National Enquirer story that accused him of extramarital affairs. Cruz is also criticizing Trump for attacking his wife's mental health. This has caused Cruz to back away from supporting Trump if he wins the nomination. He made a statement saying he doesn't support people who attack his family and that Trump won't be the nominee.

Earlier, GOP candidates had promised not to run as independents if not nominated, but Cruz's stance now might change that. Cruz also dismissed the National Enquirer story as a smear campaign orchestrated by Trump. Trump's spokeswoman denied the allegations, calling them false.

The feud started when a super PAC against Trump posted an ad featuring Melania Trump in a past photo, which led Trump to threaten to reveal information about Heidi Cruz. Cruz denied involvement in the ad and called Trump a coward for targeting his wife.

Additionally, an anti-Trump PAC is running ads highlighting Trump's derogatory comments about women. Trump is leading in delegates, so Cruz has a tough battle ahead.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: Cruz's accusations against Trump, the National Enquirer story, the personal attacks on their wives, the super PAC ad, and the implications for the nomination race.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main conflict, then the accusations, the feud's origin, and the current situation with Trump leading and Cruz's challenges.

Let me make sure I include all important elements without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep it concise. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.
