SUMMARY: The Republican presidential race has descended into a war of words, with Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump exchanging attacks over their wives. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it "complete and utter lies" and a "tabloid smear." Cruz also suggested he may not support Trump if he wins the nomination, despite a previous pledge. The feud escalated when an anti-Trump super PAC ran ads featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward." The exchange marks a departure from the usual boundaries of political campaigns. Trump maintains a substantial lead in the delegate race, with Cruz facing an uphill battle to catch up.
END OF SUMMARY.
