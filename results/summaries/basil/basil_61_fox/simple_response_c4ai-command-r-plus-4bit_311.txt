SUMMARY: The bitter feud between Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated, with each candidate attacking the other's wife in a series of increasingly personal and morally bankrupt exchanges. The low road was taken first by Trump, who threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, in retaliation for an ad posted by an anti-Trump super PAC featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife, Melania. Cruz responded by calling Trump a "coward," and blaming him for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz has now backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, stating that he does not support people who attack his family. Trump's substantial lead in the delegate chase and Cruz's increasingly desperate tactics raise questions about the moral compass of the candidates and the state of the Republican Party.
END OF SUMMARY.
