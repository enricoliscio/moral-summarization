SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleges Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz has denied the allegations, calling them "complete and utter lies" and a "tabloid smear." The feud between the two Republican presidential candidates escalated after a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump blamed on Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, prompting Cruz to call Trump a "coward" and say he won't support Trump if he wins the nomination. Cruz had previously pledged to support the GOP nominee, but now says he won't back Trump due to his attacks on his family. The personal attacks have intensified as the GOP nomination contest continues, with Trump holding a substantial lead in delegates.
