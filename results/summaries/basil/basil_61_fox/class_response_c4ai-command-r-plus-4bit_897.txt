SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz has strongly condemned Donald Trump for his involvement in a National Enquirer story that accused Cruz of having extramarital affairs. Cruz accused Trump of being behind the "complete and utter lies" and "tabloid smear." The growing feud between the two Republican presidential candidates escalated further when a super PAC opposing Trump used an ad featuring a naked photo of Trump's wife, Melania. Trump retaliated by threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward" for his attack on his wife and denied involvement in the ad. This personal dispute comes as an anti-Trump super PAC runs an ad featuring women reciting Trump's derogatory comments toward women. Cruz now faces a challenge in trying to catch Trump in the remaining races and may only have a chance at the nomination if the contest goes to the summer convention.
END OF SUMMARY.
