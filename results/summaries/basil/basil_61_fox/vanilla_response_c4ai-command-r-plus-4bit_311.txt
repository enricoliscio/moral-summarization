SUMMARY: The feud between Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated, with Cruz blaming Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz's extramarital affairs. Cruz now says he won't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, despite a previous pledge. Cruz called the article "complete and utter lies" and accused Trump of being behind it. Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson denied being one of the mystery women in the article. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward." The personal attacks come as Trump maintains a substantial lead in the delegate race, with Cruz facing an uphill battle to catch up.
