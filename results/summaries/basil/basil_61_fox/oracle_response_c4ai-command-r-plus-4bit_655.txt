SUMMARY: The Republican presidential race has taken a nasty turn, with Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump exchanging personal attacks and threats. The conflict began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring nude photos of Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz fired back, calling Trump a "coward" and denying involvement in the ad. The National Enquirer then published a story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, which Cruz blamed on Trump. He has since backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his family. Trump's substantial lead in the delegate race and Cruz's difficulty in catching up have only added fuel to the fire. This feud has brought the campaign into personal territory that is usually off-limits, with both candidates engaging in a war of words filled with lies and threats.
END OF SUMMARY.
