SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a growing war of words, with each candidate accusing the other of personal attacks and smear campaigns. Cruz has blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it "complete and utter lies" and "garbage." Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, and his campaign has made hits about her mental health. The feud escalated when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked Melania Trump, which Trump called out as coming from Cruz's campaign. Cruz denied this, calling Trump a "coward" threatening his wife. The increasingly personal attacks come as Trump maintains a substantial lead in the delegate chase for the GOP nomination. Cruz now appears to be backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the nomination, citing the attacks on his family as unacceptable. The moral framing of the article centers around the idea of faithfulness, with Cruz accusing Trump of being unfaithful to the truth and Trump being accused of threatening behavior and attacks on Cruz's wife.
END OF SUMMARY.
