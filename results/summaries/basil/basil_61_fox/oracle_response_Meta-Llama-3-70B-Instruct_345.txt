SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "garbage" filled with "lies". Cruz blamed Trump's campaign for the attack on his family, particularly his wife Heidi, and said he won't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's lack of faithfulness to the party. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump responded by threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, which Cruz called a "cowardly" move. The personal attacks have escalated, with both sides trading blows. Cruz denied any involvement in the ad featuring Melania Trump and called Trump's actions "classless". The morally charged language used by both sides has reached a boiling point, with Trump's campaign accused of using "derogatory" language towards women. END OF SUMMARY.
