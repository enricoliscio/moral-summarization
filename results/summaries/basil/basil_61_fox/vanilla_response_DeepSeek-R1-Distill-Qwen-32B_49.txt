Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's feud. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Okay, the article starts by saying that Ted Cruz is escalating the conflict with Trump over their respective spouses. There's a National Enquirer story claiming Cruz had affairs, which Cruz and Trump's team are both denying. Cruz said he won't support Trump if he's nominated, which is a big deal because they had a prior agreement not to run as independents.

Then, the article mentions the ad with Melania Trump's old photos, which Cruz's super PAC used, and Trump threatening to reveal things about Heidi Cruz. They're both attacking each other's families, which is pretty personal and unusual in politics.

Also, there's another ad from an anti-Trump PAC highlighting his comments about women, and Trump is leading in delegates, so Cruz is struggling to catch up.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. I'll start with the main conflict, the National Enquirer story, Cruz's withdrawal of support, the ad with Melania, Trump's threats, and the delegate situation.

I should make sure to mention both candidates' refutations of the affair claims, the personal attacks, and the implications for the nomination race. Keeping it concise but covering all key points.

Let me structure it: introduce the feud, mention the Enquirer story and denials, Cruz's withdrawal, the ad controversy, Trump's threats, and the delegate status. That should cover the main elements without going over the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the conflict with Donald Trump over personal attacks involving their spouses. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating the National Enquirer's story alleging extramarital affairs, which both Cruz and Trump's team denied. Cruz stated he would not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, breaking a prior pledge. Trump, in turn, threatened to reveal information about Cruz's wife, Heidi. The feud began after a super PAC opposing Trump used a meme-style ad featuring Melania Trump's old photos, which Cruz's team denied involvement in. Trump called Cruz a liar and threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi. Cruz responded by calling Trump a coward. Meanwhile, an anti-Trump PAC released ads highlighting Trump's derogatory comments about women. Trump leads in delegates, leaving Cruz with a challenging path to the nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
