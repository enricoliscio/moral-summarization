SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz has drawn a line in the sand in his escalating war of words with Donald Trump over the Republican presidential candidates' wives. Cruz blamed Trump for the National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs, calling it "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Trump's campaign had earlier attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz said he wouldn't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's "classless" behavior. Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, denied allegations she was involved in the affair, calling it "stupidity on all levels." The feud began when a super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi, which Cruz called a "coward" move. The dispute has entered personal territory, with both sides trading insults and accusations of lying. END OF SUMMARY.
