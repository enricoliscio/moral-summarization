SUMMARY: The war of words between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated, with Cruz now backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the Republican nomination. Cruz blames Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it "complete and utter lies" and a "tabloid smear." The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted ads featuring naked photos of Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward," accusing him of attacking his family. The intensely personal attacks come as the GOP tries to appeal to women, and as Cruz faces a stiff challenge to catch Trump in the delegate race. While Trump maintains a substantial lead, Cruz insists that Trump will not be the Republican nominee.
END OF SUMMARY.
