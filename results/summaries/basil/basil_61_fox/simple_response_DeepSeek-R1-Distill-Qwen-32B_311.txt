Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's feud. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral aspects.

The article starts with Sen. Ted Cruz blaming Trump for the National Enquirer story about extramarital affairs. Cruz is upset because Trump's campaign attacked his wife's mental health. This seems like a personal attack, which is a moral issue because it's attacking family members, not just the candidate.

Cruz is backing away from supporting Trump if he gets the nomination, saying he doesn't support people who attack his family. That's a strong moral stance, emphasizing loyalty and protection of family.

The article mentions that Cruz called the Enquirer story a smear from Trump and his team. Trump's spokeswoman denied the allegations, which is expected, but the moral angle here is about truthfulness and integrity in the media.

Then, the feud started with a super PAC ad using Melania Trump's old photos, which Trump called a low move. He threatened to expose Heidi Cruz, which is another personal attack. Cruz called Trump a coward for threatening his wife, highlighting Trump's lack of class and respect.

The article also mentions an ad campaign against Trump targeting women, which ties into Trump's history of derogatory comments about women. This is a moral issue about respect and gender equality.

Overall, the moral framing here is about the personal attacks on family members, the integrity of the candidates, and the respect towards women. The summary needs to capture these elements without losing the author's perspective on the immorality of the attacks.

I should structure the summary to first mention the feud, then the specific attacks on family, the threats, and the broader implications of respect and integrity. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral aspects.

Let me draft it step by step:

1. Start with the feud between Cruz and Trump.
2. Mention Cruz's accusations about the Enquirer story and Trump's attacks on his wife.
3. Highlight Cruz's decision not to support Trump due to the attacks.
4. Describe Trump's threats and the ad with Melania's photo.
5. Note the broader issue of personal attacks and respect towards women.
6. Conclude with the implications for the campaign.

Make sure each point is concise and flows logically. Also, use the moral language from the article, like "attack my wife," "coward," "classless," etc., to preserve the framing.

I think that covers all the key points and the moral aspects. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: The escalating feud between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has taken a personal and morally charged turn, with both candidates attacking each other's families. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating the National Enquirer's false allegations of extramarital affairs, calling it a smear campaign, while Trump threatened to expose details about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz emphasized his unwillingness to support Trump, citing the attacks on his family as a violation of trust and integrity. The conflict began when a pro-Trump ad used a photo of Melania Trump from a past GQ shoot, prompting Trump to retaliate by threatening Cruz's family. Cruz dismissed the ad as not originating from his campaign and criticized Trump for his cowardly tactics. The feud reflects a broader issue of personal attacks in politics, with critics highlighting the lack of respect for women and families. Cruz's decision to distance himself from Trump underscores a moral stance against such tactics, while Trump's campaign continues to dominate the delegate race, leaving Cruz with a challenging path to the nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
