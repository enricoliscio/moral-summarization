Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the text and the specific morally framed words: affairs, attack, lies, smear, spill, used. I should make sure to include these words in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, focusing on their personal attacks, especially regarding their wives. The National Enquirer published a story about Cruz's alleged affairs, which Cruz and Trump's team denied. Trump's campaign attacked Cruz's wife's mental health, and Cruz responded by backing away from supporting Trump if he wins the nomination.

I need to capture the key events: the Enquirer story, Cruz's denial, Trump's response, the ad with Melania Trump, and the subsequent personal attacks. I should use the morally framed words where appropriate.

I'll start by mentioning Cruz's response to the Enquirer story, using "affairs" and "smear." Then, note Trump's campaign attacking Heidi Cruz's mental health, using "attack." Cruz then says he won't support Trump, using "attack" again. Mention the National Enquirer story as "lies" and "smear." Include Trump's threat to "spill the beans" about Heidi, and Cruz's retort about the ad "used" by a super PAC.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating all the necessary moral terms. I'll structure it to show the escalating conflict, the personal attacks, and the implications for the Republican race.

Let me draft this, making sure each moral term is included where relevant. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay concise.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the personal conflict with Donald Trump over attacks on their families. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "complete lies." Trump's campaign had previously attacked Cruz's wife, Heidi, leading Cruz to back away from his pledge to support Trump if he secures the GOP nomination. Cruz stated, "I donâ€™t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump, in turn, threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz after a super PAC used a controversial ad featuring Melania Trump, which Cruz denied "using." The feud highlights the increasingly personal nature of the race, with Cruz calling Trump a "coward" for targeting his family. Cruz also dismissed the Enquirer story as "garbage," while Trump's spokeswoman dismissed the claims as "stupidity on all levels." The conflict underscores the toxic tone of the Republican primary, with Cruz struggling to catch Trump in the delegate count. END OF SUMMARY.
