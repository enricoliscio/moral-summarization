Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the feud between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, involving their wives and some allegations. The user provided a list of morally framed words: affairs, attack, lies, smear, spill, used. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Cruz accused Trump of leaking the National Enquirer story about his alleged affairs. Trump's campaign attacked Heidi Cruz's mental health. Cruz then said he wouldn't support Trump if he's nominated. They both called each other liars and accused each other of attacking their families. There's also the ad with Melania Trump, which Trump linked back to Cruz, leading to more personal attacks.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the growing feud, Cruz blaming Trump for the affair allegations. Then, Trump's campaign attacking Heidi, leading Cruz to withdraw support. Include the lies and smear from Cruz about the article. Trump's threat to spill beans about Heidi. The ad with Melania, which Cruz denied involvement in. Both candidates using morally charged words like attack, lies, smear, spill, used. Highlight how the feud is getting personal, affecting the campaign dynamics.

I should make sure to include all the specified moral words without making it too wordy. Keep it concise but comprehensive, ensuring the summary captures the essence of the conflict and the moral language used.

SUMMARY:  
The escalating feud between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has taken a personal and morally charged turn. Cruz accused Trump of leaking a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "complete and utter lies." Trump's campaign had previously attacked Cruz's wife, Heidi, leading Cruz to withdraw his pledge of support for Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. Cruz emphasized, "I don’t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump, in turn, threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz, further intensifying the conflict. The feud began after a super PAC opposing Trump released an ad featuring Melania Trump in a risqué photo, which Trump linked to Cruz, calling him a "liar." Cruz denied involvement, calling Trump a "coward" for threatening his family. The personal attacks, including accusations of "lying" and "smearing," highlight the toxic nature of the race, as both candidates resort to attacking each other's families. The moral framing underscores the intensity of the rivalry and its impact on the campaign.  
END OF SUMMARY.
