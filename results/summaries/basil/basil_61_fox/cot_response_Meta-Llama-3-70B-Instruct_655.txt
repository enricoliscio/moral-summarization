SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling the story "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Cruz has also backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his wife and family as the reason. Trump's campaign had earlier attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward" for threatening to "spill the beans" about his wife. The personal feud between the two candidates began when a super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump has a substantial lead in the delegate chase, but Cruz may still have a shot at the nomination if the contest spills into the summer convention. The intense personal attacks have marked a new low in the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
