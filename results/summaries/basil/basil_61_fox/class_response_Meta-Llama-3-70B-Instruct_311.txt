SUMMARY:

The war of words between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated, with Cruz accusing Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz called the story "complete and utter lies" and a "tabloid smear" orchestrated by Trump and his "henchmen." Trump's campaign had previously attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz has now backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz, which Cruz called a "cowardly" attack. The moral tone of the exchange has turned ugly, with both sides trading accusations of lies, attacks, and smears. END OF SUMMARY.
