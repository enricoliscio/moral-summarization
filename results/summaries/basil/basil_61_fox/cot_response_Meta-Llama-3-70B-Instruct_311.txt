SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling the article "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Cruz also blamed Trump's campaign for attacking his wife's mental health. In response, Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, which Cruz called a "coward" move. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Cruz denied any involvement and called Trump "classless" for threatening to attack his wife. The senator also hinted that he might not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his family. The intense personal feud has escalated as the two candidates battle for the Republican nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
