SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a "tabloid smear" against him, alleging that the National Enquirer story about his extramarital affairs is a "complete and utter lie". Cruz blamed Trump for the article, calling it a "garbage" attack on his family. The Texas lawmaker also appeared to backtrack on his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family". The feud between the two candidates escalated after a super PAC opposed to Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi, which Cruz called a "cowardly" attack. The personal attacks have marked a new low in the campaign, with both sides engaging in a "war of words" that has gotten increasingly ugly. END OF SUMMARY.
