SUMMARY:
A moral war of words has erupted between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump over their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for an article alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs and now refuses to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, despite his previous pledge. Cruz called the article "garbage," "complete and utter lies," and a "smear." He also accused Trump of being a "coward" for threatening his wife, Heidi Cruz. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife. Cruz fired back, defending his wife and calling Trump "classless." The dispute has crossed into personal territory, with derogatory comments and threats that are normally off-limits in campaigns. Trump maintains a substantial lead in the delegate race, leaving Cruz with a challenging path to the nomination. 

END OF SUMMARY.
