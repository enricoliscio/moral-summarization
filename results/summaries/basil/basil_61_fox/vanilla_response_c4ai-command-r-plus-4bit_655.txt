SUMMARY: The Republican presidential race took a nasty turn as Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump exchanged heated words over their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz's extramarital affairs, while Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz denied any involvement in an ad by an anti-Trump super PAC featuring a naked photo of Trump's wife, Melania. Cruz called Trump a "coward," and said he won't support Trump if he wins the nomination. Trump's spokeswoman denied the affair allegations, and the National Enquirer endorsed Trump earlier this year. The feud escalated as an anti-Trump super PAC ran an ad featuring women reciting Trump's derogatory comments towards women. Trump maintains a lead in the delegate race, with Cruz facing an uphill battle to secure the nomination.
END OF SUMMARY.
