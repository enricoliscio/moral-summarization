SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a bitter feud that has escalated to personal attacks and threats. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that *alleged* he had extramarital *affairs*, and Trump's campaign made comments about Cruz's wife's mental health. Cruz is now *backing away* from his *pledge* to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, stating that he doesn't support those who *attack* his family. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked Melania Trump, to which Trump responded by *threatening* to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife. Cruz called Trump a "*liar*" and a "*coward*" and accused him of being "*classless*." The situation has led to a *stiff challenge* for Cruz as he tries to catch up with Trump's *substantial lead* in the delegate race.
END OF SUMMARY.
