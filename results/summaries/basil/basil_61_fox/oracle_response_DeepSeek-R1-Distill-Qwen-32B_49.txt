Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral words used.

The article is about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump during the Republican primary. It starts with Cruz blaming Trump for a National Enquirer story that accused him of extramarital affairs. The moral words here are "extramarital" and "affairs." Cruz is upset, saying it's a smear and lies, so I should include "smear" and "lies."

Then, Trump's campaign attacked Heidi Cruz's mental health, which is an "attack." Cruz responds by saying he doesn't support people who attack his family, using "attack" again. He also says Trump won't be the nominee, and mentions a promise GOP candidates made to stay faithful, so "faithful" is another moral word.

The article mentions the National Enquirer story is garbage and lies, so I should include "garbage" and "lies." Trump's spokeswoman calls the story false, so "false" is important. There's also the part where Trump threatens to spill the beans about Heidi, which is "threatening."

The feud started with a super PAC using a meme-style ad with Melania Trump's old photo, which Trump saw as an attack. Cruz denies involvement and calls Trump a coward for threatening his wife, using "coward" and "attack."

Additionally, there's an ad by an anti-Trump PAC showing women reciting Trump's derogatory comments, so "derogatory" is another moral word. Trump leads in delegates, and Cruz is struggling.

I need to make sure to include all these moral words: extramarital, attack, faithful, garbage, lies, affairs, smear, false, threatening, used, derogatory. I'll structure the summary to cover the main points, the accusations, the personal attacks, and the political implications, making sure to highlight the moral framing throughout.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each key point and moral word is included without exceeding 200 words. I'll start with Cruz's response to the affair allegations, mention the attack on his wife, Trump's threats, the origins of the feud, and the broader context of the campaign dynamics.
