Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a sample summary, but I should create a new one. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points and the moral words used.

The article is about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump during the Republican primary. Cruz accuses Trump of leaking a story about extramarital affairs, and Trump's campaign attacks Cruz's wife's mental health. Cruz threatens to not support Trump if he wins the nomination, breaking a previous promise. The article mentions morally charged words like extramarital, attack, faithful, garbage, lies, affairs, smear, false, threatening, used, and derogatory.

I need to include these words in the summary. I should focus on the personal attacks, the lies, the threats, and the breaking of promises. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the moral framing.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Cruz accuses Trump of leaking a false story about affairs, Trump's campaign attacks Heidi Cruz's mental health, Cruz threatens not to support Trump, and the ongoing personal attacks between them. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the right moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the conflict with Donald Trump over personal attacks in the Republican primary race. Cruz accused Trump of leaking a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "complete lies." Trump's campaign had previously attacked Cruz's wife's mental health, prompting Cruz to threaten not to support Trump if he wins the nomination, breaking a prior pledge. Cruz emphasized his unwillingness to back someone who attacks his family, stating Trump "is not going to be the Republican nominee." Trump responded by threatening to reveal details about Cruz's wife, Heidi, while Cruz called Trump a "coward." The feud intensified with ads featuring Melania Trump's past photos, leading to mutual accusations of lying and threats. Cruz's campaign denied involvement in the ads, and Trump's spokeswoman dismissed the affair allegations as "100% false." The clash highlights the personal and derogatory nature of the race, with Trump leading in delegates as Cruz faces a tough challenge. END OF SUMMARY.
