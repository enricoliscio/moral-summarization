SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a "tabloid smear" against him, alleging that Trump is behind a National Enquirer story claiming Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz called the story "complete and utter lies" and "garbage." The feud escalated when a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi, prompting Cruz to label Trump a "coward" for attacking his family. Cruz has since backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." The intensely personal feud has raised questions about Trump's loyalty to the Republican Party and his treatment of women.

END OF SUMMARY.
