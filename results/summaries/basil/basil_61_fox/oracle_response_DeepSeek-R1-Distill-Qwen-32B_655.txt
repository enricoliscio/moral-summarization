Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I should include. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump during the Republican primary. It mentions Cruz blaming Trump for the National Enquirer story about extramarital affairs, which Cruz denies. Trump's campaign attacked Cruz's wife's mental health, leading Cruz to question his support for Trump. There's also the ad with Melania Trump's photo, which Trump criticized, and the mention of a super PAC running ads with derogatory comments towards women.

I need to highlight the moral issues here. Words like "extramarital affairs," "attacks," "faithful," "lies," "smear," "false," "threatening," and "derogatory" are key. I should structure the summary to show the personal attacks and the ethical implications of their actions.

I'll start by stating the growing conflict, then mention the National Enquirer story and Cruz's denial. Next, I'll include Trump's campaign attacking Heidi Cruz and the impact on Cruz's support. Then, the ad with Melania's photo and Trump's threat. Finally, the super PAC's ad targeting Trump's comments about women. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each moral term is naturally integrated. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
The growing conflict between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has taken a personal and morally charged turn. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating the National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it "garbage" and a "tabloid smear." He also criticized Trump for attacking his wife's mental health, stating he won't support someone who "attacks my family." Cruz even hinted he might not back Trump if he secures the nomination, breaking from earlier pledges. Trump's campaign fired back, with spokeswoman Katrina Pierson dismissing the affair allegations as "false" and "stupidity on all levels." The feud escalated when a super PAC supporting Cruz released an ad featuring a nude photo of Melania Trump from a past GQ shoot. Trump responded by threatening to reveal "beans" about Heidi Cruz, labeling Cruz a "liar." Cruz accused Trump of cowardice for targeting his wife. Meanwhile, an anti-Trump super PAC released ads featuring women reciting Trump's derogatory comments about women. The race remains tight, with Trump leading in delegates as Cruz faces a stiff challenge.  
END OF SUMMARY.
