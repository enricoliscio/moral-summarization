Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user mentioned specific words like "affairs," "attack," "lies," "smear," "spill," and "used." I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump during the Republican primaries. The article mentions the National Enquirer story about Cruz's alleged affairs, which Cruz and Trump's team deny. There's also the ad featuring Melania Trump, which Trump accused Cruz of using, leading to personal attacks between them.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The words "affairs" and "attack" are central to the conflict. Cruz accuses Trump of lying and smearing his reputation. Trump threatens to spill information about Cruz's wife, Heidi. The ad was used by a super PAC, not Cruz's campaign, but Trump still blames Cruz.

I should structure the summary to include these elements: the affair allegations, attacks on each other's families, the use of the ad, and the smear tactics. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me start by stating the feud between Cruz and Trump. Then mention the National Enquirer story and Cruz's denial. Include Trump's threat to spill beans about Heidi. Note the ad with Melania, clarify it wasn't Cruz's campaign, and Trump's accusations. End with the personal nature of the attacks, referencing the smear and lies.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the morally framed words. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have escalated their feud, with Cruz accusing Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz's extramarital affairs, which Cruz calls "lies" and a "smear." Cruz also criticized Trump for attacking his wife and family, stating he won't support Trump if he wins the nomination. Trump, meanwhile, threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC used a meme-style ad featuring Melania Trump, which Trump claimed was Cruz's doing. Cruz denied involvement, calling Trump a "coward" for targeting his family. The personal attacks highlight the intense rivalry, with Cruz rejecting Trump's tactics and Trump dismissing the affair allegations as "garbage." The feud reflects the increasingly toxic nature of the GOP race, as both candidates resort to attacking each other's families and reputations. END OF SUMMARY.
