SUMMARY:

The war of words between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated, with Cruz blaming Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs. Trump's campaign had also attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz has now backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's personal attacks on his family. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz, prompting Cruz to call him a "coward" and accuse him of being classless. The moral low ground taken by Trump and his campaign is evident in their willingness to engage in personal attacks and smear tactics. Cruz's refusal to support Trump if he wins the nomination is a principled stand against such behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
