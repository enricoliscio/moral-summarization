SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz has denied the allegations, calling them "complete and utter lies" and a "tabloid smear." The feud between the two Republican presidential candidates began when a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump blamed on Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, prompting Cruz to call Trump a "coward." Cruz has now said he may not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his wife and family. Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, has denied being one of the women mentioned in the National Enquirer article. The personal attacks have intensified as Trump leads in the delegate chase, with Cruz facing a tough challenge to catch up.
