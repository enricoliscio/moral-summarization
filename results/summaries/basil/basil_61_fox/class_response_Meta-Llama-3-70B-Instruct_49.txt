SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a "tabloid smear" against him, alleging that Cruz has had extramarital "affairs". Cruz blamed Trump for the National Enquirer story, calling it "garbage, complete and utter lies". Trump's campaign had previously attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz has now threatened to back away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family". The feud began when a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump then threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, which Cruz called a "cowardly" move. The morally charged language used in the article highlights the personal and vicious nature of the attacks between the two candidates.

END OF SUMMARY.
