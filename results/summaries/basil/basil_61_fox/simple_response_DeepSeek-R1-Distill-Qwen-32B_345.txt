Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's feud. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Cruz is accusing Trump of spreading false stories about his affairs, and Trump is attacking Cruz's wife's mental health. There's also mention of ads involving Melania Trump and Heidi Cruz. The moral aspect here is about the integrity of the candidates and the respect towards their families.

I should highlight the personal attacks and the breakdown of decorum in the campaign. It's important to mention the National Enquirer story and the super PAC ads. Also, note the consequences for the Republican Party and the candidates' reputations.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by outlining the accusations, the response from both sides, the impact on their support, and the overall implications on the campaign's integrity.

Let me make sure to include that Cruz is backing away from supporting Trump and Trump's threats against Heidi. Also, mention the super PAC's role in the ads and the moral implications of targeting family members.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by stating that the feud reflects poorly on both candidates and the campaign's standards.

SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the conflict with Donald Trump over attacks on their respective families, accusing Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs. Cruz also criticized Trump for targeting his wife's mental health, stating he won't support Trump if he wins the nomination. Trump, meanwhile, threatened to reveal information about Cruz's wife, Heidi. The feud intensified after a super PAC opposing Trump released an ad featuring Melania Trump in a risqu√© photo, which Trump condemned as a personal attack. Cruz denied involvement in the ad and accused Trump of cowardice for targeting his family. Both candidates have accused each other of lying and spreading falsehoods, with Cruz calling the Enquirer story "garbage" and Trump dismissing it as fake. The escalating personal attacks reflect a breakdown of campaign decorum, raising concerns about the integrity of the GOP race and its impact on the party's image. END OF SUMMARY.
