Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Ted Cruz is blaming Donald Trump for the National Enquirer story that accused him of extramarital affairs. Cruz is upset because Trump's campaign attacked his wife's mental health, and now Cruz is backing away from supporting Trump if he gets the nomination. He said he doesn't support people who attack his family. 

There's also mention of the article being a smear from Trump's people. Trump's spokeswoman denied the claims, calling them false. The feud started when a super PAC supporting Cruz used an old photo of Melania Trump from a magazine, which Trump responded to by threatening to reveal things about Heidi Cruz. Cruz called Trump a coward for targeting his wife.

The article also mentions that this personal attack is unusual in campaigns and that Trump is leading in delegates. Cruz is struggling to catch up and might only have a chance if the convention is contested.

So, the moral framing here is about the personal attacks and the integrity of the candidates. The author seems to be criticizing the use of personal attacks against family members, highlighting that it's beneath the candidates and not about policy. The summary needs to capture that moral aspect, emphasizing the low blows and the impact on the campaign's integrity.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: Cruz blaming Trump for the affair allegations, Trump's campaign attacking Heidi Cruz, Cruz backing away from supporting Trump, the origin of the feud with the ad, and the implications for the campaign. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral elements are clear.

Let me make sure I include all the key elements without going into too much detail. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. I'll start by outlining the main events and then tie in the moral implications about the candidates' behavior towards their families and the overall campaign integrity.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated tensions with Donald Trump over personal attacks involving their families. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a smear campaign. Trump's campaign had previously criticized Cruz's wife's mental health, leading Cruz to distance himself from supporting Trump if he wins the nomination. Cruz emphasized his unwillingness to support those who attack his family. The feud began when a super PAC linked to Cruz used an old photo of Melania Trump, prompting Trump to threaten to reveal details about Heidi Cruz. Cruz dismissed the ad as not from his campaign and accused Trump of cowardice for targeting his wife. The article highlights the personal nature of the conflict, suggesting it reflects poorly on the candidates' integrity and the campaign's focus on family attacks rather than policy. Trump leads in delegates, leaving Cruz with a tough path to the nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
