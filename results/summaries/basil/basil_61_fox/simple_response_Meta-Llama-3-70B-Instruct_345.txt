SUMMARY:

In a heated exchange, Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have engaged in a war of words over their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs, and Trump's campaign retaliated by questioning the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz condemned the attacks, saying he wouldn't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his family. Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, denied allegations that she was one of the women mentioned in the article. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, prompting Cruz to call him a "coward." The exchange has crossed into personal territory, normally off-limits in campaigns, and raises questions about the candidates' character and respect for their families.

END OF SUMMARY.
