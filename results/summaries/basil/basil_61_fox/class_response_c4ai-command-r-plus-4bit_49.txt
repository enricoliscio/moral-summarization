SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a bitter feud that has escalated to personal attacks and the involvement of their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story accusing him of extramarital affairs, which Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, denied. The conflict began when an anti-Trump super PAC ran ads featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, prompting Trump to threaten to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz retaliated by calling Trump a "coward," and the exchange has led to a war of words. The feud has crossed moral boundaries, with Cruz accusing Trump of lying and orchestrating a tabloid smear campaign. The candidates' wives have become pawns in this political battle, and Cruz has questioned Trump's integrity and faithfulness to the Republican Party. The delegate race for the GOP nomination remains heated, with Trump in the lead and Cruz facing an uphill battle. This dispute highlights the candidates' willingness to resort to personal attacks and question each other's morality in the pursuit of political gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
