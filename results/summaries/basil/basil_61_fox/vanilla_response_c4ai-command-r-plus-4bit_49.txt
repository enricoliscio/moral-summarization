SUMMARY: The Republican presidential race has taken an ugly turn, with Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump exchanging blows over their wives. Cruz accused Trump of planting a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, while Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi after an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked Melania Trump. Cruz called Trump a "coward" and denied involvement in the ad, while Trump's spokeswoman denied involvement in the National Enquirer story. The feud has escalated, with Cruz backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the nomination. Cruz called the allegations against him "complete and utter lies" and said Trump would not be the Republican nominee. The conflict has plunged into personal territory, with super PACs also getting involved. Trump maintains a substantial delegate lead, but Cruz is still challenging him in the remaining races.
END OF SUMMARY.
