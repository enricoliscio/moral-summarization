SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a "tabloid smear" against him, alleging that the National Enquirer story about his extramarital affairs is a "complete and utter lie". Cruz blames Trump and his "henchmen" for the attack on his family, including his wife Heidi. The feud began when a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign falsely attributed to Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz, which Cruz called a "cowardly" attack. Cruz has since backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family". Trump's spokeswoman Katrina Pierson denied allegations that she was one of the women referred to in the National Enquirer article, calling it "stupidity on all levels". The intensely personal feud has raised questions about Trump's loyalty to the Republican Party and his treatment of women.
