SUMMARY: Senator Ted Cruz has strongly condemned Donald Trump's involvement in a recent National Enquirer article alleging Cruz's extramarital affairs, stating that he does not support those who attack his family. He accuses Trump of being behind the article and distances himself from his previous pledge to support Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee. Cruz calls the article a "tabloid smear" and reaffirms his stance against Trump's threats towards his wife, Heidi Cruz. The feud escalated when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, to which Trump responded by threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife. The personal attacks have led to a war of words between the two candidates, with Cruz now questioning Trump's character and morality. The situation reflects the increasingly negative tone of the campaign, with Cruz facing an uphill battle to catch up with Trump in the delegate race.
END OF SUMMARY.
