Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump during the Republican primaries. It mentions that Cruz is upset about a National Enquirer story that accused him of affairs, and he's blaming Trump for it. Trump's campaign has been attacking Cruz's wife's mental health, which made Cruz reconsider supporting Trump if he wins the nomination.

I should note the key points: Cruz's accusations against Trump, the National Enquirer story, Trump's response, the super PAC ad involving Melania Trump, and the personal attacks between the two candidates. Also, the article mentions that Trump is leading in delegates, making it tough for Cruz to catch up.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements without going into too much detail. I should structure it to show the escalating tensions and the personal nature of their feud.

Let me make sure to include that Cruz is backing away from supporting Trump, the false allegations, and the ad that led to Trump threatening to expose Heidi Cruz. Also, mention the super PAC's role and the overall delegate situation.

I should avoid any markdown and just write a clear, factual summary. I'll start by stating that Cruz is escalating the feud, then mention the National Enquirer story and his accusations. Then, touch on Trump's response and the ad situation, ending with the delegate lead and Cruz's challenges.

I think that covers all the main points. Let me put it all together in a coherent way, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the feud with Donald Trump over personal attacks on their respective families. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating the National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear." He also criticized Trump for attacking his wife's mental health, stating he wouldn't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. Trump's campaign denied the affair allegations, with spokeswoman Katrina Pierson dismissing the claims as "stupidity on all levels." The feud began when a super PAC opposing Trump released an ad featuring a nude photo of Melania Trump from a past GQ shoot. Trump responded by threatening to expose details about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz denied involvement in the ad and called Trump a "coward" for targeting his family. Trump leads in the delegate count, leaving Cruz with a tough path to the nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
