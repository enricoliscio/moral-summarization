Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about their personal attacks, with Cruz accusing Trump of leaking a story about affairs and Trump threatening to reveal info about Heidi Cruz. 

I should note that Cruz is backing away from supporting Trump if he wins the nomination, which is a significant point. Also, the article mentions the super PAC ad involving Melania Trump and the mutual accusations. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure to include the moral aspects, like the personal attacks and the vows they made. I should highlight how both sides are involved in these low blows, affecting their credibility. 

Let me structure it: start with the main conflict, mention the National Enquirer story, Cruz's withdrawal of support, Trump's threats, the ad by the super PAC, and the implications on their campaigns. I should end with the moral judgment about the attacks harming their integrity. 

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all essential points without getting too detailed. Also, use concise language to stay within the word limit. Double-checking for any important details I might have missed, like the super PAC's role and the impact on their campaigns. 

Alright, time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary that captures the moral framing as per the user's request.

SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the conflict with Donald Trump over personal attacks on their families. Cruz accused Trump of leaking a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear." He also distanced himself from his earlier pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, stating, "I donâ€™t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump, meanwhile, threatened to reveal information about Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC linked to Cruz used a meme-style ad featuring Melania Trump from a past photo shoot. Cruz denied involvement in the ad and accused Trump of cowardice for targeting his wife. The feud highlights the personal nature of the campaign, with both candidates resorting to attacks that many view as beneath the dignity of a presidential race. Trump leads in delegates, leaving Cruz with a tough path to the nomination. The ongoing war of words has raised concerns about the integrity of the campaign, as both candidates have abandoned earlier vows to avoid personal attacks.  
END OF SUMMARY.
