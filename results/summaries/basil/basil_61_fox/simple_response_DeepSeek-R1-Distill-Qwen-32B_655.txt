Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's feud. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the article. So, first, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about how Cruz accused Trump of being behind the National Enquirer story about his affairs. Cruz is distancing himself from supporting Trump if he wins the nomination because Trump attacked his wife. There's also the part where Trump threatened to reveal things about Cruz's wife, Heidi. The moral angle here is about attacking family members and personal integrity in politics.

I should make sure to highlight how both candidates are crossing lines by targeting each other's families, which is a moral issue. Also, the mention of super PAC ads and derogatory comments towards women adds to the moral critique of the campaign tactics.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main points: Cruz's accusations, Trump's threats, the impact on their support, and the moral implications of personal attacks in the campaign. I'll structure it to show the escalating conflict and the ethical concerns involved.

SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the conflict with Donald Trump over personal attacks on their families. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating the National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear." He also criticized Trump for targeting his wife's mental health and vowed not to support Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee. Cruz stated, "I donâ€™t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump, in turn, threatened to reveal information about Cruz's wife, Heidi, calling Cruz a liar. The feud intensified after a super PAC opposing Trump ran ads featuring Melania Trump's past photos, prompting Trump to retaliate. Cruz denied involvement in the ads and labeled Trump a "coward" for threatening his family. The conflict highlights the personal and unethical nature of the campaign, with both candidates crossing boundaries by targeting each other's families. Trump leads in delegates, leaving Cruz with a challenging path to the nomination. The ongoing feud underscores the moral failings of the race, as candidates resort to attacking personal integrity rather than focusing on policy or leadership.  
END OF SUMMARY.
