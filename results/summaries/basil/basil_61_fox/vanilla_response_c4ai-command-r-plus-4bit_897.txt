SUMMARY: The Republican presidential race has taken a nasty turn, with Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump exchanging heated words over their wives. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it "complete and utter lies." He also blamed Trump for attacks on his wife's mental health, suggesting he may no longer support Trump if he wins the nomination. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked Melania Trump, to which Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife. Cruz called Trump a "coward," and the exchange escalated with personal attacks. Trump's spokeswoman denied involvement in the National Enquirer story. The feud highlights the increasingly bitter tone of the Republican race, with Trump holding a substantial delegate lead over Cruz.
END OF SUMMARY.
