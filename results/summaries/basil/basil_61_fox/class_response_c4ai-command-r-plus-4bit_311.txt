SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a bitter feud, with each candidate attacking the other's wife and making threats. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear." Trump, meanwhile, threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC supporting Cruz posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Trump's wife, Melania. Cruz called Trump a "coward" for threatening his wife and denied that the ad came from his campaign. The feud has escalated tensions in the GOP race, with Cruz now backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the nomination. Cruz called the National Enquirer story "complete and utter lies" and accused Trump and his "henchmen" of being behind it. Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson denied the allegations, calling them "stupidity." The growing war of words between the candidates has brought personal attacks and threats into the campaign, marking a low point in the race.
END OF SUMMARY.
