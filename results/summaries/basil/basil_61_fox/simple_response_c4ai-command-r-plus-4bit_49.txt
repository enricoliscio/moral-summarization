SUMMARY: The moral integrity of the Republican presidential campaign has been thrown into question as Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump engage in a war of words, with personal attacks on each other's wives. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, which Trump's campaign has denied. The feud escalated when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward," and the senator now appears to be backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. Trump's substantial lead in the delegate chase and Cruz's challenge in catching up have added fuel to the fire, with both candidates engaging in a battle that has crossed moral boundaries. This incident highlights the importance of maintaining ethical standards, even in the heat of political competition.
END OF SUMMARY.
