SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, which Cruz called "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Cruz also blamed Trump's campaign for "hits" about his wife's mental health. In response, Cruz is backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump's spokeswoman denied allegations that she was one of the women referred to in the article, calling it "stupidity on all levels." The feud began when a super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign called a "smear." Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, which Cruz called a "cowardly" attack. The moral tone of the article highlights the personal and derogatory nature of the attacks, with both sides accusing each other of lies and smear tactics.

END OF SUMMARY.
