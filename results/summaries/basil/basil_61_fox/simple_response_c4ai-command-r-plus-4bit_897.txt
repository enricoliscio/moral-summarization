SUMMARY: The war of words between Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated, with each candidate attacking the other's wife in increasingly personal and morally reprehensible ways. The National Enquirer published a story alleging that Cruz had extramarital affairs, which Cruz blamed on Trump. In response, Cruz suggested he may not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, breaking a previous pledge. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to make her the next First Lady if Trump is elected. Trump retaliated by threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. This marks a morally questionable descent into personal attacks and the use of family members as political pawns. Cruz called Trump a "coward," and denied involvement in the ad, while Trump continues to lead in the delegate chase for the GOP nomination.

END OF SUMMARY.
