SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging that Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz has denied the allegations, calling them "complete and utter lies" and a "tabloid smear." The feud between the two Republican presidential candidates escalated after a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump blamed on Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi, which Cruz called a "cowardly" move. Cruz has now backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his wife and family. The personal attacks have intensified as the GOP nomination contest continues, with Trump holding a substantial lead in delegates. Cruz faces a tough challenge in catching up to Trump in remaining races.

END OF SUMMARY.
