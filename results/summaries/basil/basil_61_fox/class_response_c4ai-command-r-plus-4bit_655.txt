SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz has strongly condemned Donald Trump's attack on his wife, Heidi Cruz, and has denied the National Enquirer's allegations of extramarital affairs, calling them "complete and utter lies." The growing feud between the two Republican presidential candidates has led to a war of words, with Cruz accusing Trump of being behind the National Enquirer story. Cruz has also suggested that he may not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, despite a previous pledge to do so. The intensely personal nature of the feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC ran an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz. Cruz has called Trump a "coward" and accused him of using his wife as a political tool. The moral framing in this article centers around the words "affairs," "attack," "lies," "smear," "spill," and "used," highlighting the unethical and immoral actions of both candidates and their campaigns.
END OF SUMMARY.
