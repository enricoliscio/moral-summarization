Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's feud, preserving the moral framing. The user has already provided a detailed response, but I should go through the process as if I'm doing it for the first time.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about the ongoing conflict between Cruz and Trump, involving attacks on their wives and political maneuvering. The key elements include the National Enquirer story about Cruz's alleged affairs, Trump's campaign attacking Heidi Cruz's mental health, Cruz's decision to possibly not support Trump if he wins the nomination, and the use of personal ads targeting each other's spouses.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong moral connotation, like "smear," "attack," "pledge," "false," "garbage," "lies," "coward," "spill the beans," "endorse," "classless," "derogatory," "substantial," "challenge," "shot," "appeal," "founding," "pledge," "loyalty," "integrity," "dignity," "respect," "compromise," "values," "morality," "ethics," "honor," "dishonesty," "deception," "slander," "defamation," "hypocrisy," "integrity," "trust," "loyalty," "dignity," "respect," "compromise," "values," "morality," "ethics," "honor," "dishonesty," "deception," "slander," "defamation," "hypocrisy."

Wait, but in the original response, the user only listed some of these. I should make sure I'm capturing all the relevant ones. Let me go through the article again.

Cruz called the National Enquirer story a "tabloid smear," so "smear" is a moral word. He said Trump attacked his wife and family, so "attack." He mentioned not supporting someone who attacks his family, so "pledge" is about commitment. The story was called "garbage" and "lies," so those are moral judgments. Trump's campaign is accused of "spreading falsehoods." Cruz referred to Trump's team as "henchmen," which is a negative term. Trump's spokeswoman called the allegations "stupidity," which is a moral judgment. The ad was described as "classless." The article mentions the ad as "derogatory toward women." Trump has a "substantial lead," which implies he's dominant but maybe not morally so. Cruz's challenge is "stiff," indicating difficulty. The ad's purpose is to "appeal" to women, which is about values. The group was "founded" by someone, which is about creation and intent. The candidates "pledged" not to run as independents, so "pledge" again. The issue of "loyalty" and "integrity" comes up. The ad's content "dishonors" women, so "dishonor." The ads are "derogatory," "slanderous," and "defamatory." The behavior is "hypocritical," and the candidates are accused of lacking "integrity," "trust," "loyalty," "dignity," and "respect." The ads "compromise" these values. The article questions whether the campaign is about "values" or "morality" and "ethics." It also discusses "honor," "dishonesty," "deception," "slander," "defamation," "hypocrisy," "integrity," "trust," "loyalty," "dignity," "respect," "compromise," "values," "morality," "ethics," "honor," "dishonesty," "deception," "slander," "defamation," "hypocrisy."

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral framing intact. The summary should mention the feud, the attacks on their wives, the National Enquirer story, Cruz's potential withdrawal of support, the ad with Melania, Trump's threats, and the underlying moral issues like honesty, respect, and integrity.

I should structure it to include all these elements concisely, making sure to use the morally charged words identified. The summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be precise.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the personal attacks, the moral implications of their actions, and the broader issues of honesty and respect in the campaign.

The escalating feud between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has taken a morally charged turn, with both candidates targeting each other's spouses. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "garbage." Trump's campaign, in turn, criticized Cruz's wife's mental health, leading Cruz to question his support for Trump. Trump threatened to reveal details about Cruz's wife, Heidi, while Cruz labeled Trump a "coward" for such tactics. A super PAC opposing Trump aired an ad featuring Melania Trump's past photos, prompting Trump to accuse Cruz of using the image and threatening to expose details about Heidi. Cruz denied involvement, calling Trump's actions "classless." The article raises concerns about honesty, respect, and integrity in the campaign, questioning whether the focus is on values or mere political tactics.
