SUMMARY: Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a heated feud that has escalated to personal attacks and threats. The conflict began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring naked photos of Melania Trump, to which Trump responded by threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz then accused Trump of being responsible for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz's extramarital affairs and distanced himself from his previous pledge to support Trump if he wins the Republican nomination. Cruz called the story "complete and utter lies" and referred to Trump as a "coward." The feud has brought the candidates' wives into the political arena, raising questions about the morality of such personal attacks and the potential consequences for the candidates' campaigns. The incident also highlights the challenges faced by the Republican Party in appealing to women voters and the potential impact of super PACs on the election. Despite Trump's lead in the delegate race, Cruz remains determined to fight for the nomination, even if it means breaking his earlier promise to support Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
