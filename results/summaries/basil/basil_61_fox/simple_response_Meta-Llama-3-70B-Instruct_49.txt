SUMMARY:

In a heated exchange, Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have engaged in a war of words over their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs, and Trump's campaign responded by questioning the mental health of Cruz's wife. Cruz refused to back down, stating he wouldn't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his family. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, prompting Cruz to call him a "coward." The exchange marks a new low in the campaign, with both sides engaging in personal attacks that are normally off-limits. The moral implications are clear: a candidate's family should be off-limits, and engaging in such attacks reveals a lack of character and decency.

END OF SUMMARY.
