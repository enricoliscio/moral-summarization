SUMMARY:

In a heated exchange, Sen. Ted Cruz blamed Donald Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, and Trump's campaign for attacking the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz said he won't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's personal attacks on his family. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" on Heidi Cruz, prompting Cruz to call him a "coward" for targeting his wife. The incident highlights the increasingly personal and nasty tone of the Republican presidential campaign. Trump's campaign has been criticized for its derogatory comments towards women, and Cruz's refusal to support Trump if he wins the nomination raises questions about party unity. The incident also underscores the intense rivalry between the two candidates, with Trump holding a substantial lead in the delegate chase.

END OF SUMMARY.
