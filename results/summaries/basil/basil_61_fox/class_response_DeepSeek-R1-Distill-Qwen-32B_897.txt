SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the conflict with Donald Trump over personal attacks involving their families.

He also criticized Trump for attacking his wife and family, stating he wouldn't support Trump if nominated. Trump, in turn, threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump emerged. Cruz denied involvement in the ad, calling Trump a "coward" for targeting his family. The feud reflects a breakdown of decorum, with both sides using personal attacks to undermine each other, as Trump maintains a lead in the delegate race. END OF SUMMARY.
