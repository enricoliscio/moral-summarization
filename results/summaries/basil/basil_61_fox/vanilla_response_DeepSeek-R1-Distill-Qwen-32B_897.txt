Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a war of words between Cruz and Trump, specifically regarding their wives. Cruz blames Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, which Cruz denies. Trump's campaign attacked Cruz's wife's mental health, and now Cruz is backing away from supporting Trump if he wins the nomination. He said he doesn't support people who attack his family and that Trump won't be the nominee.

There's also mention of a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump's old photos, which angered Trump, leading him to threaten to reveal things about Heidi Cruz. Cruz denied involvement in the ad and called Trump a coward. The article also notes that Trump has a lead in delegates, and Cruz is struggling to catch up.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the feud between Cruz and Trump, the National Enquirer story, Cruz's withdrawal of support, Trump's threats, the super PAC ad, and the delegate situation.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with Cruz's response to the story, then Trump's threats, the ad, and the political implications. I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key events and statements without getting into too much detail.

Let me make sure I cover all the important elements: the article's allegations, Cruz's denial, Trump's threats, the ad's origin, and the political stakes. I should also mention the super PAC involved and the impact on the race for the nomination.

I think that's all. Now I'll put it together in a clear, concise summary.
