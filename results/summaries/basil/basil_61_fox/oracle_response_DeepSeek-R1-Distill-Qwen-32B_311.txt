Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the conflict between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, specifically regarding attacks on their respective spouses. Cruz accuses Trump of spreading lies about extramarital affairs, and Trump threatens to reveal things about Cruz's wife. There's also mention of ads and smear tactics.

I should start by identifying the key events and the moral terms used. Words like "extramarital," "attack," "faithful," "garbage," "lies," "affairs," "smear," "false," "threatening," and "used" are important. I need to weave these into the summary without making it too long.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the accusations, and the personal attacks. I'll mention the National Enquirer story, Cruz's accusations, Trump's threats, and the super PAC ad. I'll also note the moral implications, like the smear tactics and false allegations.

I should ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and flows naturally while including the necessary moral terms. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, making sure the moral framing is clear.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and that the moral words are appropriately included without forcing them. The summary should accurately reflect the article's content and maintain the intended moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
Sen. Ted Cruz has escalated the personal conflict with Donald Trump over attacks on their respective spouses. Cruz accused Trump of orchestrating a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, calling it "garbage" and a "tabloid smear." He also criticized Trump for attacking his wife, Heidi, and vowed not to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, stating, "I don’t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump, in turn, threatened to reveal information about Heidi Cruz, calling Cruz a "liar" and warning, "Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!" Cruz retorted, calling Trump a "coward" for threatening his family. The feud began after a super PAC opposing Trump ran ads featuring Melania Trump in a risqué photo, prompting Trump to lash out at Cruz. Cruz denied involvement in the ad, emphasizing, "The pic of your wife not from us." The conflict highlights the personal attacks and smear tactics dominating the race, with Trump leading in delegates and Cruz facing a tough challenge. Cruz accused the National Enquirer story of being "100% false," while Trump's campaign dismissed the allegations as "stupidity on all levels." The ongoing feud reflects the intense, often derogatory, nature of the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
