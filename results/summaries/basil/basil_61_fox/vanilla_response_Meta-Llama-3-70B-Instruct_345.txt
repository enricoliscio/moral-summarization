SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging that Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz has blamed Trump's campaign for the story and has backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. Cruz stated that he won't support someone who attacks his wife and family. Trump's campaign had previously attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. The feud between the two candidates began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump blamed on Cruz. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz, which Cruz called a cowardly move. The personal attacks have escalated as the GOP nomination race continues, with Cruz facing a stiff challenge to catch up to Trump's delegate lead.

END OF SUMMARY.
