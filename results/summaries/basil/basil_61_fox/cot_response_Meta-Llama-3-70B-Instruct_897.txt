SUMMARY:
In a heated exchange, Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling the article "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Trump's campaign had earlier attacked Cruz's wife, Heidi, prompting Cruz to label Trump a "coward" for threatening to "spill the beans" about her. Cruz also called Trump's actions "classless." The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, prompting Trump to lash out at Cruz on Twitter. Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, denied being one of the women referred to in the National Enquirer article, calling the allegation "stupidity on all levels." The intensely personal feud has led Cruz to question his earlier pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
