SUMMARY: The Republican presidential race has taken a personal turn, with Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump exchanging heated words over their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it "complete and utter lies." He also accused Trump's campaign of attacking his wife's mental health and suggested he may not support Trump if he wins the nomination. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, prompting Trump to threaten retaliation against Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward" and denied involvement in the ad. The exchange marks a departure from traditional campaign norms and highlights the intense delegate battle between the two candidates. While Trump leads in the delegate count, Cruz faces an uphill battle to catch up and may need a contested convention to secure the nomination. END OF SUMMARY.
