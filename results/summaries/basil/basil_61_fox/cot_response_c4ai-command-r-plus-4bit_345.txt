SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a bitter feud that has escalated into personal attacks and threats. The conflict began when an anti-Trump super PAC released an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to expose Heidi Cruz. Cruz called Trump a "coward" and a "liar," accusing him of threatening to attack his wife. Trump retaliated by blaming Cruz for a National Enquirer story alleging extramarital affairs, which Cruz dismissed as "garbage" and a "tabloid smear." Cruz also accused Trump of being behind the story, calling him and his team "henchmen." The intensely personal attacks and threats have brought moral questions into the campaign, with Cruz calling Trump "classless" and backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. The feud has escalated, with both candidates exchanging insults and engaging in a war of words that has shocked many. It remains to be seen if the GOP can repair the damage and unify the party before the general election.
END OF SUMMARY.
