SUMMARY:
Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are engaged in a heated war of words over their wives. Cruz blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs, calling it "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Trump's campaign had previously attacked the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz said he won't support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's "classless" behavior. Trump had threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi, which Cruz called a "coward" move. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump has a substantial lead in the delegate chase, but Cruz is determined to fight on, calling Trump's actions "stupidity on all levels." The personal attacks have reached a new low in the campaign.
END OF SUMMARY.
