SUMMARY: The feud between Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has taken a personal turn, with both candidates attacking each other's wives and making threats. Cruz has blamed Trump for a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, which Trump's campaign has used as a hit against Cruz's wife, Heidi. Cruz has called the story "garbage, complete and utter lies," and a "tabloid smear." Meanwhile, an anti-Trump super PAC has posted ads featuring a naked photo of Trump's wife, Melania, which Trump has threatened to retaliate against by "spilling the beans" about Cruz's wife. The feud has escalated to the point where Cruz is backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, stating that he does not support people who attack his family. The moral framing of the article centers around the words "attack," "lies," "affairs," "smear," "false," and "threatening."
END OF SUMMARY.
