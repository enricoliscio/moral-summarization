SUMMARY:
The Republican presidential campaign has been marred by a war of words between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, with each candidate attacking the other's wife. Cruz accused Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story alleging Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it "garbage" and a "tabloid smear." Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi, to which Cruz responded by calling Trump a "coward." The feud escalated when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked photo of Melania Trump, threatening to make her the next First Lady if Trump is elected. Trump lashed out at Cruz, calling him a liar and threatening to expose Heidi Cruz. The candidates' exchange has crossed moral boundaries, with Cruz backing away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, stating that he doesn't support those who attack his family. The personal attacks and threats have brought a new level of negativity to the campaign, with the candidates engaging in a battle of accusations and insults. 

END OF SUMMARY.
