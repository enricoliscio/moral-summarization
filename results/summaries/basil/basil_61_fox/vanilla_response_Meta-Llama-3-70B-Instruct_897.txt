SUMMARY:

Senator Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs. Cruz blamed Trump's campaign for the story and said he would not support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing attacks on his wife and family. Trump's campaign had previously questioned the mental health of Cruz's wife. The feud between the two candidates escalated after an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, which Cruz called a cowardly move. The personal attacks have become a central issue in the campaign, with both sides trading insults. Trump currently leads in the delegate chase, but Cruz is trying to catch up in remaining races.

END OF SUMMARY.
