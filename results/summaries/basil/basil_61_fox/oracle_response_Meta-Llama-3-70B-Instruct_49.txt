SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of being behind a National Enquirer story that alleged Cruz had extramarital affairs, calling it a "tabloid smear" and "complete and utter lies." Cruz blamed Trump's campaign for the attack on his family, saying "I don't make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family." Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, denied being one of the women referred to in the article, calling the allegation "stupidity on all levels." The feud began when a super PAC opposing Trump posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump's campaign called a "lie" and threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi. Cruz called Trump a "coward" for threatening to attack his wife, saying "if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought." The personal attacks have escalated, with both sides trading accusations of lies and smears.

END OF SUMMARY.
