SUMMARY:

Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Donald Trump of orchestrating a "tabloid smear" against him, alleging that the National Enquirer story about Cruz's extramarital affairs is "garbage" and "complete and utter lies." Cruz blames Trump and his "henchmen" for the attack, which he claims is a desperate attempt to discredit him. The feud began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife Heidi, which Cruz called a "cowardly" attack. Cruz has now backed away from his pledge to support Trump if he wins the nomination, citing Trump's "attacks" on his wife and family. Trump's campaign has a substantial lead in the delegate chase, but Cruz is determined to fight on, accusing Trump of being unfaithful to the Republican Party.

END OF SUMMARY.
