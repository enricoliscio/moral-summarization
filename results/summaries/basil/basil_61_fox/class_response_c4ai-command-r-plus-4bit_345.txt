SUMMARY: Sen. Ted Cruz accuses Donald Trump of attacking his wife and family, blaming him for a tabloid smear alleging extramarital affairs. Cruz calls the story "complete and utter lies" and refuses to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. The feud escalated when an anti-Trump super PAC posted an ad featuring a naked Melania Trump, threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife. Cruz retaliates, calling Trump a "coward." The personal attacks highlight the growing war of words between the candidates, with Cruz challenging Trump's lead in the GOP race.
END OF SUMMARY.
