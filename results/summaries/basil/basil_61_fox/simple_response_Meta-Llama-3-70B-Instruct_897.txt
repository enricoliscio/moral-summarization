SUMMARY:

The feud between Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump has escalated into a personal war of words, with Cruz blaming Trump for a National Enquirer story alleging he had extramarital affairs. Cruz has withdrawn his pledge to support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, citing Trump's attacks on his wife and family. Trump's campaign had previously questioned the mental health of Cruz's wife, Heidi. The dispute began when an anti-Trump super PAC posted a nude photo of Melania Trump, which Trump mistakenly attributed to Cruz's campaign. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" about Heidi Cruz, prompting Cruz to call him a "coward" and accuse him of attacking his family. The moral low ground taken by Trump and his campaign is evident in their willingness to engage in personal attacks and smear tactics. Cruz's refusal to back down and his defense of his family are admirable, but the entire episode is a sad reflection of the state of American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
