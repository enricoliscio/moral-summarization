Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made some controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized Obama's military strategy, calling the Afghanistan war "a war of Obama's choosing." He also compared it to a land war in Afghanistan, which is something history advises against. Steele later clarified that he supports winning the war on terror but still tied it to Obama's decision-making.

The article mentions that the war started under Bush after 9/11, and Obama shifted focus to Afghanistan. Critics, like Kristol, are upset because they see Steele's comments as undermining the party's stance and support for the troops. They want Steele to resign.

I need to make sure to include words like fight, war, choosing, prosecuted, engage, flipping, demonizing, battle, attacks, betting, rooting, taken, security, support, tragedy. Let me see how to weave these into the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by stating Steele's criticism, using "war" and "choosing." Then mention his argument that it's Obama's war, using "prosecuted." Include the historical reference with "flipping" and "demonizing." Then note his clarification about supporting the troops and the war, using "security" and "support." Finally, mention the criticism from Kristol and others, using "betting" and "rooting," and the context of 9/11 as "tragedy."

I should keep each sentence concise, ensuring the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll structure it to flow logically from his remarks, the context of the war, his clarification, and the resulting criticism.

Let me draft that out, making sure to include all the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Okay, I think that's a solid plan for the summary.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced criticism and calls for resignation after declaring at a party fundraiser that the U.S. was on the wrong side of history in its "war of Obama’s choosing" in Afghanistan. Steele argued that the conflict, which he called "a war Obama wanted to engage in," was not "prosecuted" by the U.S. actively. He criticized Obama for "flipping a script demonizing Iraq" while shifting focus to Afghanistan, questioning whether Obama understood the historical risks of "engaging in a land war" there. Steele later clarified that he supports "winning the war on terror" and "giving our troops the support necessary for success," referencing the "tragedy" of 9/11. However, critics, including conservative William Kristol, accused Steele of "betting against our troops" and "rooting for failure" in Afghanistan, arguing the war was not "Obama’s choosing" but began under Bush. Steele’s remarks sparked controversy, with some questioning his leadership as party chairman. END OF SUMMARY.
