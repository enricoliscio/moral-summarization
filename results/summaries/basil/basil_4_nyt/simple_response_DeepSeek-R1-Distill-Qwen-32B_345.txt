Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral arguments.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, who made some controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing" and questioning the US involvement. This drew a lot of criticism, including calls for his resignation.

I should note that Steele's comments were seen as undermining the war effort, which is a moral issue because supporting the troops is a significant value. Critics like Kristol and Woodhouse argue that as a party leader, Steele shouldn't be opposing the war, especially since it was started under Bush and continued under Obama.

Steele tried to clarify his stance, emphasizing the necessity of winning the war and supporting troop increases. This shows he's trying to balance his criticism with support for the troops, but his initial remarks still caused controversy.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral implications: the criticism of Steele's stance as disloyal or undermining the troops, and his own defense that he supports the troops but is critical of the strategy. Also, the broader context of the war's history and the political implications for the Republican party.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the main points: Steele's criticism, the reactions, his clarification, and the context of the war. I'll structure it to highlight the moral framing, showing both sides of the argument and the implications for leadership and troop support.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start by introducing Steele's remarks, then the criticism, his clarification, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to mention the key players and their positions to provide a balanced view.
