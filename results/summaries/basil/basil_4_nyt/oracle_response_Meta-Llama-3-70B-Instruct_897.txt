SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fund-raiser, claiming the US is on the "wrong side of history" in Afghanistan, a "war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was met with fierce criticism, with some calling for his resignation. Steele argued that the president was trying to "flip a script" by shifting focus from Iraq to Afghanistan, and that engaging in a "land war" in Afghanistan is a mistake. However, Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that "America must win the war on terror." Critics, including conservative William Kristol, argued that Steele's comments were a "gaffe" and that the war in Afghanistan was not "a war of Obama's choosing," but rather a continuation of a conflict started by President George W. Bush. Democrats accused Steele of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure" in Afghanistan. Steele maintained that the US must "give our troops the support necessary to win this war" and that "winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task, but also a necessary one."
