SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made controversial remarks at a party fundraiser, stating that the US was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks sparked fierce criticism and calls for his resignation, with many disagreeing with his characterization of the war as Obama's decision. Steele later issued a statement clarifying his support for winning the war on terror and emphasizing the need to give troops the necessary support to succeed in Afghanistan. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war in Afghanistan was not solely Obama's choice and that Steele's tenure as party leader had been marked by gaffes. Despite the criticism, Republican officials dismissed the calls for Steele's resignation, and Steele stood by his clarification.
END OF SUMMARY.
