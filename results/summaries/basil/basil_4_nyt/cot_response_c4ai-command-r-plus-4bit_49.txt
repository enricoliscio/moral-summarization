SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced fierce *criticism* and calls for his *resignation* after controversial remarks made at a party fundraiser. Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, referring to it as a "war of Obama's choosing." He questioned the wisdom of engaging in a land war in Afghanistan and suggested that Obama was "trying to be *cute* by half by *demonizing* Iraq." These comments sparked backlash, with William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, calling for Steele's *resignation*. Kristol argued that the war in Afghanistan was not a matter of partisan politics and that Steele's comments undermined the efforts of U.S. troops. Steele issued a clarification, affirming the need to win the war on terror and expressing support for General Petraeus's confirmation. However, his remarks sparked concerns about his suitability as the Republican Party leader, with some believing he was *betting* against U.S. troops and *rooting* for *failure* in Afghanistan. The incident highlights the challenges faced by Steele during his tenure as party chairman, marked by *embarrassments* and controversial statements.
