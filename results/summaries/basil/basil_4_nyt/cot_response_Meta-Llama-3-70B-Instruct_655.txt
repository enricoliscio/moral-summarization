SUMMARY:
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, saying the US is on the "wrong" side of history in Afghanistan, a war he deemed "Obama's choosing". Steele's comments were deemed "embarrassing" and "gaffes" by critics, who argued that the war was started by former President George W. Bush and continued by President Obama. Steele's remarks were seen as "rooting" for failure and "betting" against US troops. Conservative voices, including William Kristol, called for Steele's resignation, saying his tenure has been marked by "gaffes" and "embarrassments". Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that the US must "win" the war on terror and that Afghanistan is now Obama's war, emphasizing the "necessary" task of supporting US troops to achieve "success". END OF SUMMARY.
