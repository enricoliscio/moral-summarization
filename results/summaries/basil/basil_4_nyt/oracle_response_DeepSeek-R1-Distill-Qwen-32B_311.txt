Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made some controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama’s choosing" and questioning the U.S. involvement. He suggested that the U.S. shouldn't have engaged in a land war there. This drew criticism, with some calling for his resignation. Steele tried to clarify, saying he supports winning the war on terror but emphasized it's Obama's war. Others, like Kristol, argued the war started under Bush and Obama just shifted focus. The article uses words like "fight," "war," "choosing," "prosecuted," etc., which I need to include in the summary.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the conflict, Steele's criticism, the reactions, and the context of the war. I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and to the point.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it captures the key points and retains the moral language. I'll start with Steele's criticism, mention the words used, the reactions from Kristol and Democrats, and Steele's clarification. I'll keep it within the word limit and make sure it flows logically.
