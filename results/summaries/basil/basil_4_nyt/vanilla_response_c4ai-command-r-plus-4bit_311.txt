SUMMARY: Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked controversy with his remarks at a party fundraiser, criticizing President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan and referring to it as "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments were met with fierce backlash, including a call for his resignation by conservative commentator William Kristol. Steele's statement suggested that the United States was on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan and that Obama had "flipped a script" by shifting focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. He later clarified his position, acknowledging the need to win the war on terror and supporting the decision to increase troop presence in Afghanistan. Despite Steele's attempts at clarification, his comments were characterized as betting against U.S. troops and rooting for failure. The controversy surrounding Steele's remarks adds to a series of previous controversial statements he has made during his tenure as party chairman.
