Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized the Afghanistan war, calling it "Obama's war" and questioning the U.S. involvement. He implied that Obama shifted focus from Iraq to Afghanistan and made a strategic mistake. Steele later tried to clarify his statements, emphasizing that America must win the war on terror, but his initial comments caused a stir.

William Kristol, a conservative commentator, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war started under Bush, not Obama. Democrats also criticized Steele for undermining U.S. troops. Republican officials dismissed these criticisms, but Steele's remarks have been a pattern of controversial statements.
