Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Michael Steele's comments on the Afghanistan war. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the key points and the underlying messages about leadership, support for troops, and the political implications.

First, the article mentions that Michael Steele, RNC chairman, criticized Obama's strategy, calling the war "Obama's choosing." He implied the US was on the wrong side of history. That's a strong statement, so I should highlight that. 

Next, there's criticism from William Kristol and others, including Democrats, who argue that the war started under Bush, not Obama. They're upset because Steele, as a party leader, is questioning the war. 

Steele later clarifies, saying the US must win the war on terror, but his initial remarks caused a stir. The moral framing here is about leadership and support for troops. Steele is seen as undermining the troops, which is a big deal in politics, especially for a party chairman.

I need to make sure the summary captures the conflict between Steele's comments and the reactions, emphasizing the political fallout and the moral implications of his statements. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to show Steele's criticism, the backlash, his clarification, and the ongoing debate about the war's necessity.

I should avoid getting bogged down in too many details, like the troop numbers or specific political figures, unless they're central to the moral argument. The focus should be on the leadership and support aspects, as that's where the moral framing lies.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's concise. I'll start with Steele's criticism, mention the backlash, include his clarification, and conclude with the political implications. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral angle.
