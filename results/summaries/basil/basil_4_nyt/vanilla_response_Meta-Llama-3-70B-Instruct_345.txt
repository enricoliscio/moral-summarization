SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele faced criticism and calls for his resignation after stating that the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments, made at a party fundraiser, were criticized by conservatives and Democrats alike. William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, called for Steele's resignation, saying that Steele's remarks were a "gaffe" and that the war in Afghanistan was not started by Obama, but by former President George W. Bush. Steele later clarified his remarks, saying that the US must win the war on terror and that Afghanistan is a necessary war. However, his initial comments sparked outrage, with Democrats accusing him of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan."
