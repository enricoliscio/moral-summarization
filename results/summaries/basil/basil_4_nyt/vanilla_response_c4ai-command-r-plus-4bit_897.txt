He later clarified his statement, emphasizing the need to win the war on terror and support troops in Afghanistan. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war in Afghanistan was not initiated by Obama and that Steele's comments undermined the Republican Party's stance. The war in Afghanistan, started by President Bush after the 9/11 attacks, has been continued by Obama with an increased troop presence. Steele's comments sparked debate and highlighted tensions within the Republican Party. Steele defended his position, stating that winning the war in Afghanistan is necessary for global security.
