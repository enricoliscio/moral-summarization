SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his comments at a party fundraiser, suggesting that the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan and that the war is "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks were widely criticized, with some calling for his resignation. Critics argue that Steele's comments undermine the war effort and betray a lack of understanding of the conflict's history, which began under President George W. Bush in response to the 9/11 attacks. Steele's attempts to clarify his remarks only added to the controversy, with many seeing his words as a betrayal of US troops and a failure of leadership. The incident has raised questions about Steele's fitness to lead the Republican Party.
