SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made controversial remarks at a party fundraiser, stating that the US was on the wrong side of history in the Afghanistan conflict, which he called "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments sparked fierce criticism and calls for his resignation, with some arguing that he was "betting against our troops and rooting for failure." While Steele later clarified his support for winning the war on terror, his comments prompted discussions about the morality of the war in Afghanistan and the role of the US in prosecuting it. Steele's remarks also highlighted the challenges faced by a political party chairman, as he walked a fine line between expressing his own opinions and representing the views of his party. The moral framing of the article revolves around words like "war," "choosing," "prosecuted," "engage," "demonizing," "battle," "attacks," "betting," "rooting," "taken," "security," "support," and "tragedy." Steele's comments and the subsequent backlash showcase the ethical dilemmas and moral judgments inherent in political discourse, especially when discussing issues of national security and international conflict.
