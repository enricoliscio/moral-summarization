SUMMARY:
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, claiming the US is on the "wrong" side of history in Afghanistan, a "war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critics argue that his statement is a "gaffe" and an "embarrassment" to the party. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, saying that Steele's tenure has been marked by "gaffes and embarrassments." Democrats accused Steele of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure" in Afghanistan. Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that the US must "win this war" and that it is a "necessary" fight for the "security of the free world." However, his initial comments have sparked controversy and raised questions about his leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
