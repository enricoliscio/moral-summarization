SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, claiming that the US is on the wrong side of history in the Afghanistan conflict, which he called "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments were widely criticized, with many calling for his resignation. Conservative voices, including William Kristol, condemned Steele's statement, pointing out that the war in Afghanistan was started by President George W. Bush and continued by President Obama. Steele's remarks were seen as a betrayal of US troops and a rooting for failure in Afghanistan. In a subsequent statement, Steele attempted to clarify his remarks, stating that the US must win the war on terror and supporting the decision to increase troop force in Afghanistan. However, the damage was already done, and Steele's leadership was called into question. His comments were seen as a moral failure, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the war's history and a lack of support for US troops.

END OF SUMMARY.
