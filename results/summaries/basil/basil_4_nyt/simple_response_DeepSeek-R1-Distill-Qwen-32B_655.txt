Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, made controversial remarks at a fundraiser, criticizing Obama's Afghanistan strategy. He called it "a war of Obama's choosing" and questioned the U.S. involvement. This led to criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with some calling for his resignation. Steele later clarified his stance, supporting troop efforts but still emphasizing Obama's role. The article also mentions the history of the war, started by Bush after 9/11, and Obama's troop surge. Key players like Kristol and Woodhouse are involved, with Kristol opposing Steele's comments and Woodhouse criticizing him for undermining troops. Steele's supporters argue his comments were mischaracterized. 

I should highlight the controversy, the criticism from both sides, Steele's clarification, and the context of the war. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the moral framing, like the criticism of Steele's remarks as disloyal or undermining troops. Also, mention the broader implications for the Republican party's stance on the war. I'll structure it to flow from the event, the reactions, Steele's response, and the context. Let me put it all together concisely.
