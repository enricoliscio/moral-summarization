SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked controversy by stating that the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy, saying the president was trying to be "cute by half" by shifting focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. Steele's remarks drew fierce criticism, with William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, calling for Steele's resignation as party leader. Kristol argued that the war in Afghanistan was not started by Obama, but rather by former President George W. Bush in response to 9/11. Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that America must win the war on terror and that Afghanistan is now Obama's war. The Democratic National Committee accused Steele of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan."
