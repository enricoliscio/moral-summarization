SUMMARY: Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee chairman, made controversial statements at a party fundraiser, criticizing President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan and referring to the conflict as "a war of Obama's choosing." His remarks sparked fierce backlash and calls for his resignation, with critics arguing that he was undermining U.S. troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan. While Steele later clarified his comments and affirmed the need to win the war on terror, he stood by his assertion that Afghanistan had become Obama's war. William Kristol, a prominent conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, stating that the war in Afghanistan was not solely Obama's choice but a necessary response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Steele's controversial statements have been a recurring theme during his tenure as party chairman, often overshadowing his leadership.
