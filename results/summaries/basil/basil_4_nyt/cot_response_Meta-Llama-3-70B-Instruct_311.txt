SUMMARY:
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, claiming the US is on the "wrong" side of history in Afghanistan, a "war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was deemed "embarrassing" and "cute" by some. His comments prompted calls for his resignation, with critics accusing him of "betting against our troops" and "rooting for failure" in Afghanistan. Steele later clarified his stance, saying the US must "win" the war on terror and that Afghanistan is now Obama's war. Despite the backlash, Steele maintained that the US must give its troops the necessary support to achieve "success" in Afghanistan, a "necessary" and difficult task. END OF SUMMARY.
