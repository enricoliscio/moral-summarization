SUMMARY:
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, saying the US is on the "wrong" side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments were deemed "embarrassing" and "gaffes" by critics, who argued that the war was started by former President George W. Bush, not Obama. Steele's words were seen as "betting against our troops" and "rooting for failure" in Afghanistan. In response to the backlash, Steele clarified that the US must "win" the war on terror, citing the "necessary" task of securing the free world. Despite the controversy, Steele maintained that Afghanistan is now Obama's war, and that "success" is crucial. END OF SUMMARY.
