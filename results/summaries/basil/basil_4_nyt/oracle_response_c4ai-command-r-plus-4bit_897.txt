SUMMARY: Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee chairman, faced fierce backlash and calls for his resignation after controversial remarks made at a party fundraiser. Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, characterizing the conflict as "a war of Obama's choosing." He questioned the wisdom of engaging in a land war in Afghanistan and suggested that Obama was "flipping a script demonizing Iraq" while shifting focus to Afghanistan. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war was not solely of Obama's choosing but a conflict prosecuted by both Presidents Bush and Obama. Steele's comments were seen as betting against US troops and rooting for failure. Republican officials dismissed these criticisms, but Steele clarified his stance, emphasizing the need to win the war on terror and supporting the decision to increase troop presence. Steele's remarks highlight the political tensions surrounding the war in Afghanistan and the challenges faced by the party chairman in navigating these complex issues.
