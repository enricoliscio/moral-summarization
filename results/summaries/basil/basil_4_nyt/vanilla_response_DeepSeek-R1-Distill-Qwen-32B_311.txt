Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, criticizing the Afghanistan war at a fundraiser. He called it "Obama's war" and suggested the U.S. was on the wrong side of history. This caused a lot of criticism, including calls for his resignation. William Kristol and Democrats criticized him, while Steele tried to clarify his stance, still supporting the troops. The war started under Bush, but Obama escalated it. The summary needs to capture the key points: Steele's remarks, the criticism, his clarification, and the context of the war.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all important details without getting too bogged down in specifics. I'll structure it to mention Steele's comments, the reactions, his clarification, and the background of the war. That should cover the main points effectively.
