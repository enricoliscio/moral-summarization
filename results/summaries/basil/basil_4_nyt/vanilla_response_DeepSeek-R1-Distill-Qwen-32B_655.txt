Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Steele's comments on the Afghanistan war. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Michael Steele, the chairman of the RNC, who made some controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing" and suggesting that the U.S. was on the wrong side of history. This drew a lot of criticism, including calls for his resignation.

I should note that the article provides context about the war, explaining it started under Bush after 9/11 and was shifted to by Obama. Steele's statement is seen as controversial because he's the RNC chairman, and his comments were used against him by Democrats. William Kristol, a conservative voice, criticized him, saying the war wasn't Obama's choice but Bush's, and that Steele's position is harmful.

Steele tried to clarify his remarks, stating that the U.S. must win the war on terror, but his initial comments were problematic. The article also mentions that the video of his speech was taken by a hidden camera, which adds to the controversy.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points: Steele's criticism, the context of the war, the reactions from Kristol and Democrats, and Steele's attempt to clarify. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Let me outline the key points:
1. Steele's statement at the fundraiser about Afghanistan being Obama's war.
2. Criticism from Democrats and Kristol.
3. Context of the war's origin under Bush and continuation under Obama.
4. Steele's clarification and support for the troops.
5. The hidden camera incident and the impact on his position.

Now, I'll condense these into a coherent summary, making sure to include all important details without going over the word limit.
