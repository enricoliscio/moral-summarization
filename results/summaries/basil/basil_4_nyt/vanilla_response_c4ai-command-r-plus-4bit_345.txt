SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made controversial remarks at a party fundraiser, criticizing President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan and referring to it as "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments sparked fierce backlash, with critics pointing out that the war in Afghanistan was initiated by former President George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war is not a partisan issue and that Steele's comments undermined the Republican Party's support for the war. Steele issued a clarification, stating that winning the war on terror is crucial, but stood by his characterization of the conflict as Obama's war. He emphasized the need to support the troops and referenced General Petraeus's confirmation to highlight the importance of success in Afghanistan. Steele's tenure as party chairman has been marked by several controversial statements, and his remarks on Afghanistan sparked debates within the Republican Party.
