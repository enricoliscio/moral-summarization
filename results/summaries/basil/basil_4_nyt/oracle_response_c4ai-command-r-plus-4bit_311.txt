SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced intense criticism and calls for his resignation after controversial remarks made at a party fundraiser. Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, characterizing it as "a war of Obama's choosing." He questioned the wisdom of engaging in a land war in Afghanistan and suggested that Obama was "flipping a script" by demonizing Iraq while shifting focus to Afghanistan. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war was not of Obama's choosing but a necessary battle against terrorism. Brad Woodhouse, a Democratic National Committee spokesman, accused Steele of betting against US troops and rooting for failure. Steele later clarified his remarks, emphasizing the need to win the war on terror and supporting the decision to increase troop presence. He acknowledged the difficulty of winning in Afghanistan while stressing that it is a necessary fight for the security of the free world.
