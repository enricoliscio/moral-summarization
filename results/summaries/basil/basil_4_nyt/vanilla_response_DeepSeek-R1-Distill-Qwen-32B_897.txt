Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. It's about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making some controversial remarks about the Afghanistan war. He called it "Obama's war" and questioned the US involvement. That's interesting because the war started under Bush after 9/11. Steele's comments led to criticism, with some calling for his resignation. William Kristol and others from the DNC are involved. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: who Michael Steele is, his comments, the reaction from both sides, and the context of the war. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Maybe start with his position and the criticism, then his statement, the response from Kristol and the DNC, and his clarification. Also, mention that the event was a fundraiser with hidden camera footage. 

I should avoid getting too deep into the details, just the key facts. Make sure to include that the war started under Bush and Obama shifted focus. Steele's support for Petraeus is a point to note as well. 

Let me structure it: introduce Steele and his remarks, the criticism from Kristol and DNC, his clarification, and the context of the war. Keep each sentence brief. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together in a clear, concise summary.
