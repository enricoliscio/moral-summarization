SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fund-raiser, claiming the US is on the "wrong side of history" in the Afghanistan conflict, which he dubbed "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was met with fierce criticism, with some calling for his resignation. Steele's comments were seen as a "bet" against US troops and a desire for "failure" in Afghanistan. Republican officials dismissed the criticism, but Steele's remarks were widely condemned, including by conservative voices like William Kristol, who called for Steele's resignation. Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that "America must win the war on terror" and that "winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task, but also a necessary one" in the wake of the "tragedy" of 9/11.
