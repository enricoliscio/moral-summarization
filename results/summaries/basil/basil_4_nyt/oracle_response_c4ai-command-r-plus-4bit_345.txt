SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made controversial remarks at a party fundraiser, criticizing President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan and calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks sparked fierce criticism and calls for his resignation, as he seemed to be betting against US troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan. Steele's comments were seen as a strong critique of Obama's decision to shift the focus of the war on terror from Iraq to Afghanistan and to increase troop presence. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war in Afghanistan was not a matter of choice but a necessary battle against terrorism. Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that America must win the war on terror and that he supported the decision to increase troop numbers. He emphasized the necessity of winning the war for the security of the free world, referencing the tragedy of the September 11 attacks. Steele's comments highlight the political tensions and ethical dilemmas surrounding the war in Afghanistan.
