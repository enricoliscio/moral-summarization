Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Michael Steele, RNC chairman, making controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama’s choosing" and questioning the U.S. involvement. This led to calls for his resignation, especially from William Kristol. Steele later tried to clarify his stance, emphasizing the necessity of winning the war on terror and supporting troop increases.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author: fight, war, choosing, prosecuted, engage, flipping, demonizing, battle, attacks, betting, rooting, taken, security, support, tragedy. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary.

I'll start by mentioning Steele's remarks at the fundraiser, using "criticized" and "controversy." Then, I'll include his specific statements about the war being Obama's choice and the U.S. not wanting to engage. I'll note the criticism from Kristol and the Democratic response. I'll make sure to use words like "betting against," "rooting for failure," and "security" to maintain the moral framing. Finally, I'll summarize Steele's clarification, using "support" and "tragedy" from 9/11.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points and the necessary moral terms. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all elements are covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked controversy after criticizing President Obama’s military strategy in Afghanistan, calling it “a war of Obama’s choosing.” At a party fundraiser, Steele argued that the U.S. had not “actively prosecuted” the conflict and questioned Obama’s decision to focus on Afghanistan over Iraq. He later clarified, emphasizing the need to “win the war on terror” and support troops. However, his remarks drew sharp criticism, with William Kristol, a conservative leader, calling for his resignation. Kristol accused Steele of misrepresenting the war’s origins, noting it was initiated under President Bush. Democrats also criticized Steele for “betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.” Steele defended his stance, stating that Afghanistan was now Obama’s war and that success was crucial for global security. The incident highlights ongoing debates over U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and the political stakes of military strategy. END OF SUMMARY.
