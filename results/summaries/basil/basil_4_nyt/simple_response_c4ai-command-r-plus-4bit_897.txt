SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made controversial statements at a party fundraiser, criticizing President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan and referring to it as "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks sparked fierce backlash and calls for his resignation, as they downplayed the bipartisan nature of the war effort and seemed to bet against the success of US troops. In his speech, Steele questioned the strategy of engaging in a land war in Afghanistan and suggested that Obama had "flipped a script" by shifting focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war was not solely of Obama's choosing but a bipartisan effort. Despite criticism, Steele stood by his comments, emphasizing the need to win the war on terror and support General Petraeus's confirmation. Steele's statement reflected a moral stance on the war, framing success in Afghanistan as necessary for the security of the free world, especially in light of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Steele's controversial statements highlight the ethical and political complexities surrounding the war in Afghanistan.
