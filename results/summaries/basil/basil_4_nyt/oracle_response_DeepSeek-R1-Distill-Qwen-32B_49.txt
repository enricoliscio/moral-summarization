Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, criticized the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan at a fundraiser, calling it "Obama's war" and questioning the strategy. This led to criticism and calls for his resignation. 

I should identify the morally framed words the author used: fight, war, choosing, prosecuted, engage, flipping, demonizing, battle, attacks, betting, rooting, taken, security, support, tragedy. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

The key points are:
1. Steele's criticism of Obama's strategy.
2. His statement that the war was Obama's choice, not the U.S.'s active prosecution.
3. The criticism from Kristol and others, calling for his resignation.
4. Steele's clarification and support for troop support and Petraeus.
5. The context of the war started by Bush after 9/11.

I'll structure the summary to include these points, using the moral terms. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced criticism and calls for his resignation after stating at a fundraiser that the U.S. was on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama’s choosing." Steele criticized President Obama’s military strategy, suggesting it was a "land war in Afghanistan," which he implied was a mistake. While clarifying his remarks, Steele emphasized the necessity of winning the war on terror and supported troop efforts, referencing General Petraeus’s confirmation. Critics, including William Kristol, argued the war was not Obama’s alone, having been prosecuted under both Bush and Obama. Steele’s comments were seen as "betting against our troops" and "rooting for failure," though he maintained it was Obama’s war. The debate underscores the moral and strategic stakes in Afghanistan, a conflict initiated after the 9/11 attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
