SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced intense backlash and calls for his resignation following controversial remarks made at a party fundraiser. In his speech, Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, characterizing the conflict as "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments sparked outrage from figures like William Kristol, who argued that the war in Afghanistan was not initiated by Obama but rather a necessary response to the attacks on September 11, 2001. Steele's remarks were deemed as "betting against our troops and rooting for failure" by a Democratic National Committee spokesman. Republican officials, however, dismissed this interpretation. Steele later issued a statement clarifying his stance, emphasizing the need to win the "war on terror" and providing support to troops in Afghanistan. He acknowledged the difficulty of winning a war in Afghanistan but stressed its necessity in the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy. Steele's statement also expressed support for General Petraeus's confirmation and the decision to increase troop presence. Nonetheless, his initial comments sparked debate and raised questions about his suitability as the Republican Party leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
