SUMMARY: Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele's recent comments on the war in Afghanistan have sparked fierce criticism and calls for his resignation. In a speech at a party fundraiser, Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy, referring to the conflict as "a war of Obama's choosing." This statement sparked backlash as the war in Afghanistan was initiated by former President George W. Bush in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Steele's remarks were seen as betting against U.S. troops and rooting for failure. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, stating that the war is not one of Obama's choosing but a necessary fight against terrorism. Steele later issued a statement clarifying his support for winning the war on terror and emphasizing the need to provide necessary support to troops in Afghanistan. He framed the war as a difficult but necessary task to ensure the security of the free world. However, his comments continue a pattern of controversial statements during his tenure as party chairman.
END OF SUMMARY.
