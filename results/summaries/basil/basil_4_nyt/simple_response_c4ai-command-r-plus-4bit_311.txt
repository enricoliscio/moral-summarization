SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made controversial remarks at a party fundraiser, criticizing President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan and referring to it as "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments sparked fierce backlash and calls for his resignation, as they downplayed the bipartisan nature of the war effort and seemed to bet against the success of U.S. troops. While seeking to clarify his remarks, Steele emphasized the need to win the war on terror and provide necessary support to troops. He framed the war in Afghanistan as a necessary response to the September 11 attacks. However, critics argued that Steele's initial comments undermined the bipartisan support for the war and that his role as party chairman was incompatible with his stance on the war. Steele's comments reflect a moral dilemma between upholding partisan interests and acknowledging the complex realities of the war, with potential consequences for national unity and support for troops on the ground.
END OF SUMMARY.
