SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced fierce criticism and calls for his resignation after controversial remarks about the war in Afghanistan. Steele criticized President Obama's strategy, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing" and suggesting the US was on the wrong side of history. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war was not solely "a war of Obama's choosing" but a necessary battle against terrorism. Steele's remarks were seen as betting against US troops and rooting for failure. Steele clarified his stance, stating that the US must win the war on terror and support troops to succeed in Afghanistan. He emphasized the importance of historical lessons and the need to learn from them, acknowledging the challenging yet necessary nature of the war for the security of the free world. Steele's comments reflect a morally framed debate about the war in Afghanistan, with critics calling for his resignation and others defending his right to express his views. Steele's stance on the war remains a contentious issue within the Republican Party and the nation.
