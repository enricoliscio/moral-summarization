SUMMARY:
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, declaring that the US is on the "wrong" side of history in Afghanistan, a "war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was met with fierce criticism, with some calling for his resignation. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, condemned Steele's comments as "embarrassing" and "gaffes," arguing that the war in Afghanistan was not started by Obama, but rather by former President George W. Bush. Democrats seized on the opportunity to attack Steele, accusing him of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure" in Afghanistan. Steele attempted to clarify his remarks, stating that "there is no question that America must win the war on terror," but the damage was already done. END OF SUMMARY.
