SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, claiming the US is on the "wrong side of history" in the Afghanistan conflict, which he dubbed "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy, saying the president was trying to "flip a script" by shifting focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. Steele's comments drew fierce criticism, with William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, calling for his resignation as party leader. Kristol argued that Steele's remarks were a "gaffe" and that the war in Afghanistan was not Obama's choice, but a continuation of a conflict started by former President George W. Bush. Democrats seized on Steele's comments, accusing him of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure" in Afghanistan. Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that the US must win the "war on terror" and that Afghanistan is now Obama's war, requiring US support to achieve "security" and "success."
