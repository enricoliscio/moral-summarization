SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee chairman, sparked outrage by declaring that the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks were met with fierce criticism, with some calling for his resignation. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, slammed Steele's comments as "gaffes and embarrassments" and argued that the war in Afghanistan was not started by Obama, but by former President George W. Bush. Kristol demanded Steele's resignation, stating that the chairman's views were incompatible with the party's stance on the war. Democrats also pounced on Steele's remarks, accusing him of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan." Steele later attempted to clarify his remarks, but the damage was done. His comments were widely seen as a betrayal of the troops and a failure of leadership.

END OF SUMMARY.
