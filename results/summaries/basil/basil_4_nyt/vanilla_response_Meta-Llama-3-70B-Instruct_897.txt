SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with comments suggesting the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy, saying the US didn't want to engage in the conflict. However, the war in Afghanistan was started by former President George W. Bush in response to 9/11. Steele's remarks prompted calls for his resignation, including from conservative William Kristol, who said Steele's comments were a "gaffe" and that the war was prosecuted by both Bush and Obama. Democrats also criticized Steele, saying he was "betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan." Steele later issued a statement clarifying his remarks, saying the US must win the war on terror and supporting the decision to increase troop forces in Afghanistan.
