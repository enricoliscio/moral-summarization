SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked outrage and calls for his resignation after claiming that the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks were criticized for being inaccurate and disrespectful to the troops. The war in Afghanistan was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the 9/11 attacks, and President Obama shifted the focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. Steele's comments were seen as a betrayal of the troops and a lack of understanding of history. Even conservative supporters of the war, such as William Kristol, called for Steele's resignation, stating that the chairman of the Republican Party should not be advocating for defeat. Steele's attempt to clarify his remarks only added to the controversy, and his criticism of Obama's military strategy was seen as misguided and harmful.
