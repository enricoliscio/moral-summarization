SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced fierce criticism and calls for his resignation after controversial remarks made at a party fundraiser. Steele criticized the war in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing" and questioning the strategy. He later issued a statement saying that "there is no question that America must win the war on terror". However, his comments were seen as betting against US troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan. Steele's tenure has been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, and his remarks prompted a leading conservative voice to call for his resignation. The war in Afghanistan, now in its ninth year, was started by President Bush after the terrorists attacks of September 11, 2001. Obama shifted the focus to Afghanistan and increased troop levels. Steele's comments were seen as a strong critique of Obama's strategy and a disputing of the war's morality. In his statement, Steele emphasized the need to support troops and win the war, acknowledging the difficult but necessary task of achieving success in Afghanistan. 

END OF SUMMARY.
