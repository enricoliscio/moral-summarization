SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele faced criticism and calls for his resignation after stating that the US is on the wrong side of history in the Afghanistan conflict, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele claimed that the US did not actively prosecute or want to engage in the war, and that President Obama shifted focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. However, the war in Afghanistan was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the 9/11 attacks. Steele's comments prompted conservative William Kristol to call for his resignation, stating that Steele's remarks were a "gaffe" and that the war in Afghanistan was prosecuted by both Bush and Obama. Democratic officials also criticized Steele, saying he was "betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan." Steele later clarified his remarks, stating that the US must win the war on terror and supporting the decision to increase troop forces in Afghanistan.
