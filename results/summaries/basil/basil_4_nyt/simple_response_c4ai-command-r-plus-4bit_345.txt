SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, came under fire and faced calls for his resignation after controversial remarks made at a party fundraiser. Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." He questioned the wisdom of engaging in a land war in Afghanistan and suggested that Obama had "flipped a script" by shifting focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice supporting the war, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war was not "a war of Obama's choosing" and that Steele, as party chairman, should not be betting against U.S. troops. Steele issued a clarification, stating that the U.S. must win the war on terror and that he supported the decision to increase troop presence. He emphasized the necessity of winning the war and supported General Petraeus's confirmation. However, his remarks sparked criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, highlighting his history of controversial statements. Steele's comments sparked a debate about the moral responsibility of political leaders in supporting military efforts and the ethical implications of questioning a commander-in-chief's military strategy.
END OF SUMMARY.
