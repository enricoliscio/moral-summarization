SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fund-raiser, declaring that the US is on the wrong side of history in its conflict in Afghanistan, a "war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was met with fierce criticism, with many calling for his resignation. Steele's comments were seen as a "bet" against US troops and a desire for "failure" in Afghanistan. In response, Steele issued a statement reiterating the importance of winning the "war on terror" and supporting US troops. However, his initial remarks were widely condemned, with many arguing that the war in Afghanistan was not started by Obama, but rather by former President George W. Bush in response to the 9/11 "attacks." The controversy has raised questions about Steele's leadership and his ability to "support" the US military effort.
