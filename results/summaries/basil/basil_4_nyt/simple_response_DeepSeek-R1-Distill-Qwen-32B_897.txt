Alright, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, okay, let me read through the article first.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making some controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing" and questioning why the U.S. is involved there. He also made some historical references about not getting into land wars in Afghanistan. 

Wait, the author's moral framing is important here. So I need to capture the criticism he faced for his comments, especially from within his own party. William Kristol called for his resignation, and Democrats criticized him as well. The author seems to present this as a conflict within the Republican party, highlighting the internal divisions over the war in Afghanistan.

I should make sure the summary includes the key points: Steele's criticism of Obama's strategy, his historical reference, the reaction from Kristol and Democrats, and Steele's clarification. Also, the fact that the event was closed to the press but a video was leaked, which adds context to why the remarks were controversial.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise. Let me structure it: start with Steele's remarks, the criticism he received, his clarification, and the implications for the party.

Wait, the user also mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. So I should ensure that the moral implications are clear—like the criticism over his stance on the war and the potential impact on party unity.

Okay, putting it all together, I'll make sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit.
