SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced fierce criticism and calls for his resignation after controversial remarks about the war in Afghanistan. Steele criticized President Obama's military strategy, suggesting the US was on the wrong side of history and that Afghanistan was "a war of Obama's choosing." He later clarified his comments, stating that winning the war on terror was necessary for the free world's security. Steele's remarks sparked outrage, with critics accusing him of betting against US troops and rooting for failure. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war was not of Obama's choosing but a necessary response to the September 11 attacks. Steele's comments were the latest in a series of controversial statements during his tenure as party chairman. The incident highlights the moral dilemmas and political sensitivities surrounding the war in Afghanistan, with Steele's remarks igniting a debate about the morality of the war and the role of the US in global conflicts.
