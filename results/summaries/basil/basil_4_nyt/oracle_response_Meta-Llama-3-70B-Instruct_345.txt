SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, declaring that the US is on the "wrong side of history" in its conflict in Afghanistan, a "war of Obama's choosing". Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was met with fierce criticism, with some calling for his resignation. Steele's comments were seen as a "bet" against US troops and a desire for "failure" in Afghanistan. Republican officials dismissed the criticism, but Steele's remarks were widely condemned. In a later statement, Steele attempted to clarify his remarks, saying that the US must "win the war on terror" and that Afghanistan is now Obama's "battle". Steele's comments were seen as a "gaffe" and an "embarrassment" to the Republican Party.
