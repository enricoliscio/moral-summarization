SUMMARY:

Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked outrage with his remarks at a party fundraiser, claiming that the US is on the wrong side of history in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was met with fierce criticism, with many calling for his resignation. William Kristol, a leading conservative voice, condemned Steele's comments, saying that the war in Afghanistan was not started by Obama, but by former President George W. Bush in response to 9/11. Kristol argued that Steele's remarks were a betrayal of the troops and the Republican Party's principles. Steele later attempted to clarify his remarks, stating that the US must win the war on terror, but the damage was already done. His comments were seen as a moral failure, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the war's history and a lack of support for the troops. 

END OF SUMMARY.
