Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, criticizing the Afghanistan war as "Obama's war." He said the U.S. was on the wrong side of history and compared it to a land war in Afghanistan, which he implied was a bad idea. He later clarified that the U.S. must win the war on terror.

I should note the key points: Steele's criticism, the context of the war started by Bush, Obama's shift in focus, the reactions from Kristol and Democrats, and Steele's clarification.

I need to maintain the moral aspects, like whether the U.S. is on the right side and the implications of criticizing the war effort. Also, the political fallout and calls for resignation are important.

I'll structure the summary to include Steele's initial remarks, the historical context, the responses from both sides, and his clarification. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, sparked controversy by labeling the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan as "a war of Obama’s choosing" and suggesting the U.S. was on the wrong side of history. Speaking at a fund-raiser, Steele criticized President Obama’s military strategy, comparing it to a land war in Afghanistan, which he implied was a flawed decision. His remarks drew sharp criticism, with conservative voices like William Kristol calling for his resignation, arguing the war was not Obama’s choice but had been ongoing since President Bush’s tenure. Democrats accused Steele of undermining U.S. troops, while Steele later clarified his stance, emphasizing the necessity of winning the war on terror and supporting troop increases. His comments highlighted the political divide over the conflict, with critics arguing his remarks were ill-timed and damaging to the party’s image. END OF SUMMARY.
