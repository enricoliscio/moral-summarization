SUMMARY:
Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee chairman, faced fierce moral criticism and calls for his resignation after condemning the United States' involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan. Steele described the war as "a war of Obama's choosing," despite it being initiated by former President George W. Bush in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Steele's critique of President Obama's military strategy was seen as controversial and inappropriate. William Kristol, a conservative voice supporting the war in Afghanistan, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that the war is not "a war of Obama's choosing" and that Steele's tenure as party leader has been marked by gaffes and embarrassments. Steele's remarks were also condemned by the Democratic National Committee, who accused him of "betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan." Republican officials dismissed this moral criticism and defended Steele's comments. Steele later clarified his stance, stating that the US must win the war on terror and give troops the necessary support to succeed in Afghanistan. He emphasized the necessity of winning the war, citing the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Steele's controversial statements highlight the moral dilemmas and political sensitivities surrounding the war in Afghanistan.
