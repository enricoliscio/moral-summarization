SUMMARY:

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele faced criticism and calls for his resignation after stating that the US is on the wrong side of history in the Afghanistan conflict, which he called "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele made the remarks at a party fundraiser in Connecticut, sparking outrage from both Democrats and Republicans. Steele claimed that President Obama shifted the focus of the war on terror from Iraq to Afghanistan, and that the US did not actively want to engage in the conflict. However, Steele later issued a statement clarifying his remarks, saying that America must win the war on terror and that he supports the decision to increase troop forces in Afghanistan. The war in Afghanistan was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the 9/11 attacks, and Obama has continued to prosecute it. Steele's comments were seen as a gaffe and an embarrassment to the Republican Party.
