Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the context and the key points.

The article is about Michael Steele, the RNC chairman, making controversial remarks at a fundraiser. He criticized Obama's military strategy in Afghanistan, calling it "a war of Obama's choosing" and questioning the US's involvement. This led to criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with some calling for his resignation.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: fight, war, choosing, prosecuted, engage, flipping, demonizing, battle, attacks, betting, rooting, taken, security, support, tragedy.

I should make sure to include these words in the summary to maintain the moral tone. I'll structure the summary to include Steele's statements, the reactions, and the context of the war's history.

I'll start by introducing Steele and his remarks, using "fight" and "war." Then, mention how he criticized Obama, using "choosing," "prosecuted," and "flipping." I'll note the video footage and the criticism from Kristol and the DNC, using "betting against" and "rooting for failure." I'll also include Steele's clarification and his support for the troops, using "security" and "support." Finally, I'll add the historical context with the "tragedy" of 9/11.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral words are included naturally.

SUMMARY: Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, faced criticism and calls for his resignation after stating at a party fundraiser that the U.S. was on the wrong side of history in the Afghan war, which he called "a war of Obama’s choosing." Steele criticized President Obama’s military strategy, suggesting the conflict was not actively prosecuted by the U.S. and questioning the wisdom of engaging in a land war in Afghanistan. His remarks were widely circulated, prompting backlash from Democrats and conservatives, including William Kristol, who accused Steele of undermining the party’s stance on the war. Steele later clarified his comments, emphasizing the necessity of winning the war on terror and supporting troop efforts in Afghanistan. The conflict, initiated by President Bush after 9/11, has been a focal point under Obama, with Steele’s statements drawing attention to the political and moral stakes of the war. END OF SUMMARY.
