SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck electrified the CPAC crowd with a scathing critique of progressivism, labeling it a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He didn't spare Republicans, either, saying they're addicted to "spending and big government" and need to admit their problem. "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!" he declared, to thunderous applause. Beck argued that both parties are to blame, with Democrats "tax and spend" while Republicans just "spend". He lamented that people are losing faith that things will get better, but insisted it's still "morning in America", albeit a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning". Beck identified progressivism as the root disease, emphasizing personal responsibility and warning against demonizing or penalizing financial success. "I'm not going to pay for your mistakes and I don't expect you to pay for my mistakes," he said, to wild applause.
