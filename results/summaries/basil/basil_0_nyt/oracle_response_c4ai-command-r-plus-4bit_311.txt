SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the hero of the political right, delivered a rousing and morally charged speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he fervently denounced progressivism as a cancerous disease plaguing America. With his signature blend of personal anecdotes and political philosophy, Beck captivated the audience with his strong emphasis on personal responsibility. He criticized both the Republicans and Democrats, arguing that they were both guilty of reckless spending, with the Democrats taxing and the Republicans simply spending without restraint. Beck likened the state of the nation to a hangover, saying, "It's still morning in America... it just happens to be a head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning." He challenged the audience to reflect on the causes of their metaphorical suffering, refusing to simply blame President Obama. Beck's passionate address struck a chord with the audience, who cheered his message of financial success without demonization or penalization for personal mistakes.
