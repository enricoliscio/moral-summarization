SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a rousing speech denouncing progressivism as a *cancer* in America. He blamed both Democratic and Republican parties for the country's woes, arguing that Democrats "tax and spend," while Republicans simply "spend." Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between the party's spending addiction and his own struggles, declaring, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!" He emphasized personal responsibility, asking who can guarantee happiness and asserting that success should not be *demonized* or penalized. Beck captivated the audience with his blend of personal anecdotes and political philosophy, ultimately calling for a return to conservative values and financial accountability, stating, "I'm not going to pay for your *mistakes*, and I don't expect you to pay for mine," to thunderous applause.
