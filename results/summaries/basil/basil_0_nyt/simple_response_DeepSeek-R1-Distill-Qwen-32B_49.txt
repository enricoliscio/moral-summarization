Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. They specified that I need to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article is pretty detailed, so I need to extract the key points without losing the essence.

First, I should identify the main points. Glenn Beck is the closing speaker at CPAC, a conservative conference. He's criticizing progressivism, calling it a cancer. He's also taking shots at both Republicans and Democrats, saying Republicans don't stand for anything clear. He mentions his own experience as a recovering alcoholic to relate to the party's addiction to spending and big government. That's an interesting angle, showing he's using personal analogy for the party's issues.

He also contrasts Democrats who tax and spend with Republicans who just spend. He's talking about a loss of belief in a better future but still holds onto hope, likening it to a hung-over morning. He uses humor and personal stories, like Tiger Woods, to emphasize personal responsibility and the idea that financial success shouldn't be demonized. The audience's reaction is important too—he gets cheers and wild applause, showing his message resonated.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements. Also, the moral framing is crucial—Beck is positioning progressivism as a disease, promoting personal responsibility, and criticizing both parties for their failures. I should highlight his call for a return to conservative principles and the audience's enthusiastic response.

Let me structure this: start with Beck's role at CPAC, his main criticisms of progressivism and both parties, his personal analogy, the contrast between Democrats and Republicans, the metaphor about the morning in America, his use of humor and personal stories, the emphasis on financial success and personal responsibility, and conclude with the audience's reaction.

I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Maybe something like:

Glenn Beck, closing speaker at CPAC, criticized progressivism as a cancer and both parties for failing to address the nation's problems. He likened Republicans to an addict needing to admit their issues with spending and big government, while Democrats tax and spend. Despite the challenges, he maintained hope for America, using humor and personal stories about his recovery to stress personal responsibility. He argued against penalizing financial success and urged a return to conservative principles, resonating strongly with the audience.

That should cover all the key points while preserving the moral stance against progressivism and the call for accountability and hope.
