SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, a conservative icon, delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He didn't spare Republicans, either, saying they're addicted to spending and big government, just like Democrats. Beck emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, asking "Who can guarantee you happiness?" and arguing that financial success shouldn't be penalized. He also lamented that people are losing faith that things will get better, but optimistically declared, "It is still morning in America." Beck's message was clear: both parties are to blame for the country's woes, and progressivism is the root of the problem. His speech was met with cheers, applause, and laughter from the packed hotel ballroom.
