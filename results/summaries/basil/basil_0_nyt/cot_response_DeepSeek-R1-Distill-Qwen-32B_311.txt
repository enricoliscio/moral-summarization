Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also provided a specific structure: first, list all the morally framed single words, then write the summary. 

Looking at the article, I need to identify words that carry moral connotations. Words like "cancer," "progressivism," "spend," "addicted," "tax," "believe," "happiness," "demonized," "penalized," "mistakes." These words are used in a moral context by the speaker.

Now, for the summary, I have to keep it under 200 words and include as many of these words as possible. The article is about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC, criticizing both parties, especially Republicans, for spending and big government. He compares progressivism to a disease and emphasizes personal responsibility.

I should start by mentioning Beck's speech, his criticism of progressivism as a cancer, and his call for Republicans to acknowledge their issues. Then, touch on his comparison of both parties, the state of America, and his personal take on happiness and responsibility. Make sure to include the morally framed words naturally in the summary.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Also, maintain the moral tone from the original text. Let me structure it step by step: introduce Beck, his main points about progressivism, criticism of both parties, the state of America, and his personal philosophy on happiness and responsibility.

Double-checking the word count and the inclusion of all key morally framed words. Make sure each point is concise and the summary captures the essence of the article without losing the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Glenn Beck, addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), criticized progressivism as a "cancer" in American society and urged Republicans to confront their own issues, such as addiction to spending and big government. He accused both parties of failing the country, with Democrats taxing and spending while Republicans just spending. Beck likened the current state of America to a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning," suggesting that progressivism is the root cause of the nation's problems. He emphasized personal responsibility, stating that conservatives should not demonize financial success and that individuals should not pay for others' mistakes. His speech, filled with moral urgency, called for a return to traditional values and accountability.
