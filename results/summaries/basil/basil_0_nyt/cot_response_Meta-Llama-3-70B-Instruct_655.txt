SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be cut out of the system. He aimed his criticism at both Democrats and Republicans, saying the GOP had a "problem" with spending and big government, and needed to admit it. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between the party's addiction and his own, saying "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem! I'm addicted to spending and big government." He emphasized the importance of personal "responsibility" and warned against demonizing or penalizing financial success. Beck's message was clear: progressivism is a "disease" that must be cured, and it's still "morning in America," albeit a rough one. END OF SUMMARY.
