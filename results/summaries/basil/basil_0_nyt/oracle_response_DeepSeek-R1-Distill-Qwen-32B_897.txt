Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC, criticizing progressivism and both political parties. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included: suck, spending, tax, spend, vomit, suffering, demonized, penalized.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Beck is denouncing progressivism as a cancer, criticizing both Republicans and Democrats. He uses strong language, like "suck" and "vomit," to convey his frustration. He talks about the Republican Party's addiction to spending and big government, which ties into "spending." He also mentions Democrats taxing and spending, so I need to include "tax" and "spend." 

He uses the metaphor of a hung-over morning in America, which includes "vomit." He questions why people are suffering, pointing to progressivism as the root cause. He also addresses personal responsibility, saying people shouldn't be demonized or penalized for their success, so I need to include "demonized" and "penalized."

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Beck's speech at CPAC, his criticism of progressivism as a cancer. Then, I'll note his criticism of both parties, using "suck" and "spend." I'll include his metaphor about the morning in America and the vomiting, linking it to the nation's problems. I'll mention his personal touch with the blackboard and chalk, emphasizing the disease of progressivism. Finally, I'll highlight his points on personal responsibility and not penalizing success, using the required words.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the morally framed words without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point and moral word is included.
