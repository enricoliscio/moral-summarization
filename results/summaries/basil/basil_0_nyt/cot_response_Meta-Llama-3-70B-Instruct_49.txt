SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, the conservative hero, delivered a powerful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be cut out of the system. He aimed his fire at both Republicans and Democrats, saying the Republican Party has a "problem" and is "addicted to spending and big government." Beck emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, stating that individuals should not be "demonized or penalized" for their financial success. He also warned that the country is suffering from a "disease" - progressivism - which is eroding people's fundamental belief that things will get better. Beck's message was clear: it's time for Americans to take responsibility for their actions and stop making "mistakes" that burden others. The crowd was wowed by his speech, which was laced with personal anecdotes and humor. END OF SUMMARY.
