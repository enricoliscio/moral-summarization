SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, the conservative hero, delivered a powerful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He aimed his criticism at both Democrats and Republicans, saying the GOP had a "problem" with spending and big government, and needed to admit its "addiction". Beck emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, stating that individuals should not be "demonized or penalized" for their financial success. He also warned that people are losing faith that things will get better, and that the country is suffering from a "disease" - progressivism. Beck's message was clear: it's time for America to take responsibility for its mistakes and start anew. "It's still morning in America," he said, "but it's shaping up to be a nasty day."
