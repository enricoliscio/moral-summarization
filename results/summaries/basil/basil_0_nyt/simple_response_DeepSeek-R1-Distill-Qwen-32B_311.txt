Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing the author gave. The user provided the article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Beck is criticizing progressivism, calling it a cancer. He's also taking shots at both Republicans and Democrats, saying Republicans are addicted to spending and big government. He uses personal anecdotes, like his alcoholism recovery, to draw parallels to the party's problems. He also talks about the state of America, likening it to a hung-over morning, and emphasizes personal responsibility and financial success without demonization.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements. Beck is framing progressivism as a disease, which is a strong moral statement. He's also holding both parties accountable, which adds to the moral critique. His use of personal stories ties into his message about responsibility.

I should structure the summary to highlight his main arguments: the cancer metaphor for progressivism, the criticism of both parties, the personal responsibility angle, and his optimistic yet critical view of America's current state. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

I'll start by introducing Beck's role at CPAC, then move into his critique of progressivism and both parties. I'll include the personal responsibility part and his metaphor about America's morning. Ending with his call for change ties it all together.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure each sentence adds value and doesn't exceed the limit. Also, I'll ensure that the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the disease metaphor and the need for both parties to address their issues.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a fiery critique of progressivism, calling it a "cancer" that must be removed from America. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing the latter of failing to define their principles and being addicted to spending and big government. Drawing parallels to his own recovery from alcoholism, Beck urged the Republican Party to acknowledge its problems. He also faulted Democrats for their tax-and-spend policies, arguing that both parties share blame for eroding public faith in the future. Beck likened the current state of America to a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning," but maintained optimism, asserting it was still "morning in America." He emphasized personal responsibility and warned against demonizing financial success, declaring, "I’m not going to pay for your mistakes and I don’t expect you to pay for mine," which drew applause. Beck’s message was a moral call to action, urging Americans to reject progressivism and embrace accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
