SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, saying the latter had a spending problem and needed to admit it. Beck argued that people were losing faith in the system, but it was still "morning in America" despite the challenges. He identified progressivism as the root problem, rather than just blaming President Obama. Beck's speech emphasized personal responsibility, saying individuals should be free to pursue happiness without being penalized or demonized for their financial success. He received wild applause for his remarks, which were peppered with humorous anecdotes from his personal life.
