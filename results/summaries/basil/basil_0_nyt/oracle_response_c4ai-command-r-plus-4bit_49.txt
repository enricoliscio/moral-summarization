SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the hero of the political right, roused the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference with a scathing attack on progressivism, which he deemed a "cancer." He also took aim at both Republican and Democratic parties, criticizing their spending habits and lack of direction. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between the party's problems and addiction, stating, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!" He emphasized personal responsibility, asking, "Who can guarantee you happiness?" and asserting that success should not be "demonized or penalized." Beck captivated the audience with his blend of personal anecdotes and political philosophy, offering a stark diagnosis of the nation's problems while still holding onto a shred of optimism: "It is still morning in America... just a head-pounding, hungover kind of morning."
