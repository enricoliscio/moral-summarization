SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, the conservative hero, delivered a powerful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be cut out of the system. He aimed his criticism at both Republicans and Democrats, saying they are both to "blame" for the country's woes. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, likened the Republican Party to an addict, saying it's "addicted to spending and big government." He emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, asking "Who can guarantee you happiness?" and arguing that financial success should not be "demonized or penalized." Beck's message was clear: progressivism is the "disease" in America, and it's time for a change. The audience was left in awe, applauding his riffs on personal life and political philosophy.
