Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

So, Beck is the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He's criticizing progressivism, calling it a cancer that needs to be removed. He's not just targeting Democrats but also Republicans, saying they don't know what they stand for. He compares the Republican Party to someone with an addiction to spending and big government, which gets a good reaction from the crowd.

He mentions that both parties are to blame. Democrats tax and spend, while Republicans just spend. He talks about people losing faith that things will get better, using a metaphor about it being a rough morning in America. He questions why people feel so bad, suggesting it's not just Obama but progressivism itself as the real issue.

He uses his personal experiences, like being a recovering alcoholic, to emphasize the need for admitting problems. He also touches on personal responsibility and financial success, saying conservatives shouldn't be demonized for it. He ends with a strong statement about not paying for each other's mistakes, which gets a lot of applause.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: his criticism of progressivism, blame on both parties, the metaphor about America's morning, his personal analogy, and his emphasis on responsibility and success. I should make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence of his speech without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with who he is and where he spoke. Then mention his main criticism of progressivism and both parties. Include the metaphor about the morning in America. Add his personal analogy about addiction. Highlight his points on personal responsibility and financial success. End with the strong closing statement about not paying for each other's mistakes.

I should also keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Make sure it's within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200.

Okay, putting it all together now. Make sure each sentence is impactful and covers the main ideas without being too wordy. I think that's a solid plan for the summary.
