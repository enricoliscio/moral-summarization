SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck delivered a fiery speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be "cut out" of the system. He didn't spare Republicans, saying they're "addicted to spending and big government" and need to admit their problem. Beck argued that both parties are to blame, with Democrats "tax and spend" while Republicans just "spend." He warned that people are losing faith that things will get better, and that the country is "suffering" from progressivism. Beck emphasized personal responsibility, asking "Who can guarantee you happiness?" and stating that financial success shouldn't be "demonized or penalized." He received wild applause for his message, which emphasized individual accountability and limited government intervention. Beck's speech was a call to action, urging Americans to take control of their lives and reject the "disease" of progressivism. END OF SUMMARY.
