SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, a hero of the political right, delivered a rousing and morally charged speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Beck denounced progressivism as a *cancer* and a "disease" in America, blaming both Democrats and Republicans for the country's problems. He criticized the Democrats for taxing and spending, while condemning the Republicans for their big spending. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between his personal journey and the state of the Republican Party, urging it to admit its *mistakes* and addictions to spending and big government. He emphasized personal responsibility and financial success without *blame* or demonization. Beck captivated the audience with his passionate and morally infused address, highlighting the importance of individual happiness and accountability while rejecting the notion of penalizing success. He closed with a call for a renewed belief in a better America, despite the challenges faced. END OF SUMMARY.
