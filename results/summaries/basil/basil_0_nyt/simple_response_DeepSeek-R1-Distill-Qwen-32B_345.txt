Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on Beck's main points and the moral arguments he's making.

First, the article mentions that Beck is the closing speaker at CPAC, a conservative conference. He's criticizing progressivism, calling it a cancer. That's a strong moral statement, so I need to include that. He also criticizes both Republicans and Democrats, saying Republicans don't stand for much and are addicted to spending and big government. That's another key moral point.

He compares the current state of America to a hung-over morning, which is a vivid metaphor. I should note that as it conveys the sense of decline he's emphasizing. He also ties progressivism to the nation's problems, so that's an important moral critique.

Beck uses personal responsibility in his message, mentioning his own struggles and Tiger Woods' example. This ties into his conservative values, so I should highlight that aspect too.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first introduce Beck and the event, then outline his main criticisms, the metaphors he uses, and his emphasis on personal responsibility. Ending with the audience's reaction will show the impact of his message.

Let me piece this together, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward, making sure each sentence adds value to the summary.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a fiery critique of progressivism, calling it a "cancer" that must be removed from the system. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing the latter of lacking a clear identity and being addicted to spending and big government. Beck, who described himself as a "recovering alcoholic," urged the Republican Party to acknowledge its problems, likening its addiction to spending to a personal struggle. He argued that while Democrats tax and spend, Republicans simply spend, contributing to a national malaise. Beck painted a grim picture of America's current state, likening it to a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning," but insisted it was still "morning in America." He dismissed President Obama as a simplistic explanation for the nation's problems, instead blaming progressivism for the country's decline. Beck's message emphasized personal responsibility and conservative values, urging the audience to reject the idea that financial success should be demonized. His speech, filled with personal anecdotes and moral appeals, resonated strongly with the CPAC crowd, drawing cheers and applause. END OF SUMMARY.
