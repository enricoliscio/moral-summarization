Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally charged words provided: suck, spending, tax, spend, vomit, suffering, demonized, penalized. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Glenn Beck is speaking at CPAC, criticizing both Republicans and Democrats. He uses strong language, comparing progressivism to a cancer and likening the state of the country to a hung-over morning. He also talks about personal responsibility and not penalizing success.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start by highlighting Beck's main arguments against progressivism, using "cancer" as a metaphor. Then, I'll mention his criticism of Republicans for not standing for much and their addiction to spending. 

I should include the part where he compares the current state to a vomiting, hung-over morning, using "vomit" and "suffering" from the list. Also, his statement about not wanting to pay for others' mistakes ties in "demonized" and "penalized" when discussing financial success.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: start with his main message, move to his criticism of both parties, describe the state of the country, and end with his stance on personal responsibility and financial success. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while ensuring all key moral points are included.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is clear and captures the intensity of Beck's speech, using the specified moral terms naturally within the context.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at CPAC, delivered a fiery critique of progressivism, calling it a "cancer" that must be excised from the system. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing the latter of failing to stand for anything and being addicted to "spending" and "big government." Beck, a recovering alcoholic, likened the Republican Party to someone in denial, declaring, "Iâ€™m addicted to spending and big government," which drew cheers from the crowd. He argued that while Democrats "tax and spend," Republicans simply "spend," leaving Americans feeling hopeless. Beck painted the current state of the country as a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning in America," suggesting that the real issue is progressivism, not just President Obama. He emphasized personal responsibility, stating that financial success should not be "demonized" or "penalized," and urged the audience to take accountability for their own mistakes, rejecting the idea of being "penalized" for others' failures. END OF SUMMARY.
