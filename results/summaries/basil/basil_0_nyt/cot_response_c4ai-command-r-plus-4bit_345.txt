SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, a hero to the political right, delivered a passionate and morally charged address at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He decried progressivism as a "cancer" that needed to be excised, blaming both Democrats and Republicans for America's woes. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between the nation's struggles and his own personal journey towards responsibility and happiness. He argued that big government and excessive spending were the "problem" and "mistakes" that needed to be rectified. Beck energized the CPAC audience with his message of personal responsibility and his condemnation of progressivism, leaving a lasting impression of moral fervor. END OF SUMMARY.
