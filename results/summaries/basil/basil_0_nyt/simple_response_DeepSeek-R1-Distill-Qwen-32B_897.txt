Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC, criticizing progressivism and both political parties. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Beck is a prominent conservative figure, and he's addressing a conservative conference. He's denouncing progressivism as a cancer, which is a strong metaphor indicating a serious moral issue. He's also criticizing Republicans for not having clear principles and compares the party to an addict, which adds a moral failing aspect.

He contrasts the parties: Democrats tax and spend, Republicans just spend. He's pointing out a moral decay on both sides. He uses personal analogies, like his addiction, to make it relatable and emphasize the need for change. 

The article mentions that the audience responded positively, which shows the message resonated. Beck also talks about the state of the country, using a hung-over morning metaphor, indicating a moral low point but still holding hope.

I need to capture all these elements in a concise summary. I'll start by stating Beck's role and his main criticism of progressivism. Then mention his criticism of both parties, using the addiction analogy. Highlight the personal responsibility angle and the audience's reaction. Conclude with his hopeful message despite the current state.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll be brief but include all key moral points. Make sure the summary flows logically and reflects the original's moral framing.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, a prominent conservative figure, delivered a fiery speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be removed from the system. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing the latter of lacking clear principles and being addicted to spending and big government. Beck, drawing parallels to his own experience as a recovering alcoholic, urged the Republican Party to acknowledge its problems. He argued that while Democrats tax and spend, Republicans simply spend, contributing to the nation's decline in hope and belief in a better future. Beck humorously likened the current state of America to a "hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning," but emphasized that it was still morning, suggesting potential for change. He rejected simplistic blame on President Obama, instead pinpointing progressivism as the root cause. Beck intertwined his personal philosophy of responsibility, advocating for financial success without demonization and mutual accountability. His message, met with cheers and applause, highlighted a call for moral renewal and action. END OF SUMMARY.
