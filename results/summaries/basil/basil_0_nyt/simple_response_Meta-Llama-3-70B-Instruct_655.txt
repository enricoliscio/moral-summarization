SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, a conservative icon, delivered a powerful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, arguing that the latter's addiction to spending and big government is just as problematic as the former's tax-and-spend policies. Beck emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, saying that true happiness cannot be guaranteed by anyone, and that financial success should not be penalized. He also lamented that people are losing faith in the system, but maintained that it's still "morning in America" - albeit a difficult one. Beck's message was clear: progressivism is the root of the problem, and it's time for Americans to take responsibility for their own lives and demand change from their leaders.
