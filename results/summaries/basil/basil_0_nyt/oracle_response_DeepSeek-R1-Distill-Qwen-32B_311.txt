Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing words. The article is about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. I need to make sure I include the specific morally charged words they listed: suck, spending, tax, spend, vomit, suffering, demonized, penalized.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Beck is criticizing both Republicans and Democrats, calling progressivism a cancer. He uses personal analogies, like being a recovering alcoholic, to emphasize the need for Republicans to admit their problems with spending and big government. He also mocks the current state of America as a hung-over morning, which is a vivid metaphor. He blames progressivism for the nation's ills and emphasizes personal responsibility.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary. I should start by mentioning Beck's role as the closing speaker. Then, highlight his main criticisms: progressivism as a cancer, the Republican Party's addiction to spending, and the comparison to a hung-over morning. I should include the specific words like "suck," "spending," "vomit," and "suffering." Also, mention his points about personal responsibility and not penalizing success.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but include all key points. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the moral tone without being too verbose.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce Beck and the event, his main criticism of progressivism, the metaphor about the hung-over morning, the Republican's spending problem, the critique of both parties, the call for personal responsibility, and the conclusion about not penalizing success.

I'll check each sentence to ensure the moral words are included naturally. For example, "Republicans'suck' as much as Democrats" uses "suck." "Addicted to spending" uses "spending." The hung-over metaphor includes "vomit." The part about suffering from progressivism uses "suffering." Finally, the part about not being demonized or penalized uses those words.

I think that covers all the required elements. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and flows logically.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a fiery critique of progressivism, calling it a "cancer" that must be removed from the system. He criticized both Republicans and Democrats, accusing Republicans of being "addicted to spending and big government" and Democrats of "tax and spend" policies. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, likened the Republican Party to someone in denial, saying, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!" He mocked the current state of America as a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning," suggesting the nation is "suffering" from progressivism. Beck emphasized personal responsibility, arguing that financial success should not be "demonized or penalized." He also rejected simplistic blame on President Obama, instead pointing to progressivism as the root cause of the nation's woes. His message resonated with the crowd, who cheered his call for accountability and a return to conservative principles. END OF SUMMARY.
