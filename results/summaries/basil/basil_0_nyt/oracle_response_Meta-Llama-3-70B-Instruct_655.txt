SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck delivered a powerful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be cut out of the system. He didn't spare Republicans, saying they're addicted to "spending and big government" and need to admit they have a problem. Beck argued that both parties are to blame, with Democrats "tax and spend" and Republicans just "spend". He lamented that people are losing faith that things will get better, likening America's current state to a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning". Beck identified progressivism as the root of the problem, emphasizing personal responsibility and warning against being "demonized or penalized" for financial success. He received wild applause for his message, urging individuals to take ownership of their mistakes and not expect others to pay for them.
