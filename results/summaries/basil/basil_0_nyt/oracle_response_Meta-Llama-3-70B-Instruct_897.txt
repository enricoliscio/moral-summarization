SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, the conservative icon, delivered a scathing critique of progressivism at the Conservative Political Action Conference, likening it to a "cancer" that must be eradicated. He didn't spare Republicans, either, saying they're "addicted to spending and big government." Beck declared, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!" The problem, he argued, is that both parties are guilty of "taxing and spending" or just "spending," leading to a loss of faith in the system. Beck posited that the real issue is progressivism, which he wrote on his signature blackboard, saying "This is the disease in America." He emphasized personal responsibility, asking, "Who can guarantee you happiness?" and stating that conservatives believe success shouldn't be "demonized or penalized." The crowd erupted in applause as Beck concluded, "I'm not going to pay for your mistakes and I don't expect you to pay for my mistakes."
