SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, the conservative hero, delivered a powerful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He held both parties accountable, saying Republicans are "addicted to spending and big government." Beck emphasized the importance of personal "responsibility" and warned that progressivism is a "disease" in America. He argued that financial success should not be "demonized or penalized" and that individuals should be accountable for their own "mistakes." Beck's message resonated with the audience, who cheered and applauded his call to action. He concluded that despite the current state of America being a "nasty" morning, it is still morning, and there is hope for a better future. END OF SUMMARY.
