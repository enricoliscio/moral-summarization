Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article about Glenn Beck's speech at CPAC. The user has provided specific instructions: the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.", and it should be under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Glenn Beck is the closing speaker at CPAC, a conservative conference. He criticized progressivism, calling it a cancer. He also took aim at both Republicans and Democrats, saying Republicans don't know what they stand for and have a problem with spending and big government. He used personal analogies, like his recovery from alcoholism, to make his points. He also criticized Obama but pointed to progressivism as the real issue. His speech included personal responsibility and financial success themes.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I should mention who he is, the event, his main criticisms, the parties he criticized, his personal analogies, and the overall message about progressivism. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting into too much detail.

I should start with his role at CPAC, then his main message about progressivism. Then, mention his criticism of both parties, using his personal analogy. Highlight his points about personal responsibility and financial success. Conclude with the overall impact of his speech.

Let me structure it: opening with his role and the event, then his main criticism of progressivism, followed by his critique of Republicans and Democrats, using his personal analogy. Then, touch on his themes of personal responsibility and financial success. Finally, mention the audience's reaction and the overall message.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all main points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I draft to make sure it's concise.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a fiery speech denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be removed from America. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing the latter of failing to define their principles and being addicted to spending and big government. Drawing parallels to his own recovery from alcoholism, Beck urged the Republican Party to acknowledge its problems. He also criticized Democrats for taxing and spending, while Republicans simply spent without addressing the root issues. Beck blamed progressivism for the nation's challenges, calling it a disease, and questioned the belief that America's future will improve. He emphasized personal responsibility and financial success, arguing that individuals should not be penalized for their achievements. His speech, filled with personal anecdotes and humor, resonated with the audience, who responded with cheers and applause. Beck's message was a call to action for conservatives to reject progressivism and focus on core values. END OF SUMMARY.
