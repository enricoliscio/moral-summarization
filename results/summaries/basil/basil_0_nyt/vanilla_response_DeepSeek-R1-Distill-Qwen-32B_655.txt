Alright, I need to summarize this article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. Let me read through it carefully.

So, Beck is the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He's denouncing progressivism, calling it a cancer that needs to be removed. He's criticizing both Democrats and Republicans. For the Republicans, he's saying they don't know what they stand for and are addicted to spending and big government. That got a big reaction from the crowd.

He also compares the current state of America to a hung-over morning, which is a vivid metaphor. He's pointing out that both parties are to blame, with Democrats taxing and spending, and Republicans just spending without the taxes. He's emphasizing personal responsibility and conservative values, like not penalizing success.

He used personal anecdotes, like his recovery from alcoholism, to draw parallels to the party's need to admit their problems. The audience loved it, especially when he said they should take responsibility for their mistakes without expecting others to pay for them.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the main points: his criticism of progressivism, both parties, the metaphor about America's state, and his emphasis on personal responsibility and conservative values. Also, mention the audience's reaction and his personal touch with the recovery analogy.

Let me structure it: Start with who he is and where he spoke. Then his main criticisms, the metaphor, the parties' faults, his call for responsibility, and the audience's response. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear without going into too much detail.

Okay, putting it all together. Make sure it flows well and covers all key points within the word limit.
