SUMMARY:

Conservative speaker Glenn Beck addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday, delivering a scathing critique of progressivism and calling it a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. Beck aimed his criticism at both Democrats and Republicans, saying the GOP had lost its way and was addicted to spending and big government. He argued that people were losing faith in the system and that both parties were to blame for the country's problems. Beck's speech was peppered with personal anecdotes and humor, as he emphasized the importance of personal responsibility and individual freedom. He rejected the idea that government could guarantee happiness, citing examples like Tiger Woods, and instead advocated for a system where individuals were free to succeed or fail without being penalized or demonized.
