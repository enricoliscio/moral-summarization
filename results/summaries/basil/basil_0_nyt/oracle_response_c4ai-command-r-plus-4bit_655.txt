SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the hero of the political right, delivered a rousing and morally charged speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), denouncing progressivism as a cancer. He spared neither Republicans nor Democrats from his fiery critique, arguing that both parties are to blame for the nation's woes. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between the party's problems and addiction, declaring, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem! I'm addicted to spending and big government." He decried the spending and taxing habits of Democrats and the spending-without-taxing habits of Republicans. Beck also touched on the loss of optimism in America, likening it to a hangover-ridden morning filled with vomiting and suffering. He questioned the cause of this suffering, refusing to simply blame President Obama. Instead, he identified progressivism as "the disease in America." Beck emphasized personal responsibility, arguing that conservatives believe in financial success without demonization or penalization. He concluded with a powerful statement: "I'm not going to pay for your mistakes, and I don't expect you to pay for my mistakes." END OF SUMMARY.
