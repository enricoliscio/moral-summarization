Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Beck is criticizing progressivism, comparing it to a cancer. He's also taking shots at both Democrats and Republicans, saying they're both to blame for the country's issues. He mentions that Republicans are addicted to spending and big government, which got a good reaction from the crowd.

I should note that he uses personal anecdotes, like his recovery from alcoholism, to make his points about the Republican Party needing to admit their problems. He also touches on personal responsibility and economic policies, saying people shouldn't be penalized for their success. The article ends with his statement about the current state of America being rough but still hopeful.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key points: his criticism of progressivism, the blame on both parties, his personal analogy, the focus on personal responsibility, and his optimistic yet critical view of the country's state. I'll structure it clearly, starting with his main argument, then his critique of both parties, his personal touch, and ending with his message about the morning in America. Keeping it concise but informative is key here.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), criticized progressivism as a "cancer" that must be removed from the system. He also sharply condemned both Republicans and Democrats, accusing Republicans of being addicted to spending and big government. Beck, who described himself as a recovering alcoholic, urged the party to acknowledge its problems, likening it to a person in recovery. He argued that Democrats tax and spend, while Republicans just spend, leading to a loss of faith in the country's future. Despite the challenges, Beck maintained that "itâ€™s still morning in America," though a difficult one. He criticized President Obama as an oversimplified explanation for the nation's problems, attributing the real issue to progressivism. Beck emphasized personal responsibility and economic freedom, asserting that individuals should not be penalized for financial success. His speech, filled with personal anecdotes and political philosophy, resonated strongly with the audience. END OF SUMMARY.
