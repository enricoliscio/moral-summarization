SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the hero of the political right, delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he vehemently denounced progressivism as a "cancer" that needs to be excised from the system. With his signature chalkboard, he scrawled the word "progressivism," declaring it to be the disease afflicting America. He took aim at both Democrats and Republicans, criticizing their spending habits and lack of direction. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew parallels between the party's problems and his own personal struggles, stating, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem! I'm addicted to spending and big government." He emphasized personal responsibility and financial success without demonization or penalization, stating, "I'm not going to pay for your mistakes, and I don't expect you to pay for mine." His speech captivated the audience, who cheered and applauded his every word. Beck's message was clear: it's still morning in America, but we must address the disease of progressivism to ensure a brighter future. END OF SUMMARY.
