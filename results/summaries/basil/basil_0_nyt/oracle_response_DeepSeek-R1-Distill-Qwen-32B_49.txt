Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words listed are: suck, spending, tax, spend, vomit, suffering, demonized, penalized.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Glenn Beck is speaking at CPAC, criticizing progressivism as a cancer. He's also criticizing both Republicans and Democrats. He mentions that Republicans are addicted to spending and big government, which is a key point. He uses the metaphor of "morning in America" but describes it as hung-over and vomiting, which are strong moral terms.

I need to make sure to include words like "suck," "spending," "tax," "spend," "vomit," "suffering," "demonized," and "penalized." I should structure the summary to highlight Beck's main criticisms and his use of these terms.

I should start by mentioning Beck's role as the closing speaker and his main message about progressivism. Then, I'll note his criticism of both parties, using "spending" and "tax" as part of that. I'll include the metaphor about the morning in America, using "vomit" and "suffering." Finally, I'll touch on his points about personal responsibility and not demonizing success.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating all the necessary moral terms. I should avoid adding any new information not in the article and stick to the key points Beck made.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each of the moral words is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll present it as the user requested, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at CPAC, condemned progressivism as a cancer in America, likening it to a disease that must be excised. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing Republicans of being addicted to spending and big government, and questioning their values. Beck humorously declared, "It’s still morning in America," but described it as a hung-over, vomiting kind of morning, suggesting widespread suffering. He blamed progressivism for the nation’s problems, not just President Obama, and emphasized personal responsibility. Beck argued that financial success should not be demonized or penalized, urging accountability for one’s mistakes. His fiery rhetoric, filled with morally charged terms like "suck," "spend," "vomit," and "demonized," resonated with the crowd, who cheered his call for change. END OF SUMMARY.
