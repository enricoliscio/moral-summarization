SUMMARY:
Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a rousing and morally charged address to the crowd. Beck decried progressivism as a "cancer" and a "disease" plaguing America, blaming both Democrats and Republicans for the nation's woes. He likened the Republican Party to a "recovering alcoholic," admitting its "addiction to spending and big government." Beck emphasized personal responsibility, asking who can guarantee happiness and pointing to Tiger Woods as an example of someone who, despite success, was unhappy. He argued that conservatives believe individuals should not be "demonized or penalized" for finding financial success on the road to happiness. Beck also highlighted the shared responsibility of citizens, stating his refusal to "pay for your mistakes" and expecting the same in return. The audience enthusiastically received his message, applauding his stance on personal accountability and small government. Beck's speech struck a chord by addressing the moral framework of American politics and the role of individuals and parties in shaping the nation's future.
