Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Glenn Beck speaking at CPAC. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

Glenn Beck is the closing speaker at CPAC. He criticized progressivism, calling it a cancer. He also criticized both Republicans and Democrats, saying Republicans don't stand for much and are addicted to spending. He used personal analogies, like being a recovering alcoholic, to make his points. He talked about the state of America, using metaphors about a hung-over morning. He also discussed personal responsibility and happiness, referencing Tiger Woods.

The moral words to include are: suck, spending, tax, spend, vomit, suffering, demonized, penalized. I need to make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by introducing Beck and his role. Then mention his criticism of progressivism as a cancer. Note that he criticized both parties, using the terms'spending' and 'tax' and'spend'. Mention his personal analogy with the Republican Party having a problem. Include the metaphor about the morning in America and the vomiting part. Then touch on the deeper issues beyond Obama, the personal responsibility angle, and the part about not paying for each other's mistakes. Finally, wrap it up by highlighting his strong message against progressivism.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point and moral word is included without making it too long. I'll avoid adding any extra information beyond what's necessary to preserve the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the closing speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), delivered a fiery critique of progressivism, calling it a "cancer" that must be excised from the system. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, accusing the latter of being "addicted to spending and big government" and failing to define their principles. Beck, who described himself as a "recovering alcoholic," urged the Republican Party to admit its problems, quipping, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!" He likened the current state of America to a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning," suggesting that the nation's issues go beyond President Obama. Beck blamed progressivism for the country's suffering, stating it was a "disease" in America. He emphasized personal responsibility, arguing that financial success should not be "demonized or penalized," and declared, "I’m not going to pay for your mistakes and I don’t expect you to pay for mine." His speech, filled with personal anecdotes and moral framing, left the crowd spellbound and cheering. END OF SUMMARY.
