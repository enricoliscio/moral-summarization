SUMMARY:

Glenn Beck, the conservative icon, delivered a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, denouncing progressivism as a "cancer" that must be eradicated from the system. He didn't spare Republicans, saying they're addicted to "spending and big government" and need to admit their problem. Beck declared, "Hello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem! I'm addicted to spending and big government." He criticized both parties, saying Democrats "tax and spend" while Republicans just "spend." Beck warned that people are losing faith that things will get better, saying it's "still morning in America," but a "head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning." He argued that the real problem is progressivism, not President Obama, and that personal responsibility is key. Beck emphasized that financial success shouldn't be "demonized or penalized" and that individuals should be accountable for their own mistakes.
