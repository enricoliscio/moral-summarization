SUMMARY: Glenn Beck, the hero of the political right, roused the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference with a passionate and moral-framed denunciation of progressivism. Beck, a recovering alcoholic himself, drew parallels between the Republican Party and addiction, stating that the party needed to admit its problems with spending and big government. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans, blaming them for the country's problems. "It's still morning in America," he said, "but it's a head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting kind of morning." Beck emphasized personal responsibility, asking who could guarantee happiness and pointing to Tiger Woods as an example. He rallied against being "demonized" or "penalized" for financial success, refusing to "pay for your mistakes." His speech, filled with moral framing, energized the conservative audience and reinforced their beliefs. END OF SUMMARY.
