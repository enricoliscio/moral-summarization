SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating a presidential debate, but this may not be the last we see of him in politics. In fact, Republicans may have inadvertently given him more leverage by shunning him. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the "right Republican candidate" is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration." However, if he's not pleased with the candidates, he's willing to run as an independent. Trump faced criticism for considering a presidential run while moderating a debate. Instead of committing to not run, he chose to drop the debate, saying he must "leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!" The debate was already in jeopardy, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to participate. Trump's withdrawal may have saved him from an awkward situation, but it's clear he's not ready to fade into the background.

END OF SUMMARY.
