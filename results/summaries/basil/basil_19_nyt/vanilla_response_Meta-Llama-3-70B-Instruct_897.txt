SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not ruling out a potential independent run for president. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the right Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the Obama administration, but if he's not pleased with the candidates, he may run as an independent. Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential run while moderating a debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, while others declined, damaging Trump's reputation as a Republican kingmaker. Trump's statement emphasized the importance of keeping his options open to "make America great again!" This move may lead to another round of threats from Trump about running as an independent candidate.

END OF SUMMARY.
