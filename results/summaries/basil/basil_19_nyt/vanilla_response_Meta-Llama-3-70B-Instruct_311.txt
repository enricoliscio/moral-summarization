SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating a presidential debate, but hinted that he may still run as an independent candidate if he is not satisfied with the Republican nominee. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the right candidate is chosen to defeat the Obama administration, but will not rule out an independent run if necessary. The decision comes after Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential bid while moderating a debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, leading to a potentially awkward situation for Trump. Trump's statement emphasized the need to "make America great again" and left the door open for a potential independent candidacy. This move may have given Republicans more to deal with than they anticipated, as Trump's influence and popularity remain significant.

END OF SUMMARY.
