Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first. 

So, the article is about Donald Trump dropping out of moderating a presidential debate. He's not going to fade away politically, though. The Republicans might have issues because they shunned him. Trump said he's stepping back from the Newsmax debate but might run as an independent if the Republican candidate isn't right for him. 

He's criticizing the Republican establishment for letting him moderate the debate while he's considering running. Instead of moderating and saying he won't run, he dropped the debate. He wants to keep his options open to make America great again. 

Also, only two candidates, Gingrich and Santorum, agreed to attend, which hurt Trump's image as a kingmaker. The article ends with Trump issuing a statement through his lawyer, Michael Cohen.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump dropping the debate, his potential run as an independent, criticism from Republicans, the awkward situation with only two candidates, and his lawyer's statement. 

I'll start by stating Trump dropped plans to moderate. Then mention his possible independent run. Note the criticism from Republicans. Explain the awkwardness with only two attendees. Highlight the impact on his kingmaker status. End with his statement through his lawyer.

I should make sure the summary is concise and covers all key points without going into too much detail. Also, ensure it's under 200 words and ends with the specified tokens.
