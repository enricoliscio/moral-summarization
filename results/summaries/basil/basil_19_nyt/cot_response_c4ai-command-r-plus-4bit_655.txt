SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump has decided not to moderate a presidential debate, but his statement hints at the possibility of him running as an independent candidate if he is displeased with the Republican nominee. Mr. Trump's decision comes after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for his intention to moderate a debate while keeping the option of running for president himself open. He stated that his priority is to ensure the defeat of the failed Obama administration and that the right Republican candidate is chosen. However, if that candidate does not meet his expectations, he is unwilling to give up his right to run independently. Mr. Trump's statement opens the door to further speculation and threats of a potential run, which he has flirted with several times in the past. The decision to drop the debate was likely influenced by the fact that only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreed to participate, diminishing Mr. Trump's potential as a Republican kingmaker. Mr. Trump's focus on "making America great again" suggests a continued interest in playing a significant role in the political scene. END OF SUMMARY.
