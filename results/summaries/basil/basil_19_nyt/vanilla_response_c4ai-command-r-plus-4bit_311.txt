SUMMARY: Despite bowing out of moderating a presidential debate, Donald Trump continues to tease a potential independent presidential bid. In a statement, Trump cited his dissatisfaction with the Republican candidates and his desire to "make America great again" as reasons for keeping his options open. The statement came after Trump faced criticism for his intentions to moderate a debate while also considering an independent run. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend the debate, while other Republican candidates declined, damaging Trump's reputation as a kingmaker. Trump's decision to drop the debate and potentially run as an independent adds further uncertainty to the Republican race.
END OF SUMMARY.
