SUMMARY: Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a Republican presidential debate, citing his desire to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. Despite criticism from the Republican establishment, Trump has refused to rule out a run for president and continues to flirt with the idea. In his statement, Trump emphasized the importance of choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat President Obama, but also asserted that he may run if he feels the Republican candidate is not suitable. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreed to participate in the debate, while others declined, diminishing Trump's self-proclaimed status as a kingmaker. Trump's statement, issued through his lawyer, highlighted his belief in the need to "make America great again."

END OF SUMMARY.
