SUMMARY: Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but his statement suggests he may continue to threaten to run as an independent candidate if the Republican Party does not choose a candidate to his liking. Mr. Trump's decision to back out of the debate, which only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend, may be a result of criticism he faced from the Republican establishment for his indecisiveness and self-proclaimed kingmaker status. Despite his history of flirting with but never committing to a presidential run, Mr. Trump continues to dangle the possibility of an independent candidacy, a move that could potentially harm the Republican Party. His statement emphasizes his belief in the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat President Obama, and his willingness to exercise his "right to run" if he deems the chosen candidate unsuitable. This development underscores the moral dilemma faced by the Republican Party, as Mr. Trump's potential independent candidacy could divide the party and impact the outcome of the election. END OF SUMMARY.
