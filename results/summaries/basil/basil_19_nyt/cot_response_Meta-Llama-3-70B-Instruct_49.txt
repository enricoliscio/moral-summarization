SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In a statement, Trump emphasized that it's "very important" to him that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed" and "very destructive" Obama administration. However, if he's not pleased with the candidate, he's "not willing" to give up his right to run as an independent. Trump's decision comes after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating a debate while considering a presidential run. With only two candidates agreeing to participate, Trump chose to drop the debate, saying he must "leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!" Trump's move may have given him more leverage in the political scene, and Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him. END OF SUMMARY.
