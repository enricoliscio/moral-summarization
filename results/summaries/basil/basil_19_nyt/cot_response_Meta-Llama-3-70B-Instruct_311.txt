SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In a statement, Trump emphasized the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat the "failed" and "destructive" Obama administration. However, he refused to rule out an independent run, saying he's not "willing" to give up his right to run if he's displeased with the candidates. Trump's decision to drop the debate came after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating while openly considering a presidential bid. With only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreeing to participate, Trump's self-proclaimed status as Republican kingmaker took a hit. Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, issued a statement saying Trump must "leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!"
