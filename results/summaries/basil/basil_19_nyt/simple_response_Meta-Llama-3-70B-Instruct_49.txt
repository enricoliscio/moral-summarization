SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a presidential debate, but warns that he may still run as an independent candidate if he's not satisfied with the Republican nominee. Trump's decision comes after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential bid while moderating a debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, while others declined, damaging Trump's self-proclaimed status as a Republican kingmaker. Trump's statement emphasized the importance of defeating the "failed and very destructive Obama administration" and his desire to "make America great again." By leaving his options open, Trump is sending a message that he's not willing to fade into the background, and may yet again threaten to disrupt the political scene.

END OF SUMMARY.
