Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump dropping out of moderating a presidential debate. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says Trump decided not to moderate the Newsmax debate. He's not leaving the political scene quietly. Republicans might have more issues because they shunned him. Trump's statement mentions he wants the right Republican candidate to beat Obama, but if he doesn't think that candidate is right, he might run as an independent. He's criticized for possibly running while moderating the debate. Instead of holding the debate, he dropped it. He's leaving his options open to make America great again. He was in a tough spot because only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were attending, others declined, which hurt his image as a kingmaker. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, released the statement with lots of exclamation points.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump dropping the debate, his possible independent run, criticism from Republicans, the awkward situation with only two attendees, and the impact on his reputation. Also, mention his lawyer releasing the statement.

I'll structure it by first stating Trump's decision, then his reasons, the criticism, the debate's low turnout, and the lawyer's statement. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

Let me check the word count to stay under 200. I think that's manageable. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the key elements.
