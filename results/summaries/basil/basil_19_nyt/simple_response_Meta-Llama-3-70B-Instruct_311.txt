SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped out of moderating a presidential debate, but warns that he may still run as an independent candidate if he's not pleased with the Republican nominee. Trump's statement emphasized his commitment to making America great again, implying that he's willing to take drastic measures to achieve this goal. The move comes after Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential run while moderating a debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, while others declined, damaging Trump's reputation as a Republican kingmaker. Trump's decision to drop out of the debate may be seen as a tactical move to keep his options open and maintain his influence in the political scene.
