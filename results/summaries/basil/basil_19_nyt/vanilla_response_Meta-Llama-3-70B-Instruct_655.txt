SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped out of moderating a presidential debate, but has not ruled out running as an independent candidate. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the right Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the Obama administration, but if he's not satisfied, he may run independently. This decision comes after Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering moderating a debate while still flirting with a presidential run. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, leading to a potentially awkward situation for Trump. By dropping out of the debate, Trump avoids having to declare that he won't run for president, keeping his options open. Trump has a history of considering presidential runs, but has always ultimately decided not to follow through.

END OF SUMMARY.
