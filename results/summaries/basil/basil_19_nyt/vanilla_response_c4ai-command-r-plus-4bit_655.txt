SUMMARY: Donald Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate, stating that he wants to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. Trump's statement suggests that he may still enter the race if he feels the Republican candidate is not suitable to defeat President Obama. The decision comes after criticism from the Republican establishment for his public consideration of a presidential run while moderating a debate. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to participate in the debate, while other candidates declined, diminishing the potential impact of Trump's involvement. Trump's statement, delivered through his lawyer, emphasizes his desire to see a Republican victory in 2012, but also highlights his willingness to run independently if he feels the need to "make America great again." 

END OF SUMMARY.
