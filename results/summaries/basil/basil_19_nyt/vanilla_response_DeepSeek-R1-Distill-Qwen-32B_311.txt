Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about Donald Trump dropping out of moderating a Republican presidential debate. He's not fading away, though. The Republicans might have issues because they pushed him away. Trump made a statement saying he wants the right candidate to defeat Obama, but if he doesn't like the chosen one, he might run as an independent. That's a big deal because he's threatening to split the party.

He was criticized for trying to moderate while still possibly running. Instead of doing the debate and saying he won't run, he backed out. He left all options open to make America great again. The debate only had two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, while others like Romney and Perry declined. This weakened Trump's image as a kingmaker in the party.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump dropping the debate, his potential run as an independent, the criticism, the awkward situation with few attendees, and the impact on his influence.

I should structure it clearly, starting with his decision, the implications, the criticism, and the debate's low turnout. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit.
