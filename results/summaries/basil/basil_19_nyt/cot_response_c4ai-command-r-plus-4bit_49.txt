STEP 1:
*Shunning*
*Threats*
*Displeased*
*Awkward*

SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a Republican presidential debate, citing his desire to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. This decision comes after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for his ambiguous intentions. Mr. Trump suggested he might run for president if he was *displeased* with the Republican candidates, and his decision to back out of the debate may fuel further *threats* of an independent bid. 

Mr. Trump framed his decision around his patriotism and the need to "make America great again," insinuating that the current Republican candidates might not be up to the task of defeating President Obama. However, the planned debate faced an *awkward* prospect with only two candidates agreeing to attend, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. The absence of front-runners like Mitt Romney and Rick Perry dealt a blow to Mr. Trump's aspirations as a Republican kingmaker. 

Mr. Trump's statement, laden with patriotic rhetoric and exclamation points, underscores his intent to remain a political force, potentially as an independent candidate. This development leaves Republicans with the dilemma of whether to embrace or continue *shunning* Mr. Trump, whose influence could be a double-edged sword in the upcoming election. 

END OF SUMMARY.
