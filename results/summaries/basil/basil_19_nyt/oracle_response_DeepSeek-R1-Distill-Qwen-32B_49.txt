Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: "failed," "destructive," and "great." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is dropping out of moderating a debate but isn't leaving politics. Republicans might regret shunning him. He might run as an independent if he doesn't like the Republican candidate. He criticized Obama's administration as failed and destructive. He emphasized making America great again. Only two candidates agreed to the debate, which weakened his position as a kingmaker.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with Trump dropping the debate but staying in the political scene. Mention his possible run as an independent if the Republican candidate isn't right. Include his criticism of Obama's administration using "failed" and "destructive." Highlight his commitment to making America great. Note the low turnout for the debate, showing his diminished influence.

I need to keep it under 200 words and include all three moral words. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the key points without adding extra information.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating a presidential debate, signaling his continued presence in the political arena. His decision leaves Republicans potentially facing an unexpected challenge, as Trump hinted at running as an independent if he deems the Republican candidate unfit to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. Trump emphasized his commitment to "making America great again," leaving all options open. His withdrawal came as only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreed to attend the debate, undermining Trump's self-proclaimed role as a Republican kingmaker. END OF SUMMARY.
