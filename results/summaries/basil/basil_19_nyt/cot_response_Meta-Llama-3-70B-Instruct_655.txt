SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In a statement, Trump said it's "very important" to him that the "right" Republican candidate is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive" Obama administration. However, if he's not pleased with the candidates, he's not "willing" to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. Trump's decision comes after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating a debate while considering a presidential run. With only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreeing to participate, Trump chose to drop the debate, saying he must "leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!" Trump's move may have opened the door to another round of threats to run as an independent candidate. END OF SUMMARY.
