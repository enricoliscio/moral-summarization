STEP 1:
*Shunning*
*Criticism*
*Awkward*

SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump has abandoned his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but his statement on Tuesday suggests he may not be leaving the political scene quietly. Mr. Trump's decision to drop the debate seems to be a strategic move to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. He stated that he wants to ensure the right Republican candidate is chosen to defeat President Obama, but if that candidate does not meet his approval, he reserves the right to run himself. Mr. Trump has faced *criticism* from the Republican establishment for his ambiguous role in the election process, and the debate he planned to moderate was becoming *awkward* as only two candidates agreed to attend. Rather than back down, Mr. Trump chose to maintain his political leverage by keeping his options open. This move highlights his influence in the Republican Party and his potential to shape the upcoming election, either as a moderator or a candidate. Mr. Trump's statement underscores his belief that his involvement is crucial to "make America great again."
