STEP 1:
*Shunning
Awkward
Criticism
Displeased
Flirted*

SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate, but this may not be the last we hear of his political ambitions. Mr. Trump's statement on the matter hinted at the possibility of him running as an independent candidate if he is *displeased* with the Republican nominee. This move comes after Mr. Trump faced *criticism* from the Republican establishment for his intention to moderate a debate while keeping the option of running for president himself open. 

Mr. Trump's statement, issued through his lawyer, emphasized the importance of defeating "the failed and destructive Obama administration," but also highlighted his desire to "leave all options open" to "make America great again." The prospect of moderating a debate with only two confirmed attendees, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, may have contributed to Mr. Trump's decision to step down. The task could have been *awkward*, especially since prominent candidates such as Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., and Ron Paul all declined the invitation. 

Mr. Trump has a history of *flirtation* with running for president, and this time is no exception. His refusal to moderate the debate and his insistence on keeping his options open suggest that he may be more seriously considering a run than ever before. Only time will tell if Mr. Trump will make good on his threat to run as an independent, but Republicans may have inadvertently encouraged him by *shunning* his initial involvement.
END OF SUMMARY.
