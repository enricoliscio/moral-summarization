SUMMARY: Donald Trump has abandoned plans to moderate a Republican presidential debate, stating that he wants to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. Mr. Trump's decision comes after facing criticism for considering a run while moderating the debate. In his statement, he emphasized the importance of choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat President Obama but left the door open for an independent bid if he deems the Republican nominee unsuitable. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend the debate, while other leading candidates declined, diminishing the event's significance. Mr. Trump's statement, issued through his lawyer, highlighted his desire to "make America great again," indicating that he may continue to play a role in the political arena.
