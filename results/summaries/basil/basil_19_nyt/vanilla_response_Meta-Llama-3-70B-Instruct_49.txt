SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but has hinted that he may still run as an independent candidate if he's not pleased with the Republican nominee. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the right candidate is chosen to defeat the Obama administration, but if not, he won't rule out an independent run. This comes after Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential bid while moderating a debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, while others declined, damaging Trump's reputation as a Republican kingmaker. Trump's decision to drop the debate may be a strategic move to keep his options open and maintain his influence in the political scene.

END OF SUMMARY.
