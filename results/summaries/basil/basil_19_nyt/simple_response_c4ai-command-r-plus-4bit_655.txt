SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul and perennial flirtation with a presidential run, has dropped his plans to moderate a Republican presidential debate, citing his desire to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. This move comes after criticism from the Republican establishment for his refusal to rule out a run and his self-proclaimed status as a kingmaker. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreed to attend the debate, while others declined, dealing a blow to Mr. Trump's influence. In his statement, Mr. Trump emphasized the importance of defeating President Obama and his dissatisfaction with the current Republican field. He threatened an independent bid, stating that he must "leave all [his] options open" to "make America great again." Mr. Trump's decision opens the door to further speculation about his political ambitions and the potential impact on the Republican race.
