SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump has abandoned his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but his statement on Tuesday suggests he may continue to threaten to run as an independent candidate if the Republican nominee does not meet his approval. Mr. Trump characterized the Obama administration as "failed and very destructive" and emphasized his desire to "make America great again." He faced criticism for his potential conflict of interest in moderating the debate while maintaining the option to run himself, and his decision to drop out of the debate may have been influenced by the low number of candidates planning to attend. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to participate, while several other prominent Republicans declined, undermining Mr. Trump's ambition to be a Republican kingmaker. Mr. Trump's statement, released through his lawyer, highlighted his intention to keep his options open and shape the direction of the Republican Party.
END OF SUMMARY.
