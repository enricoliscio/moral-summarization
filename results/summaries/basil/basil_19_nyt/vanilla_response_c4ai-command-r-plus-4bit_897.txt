SUMMARY: Donald Trump has abandoned plans to moderate a Republican presidential debate, citing his desire to keep his options open for a potential independent candidacy. Despite facing criticism from the Republican establishment, Trump emphasized his commitment to ensuring the defeat of the "failed and destructive" Obama administration. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to participate in the debate, while other leading candidates declined, diminishing Trump's influence as a self-proclaimed kingmaker. In a statement, Trump hinted at the possibility of an independent run if the Republican candidate fails to meet his expectations. He emphasized the need to "make America great again," suggesting that his political ambitions remain intact. Trump's decision to drop the debate moderation may fuel further speculation about his intentions and could potentially impact the Republican race.
END OF SUMMARY.
