Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: "failed," "destructive," and "great." The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Trump is dropping out of moderating a debate but hasn't ruled out running as an independent. He criticized the Obama administration as "failed" and "destructive." He emphasized making America "great" again. The Republican establishment criticized him for considering running while moderating. Only two candidates agreed to the debate, which weakened his influence.

I'll structure the summary to include these elements, making sure to use the moral terms. I'll mention Trump's withdrawal, his potential independent run, criticism of Obama, the importance of making America great, the criticism from Republicans, and the low turnout for the debate. I'll keep it under 200 words and ensure it flows well.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating a Newsmax presidential debate, leaving the door open for a potential independent run if he deems the Republican candidate unsuitable. He criticized the Obama administration as "failed" and "destructive," emphasizing the need to "make America great again." Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a run while moderating the debate. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to participate, undermining Trump's self-proclaimed role as a Republican kingmaker. His decision to step back keeps his options open, signaling continued influence in the political arena. END OF SUMMARY.
