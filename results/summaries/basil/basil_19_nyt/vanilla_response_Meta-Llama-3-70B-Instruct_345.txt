SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but has hinted that he may still run as an independent candidate if he is not satisfied with the Republican nominee. Trump had faced criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential bid while moderating a debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, had agreed to participate in the debate, while others had declined. Trump stated that he must keep his options open to "make America great again." This move may not signal the end of Trump's political ambitions, as he has a history of flirting with presidential runs. Trump's decision to drop the debate may have been influenced by the lack of participation from top Republican candidates.

END OF SUMMARY.
