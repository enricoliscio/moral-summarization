SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump has abandoned his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but has hinted at the possibility of running as an independent candidate if the Republican candidate is "not the right candidate" to defeat the failed and destructive Obama administration. Mr. Trump's statement suggests that he believes the current administration has led to a decline in America's greatness and that his involvement in the election process may be necessary to restore it. He faced criticism from the Republican establishment for his ambiguous stance, and his decision to drop the debate may have been influenced by the low number of candidates willing to participate. However, Mr. Trump's continued focus on his potential candidacy underscores his belief in the importance of selecting a Republican candidate capable of bringing about positive change.

END OF SUMMARY.
