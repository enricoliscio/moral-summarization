Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Donald Trump dropping out of moderating a Republican debate. He's threatening to run as an independent if the chosen candidate isn't right. The Republicans are getting more than they bargained for by shunning him. Trump says he wants the right candidate to beat Obama but might run independently. He's criticized by the Republican establishment for moderating a debate while considering running. Instead of moderating, he stepped back to keep his options open, emphasizing making America great again. Only two candidates agreed to attend, which undermines Trump's kingmaker status.

I need to capture the essence: Trump's withdrawal, his potential independent run, criticism from Republicans, and the implications for the party. Keep it under 200 words, include the moral aspects like the criticism and the impact on the party.

Let me structure it: Trump drops debate, threatens to run, criticism, impact on his kingmaker status, and the potential consequences for Republicans.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these points concisely.
