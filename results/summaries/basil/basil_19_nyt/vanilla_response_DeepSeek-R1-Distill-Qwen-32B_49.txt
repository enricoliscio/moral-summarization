Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump dropping out of moderating a presidential debate. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand all the key points.

The article says that Trump has decided not to moderate the Newsmax debate. But he's not just stepping back quietly. Instead, his decision might cause more issues for the Republicans because they might have underestimated him. Trump made a statement saying he wants the right Republican candidate to defeat Obama but if he doesn't think the chosen candidate is right, he might run as an independent. That's a big deal because it shows he's still considering his options.

He faced criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating the debate while possibly running himself. Instead of going through with the debate and clarifying he wouldn't run, he dropped out. His main reason was keeping his options open to make America great again.

Also, only two candidates, Gingrich and Santorum, agreed to attend the debate, which undermined Trump's self-proclaimed role as a kingmaker in the Republican party. This probably made him look less influential than he thought.

So, the main points are: Trump drops out of moderating, threatens to run as an independent if he doesn't like the Republican candidate, faces criticism, only two candidates attend, and his influence is questioned.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these key points without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to first mention his withdrawal, then his potential independent run, the criticism, the limited attendance, and the impact on his influence.

Let me put it all together clearly and concisely.
