SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump has abandoned his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but has suggested he may run as an independent candidate if the Republican nominee is not to his liking. Mr. Trump's statement on Tuesday indicated that he believes the current Republican candidates may not be capable of defeating what he considers to be the "failed and destructive Obama administration." 

Mr. Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for his indecision, and the debate he was set to moderate was facing an awkward turnout with only two candidates agreeing to attend. Rather than declare that he will not run, as many had hoped, Mr. Trump has chosen to keep his options open, stating that "above all else, we must make America great again!" 

Mr. Trump's actions suggest that Republicans may have inadvertently given him a stronger platform by shunning him, and his continued presence in the political scene could prove to be a wildcard in the upcoming election. 

END OF SUMMARY.
