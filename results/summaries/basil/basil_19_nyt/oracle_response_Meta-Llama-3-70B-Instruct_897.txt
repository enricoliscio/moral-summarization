SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but this may not be the last we've seen of him in politics. In fact, Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the "right Republican candidate" is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration." However, if he's not pleased with the candidates, he's willing to run as an independent. Trump faced criticism for considering moderating a debate while keeping the door open to a presidential run. Instead of committing to the debate and ruling out a run, he chose to drop the debate, citing the need to keep his options open to "make America great again!" The debate was already in jeopardy, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to participate.

END OF SUMMARY.
