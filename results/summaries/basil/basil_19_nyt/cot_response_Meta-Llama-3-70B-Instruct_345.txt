SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In a statement, Trump emphasized the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat the "failed" and "destructive" Obama administration. However, he threatened to run as an independent candidate if he's not pleased with the chosen candidate, saying "I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!" Trump's decision comes after facing criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a presidential run while moderating a debate. The debate itself was facing a setback, with only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreeing to participate. Trump's move may have opened the door to another round of threats to run as an independent candidate. END OF SUMMARY.
