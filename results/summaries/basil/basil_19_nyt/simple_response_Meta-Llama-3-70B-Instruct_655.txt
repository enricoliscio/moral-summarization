SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but this may not be the end of his political ambitions. Despite facing criticism from the Republican establishment for considering a potential independent run while moderating a debate, Trump has chosen to drop the debate instead of committing to not running. He claims that he must "leave all of my options open" to ensure that "we must make America great again!" This decision comes after most Republican candidates declined to participate in the debate, damaging Trump's self-proclaimed status as a Republican kingmaker. Trump's statement suggests that he may still consider an independent run if he is not pleased with the chosen Republican candidate. This move is seen as a power play by Trump, who is unwilling to give up his right to run as an independent candidate. His actions are driven by a desire to put America first, even if it means going against the Republican establishment.
