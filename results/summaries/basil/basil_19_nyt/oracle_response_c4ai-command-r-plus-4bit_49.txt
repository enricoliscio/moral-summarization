SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump has backed out of moderating a Republican presidential debate, and in doing so, may have set the stage for another run at the presidency as an independent candidate. In a statement, Mr. Trump said that he was unwilling to give up his right to run as an independent if the Republican Party did not choose "the right candidate" to defeat what he called the "failed and destructive Obama administration." Mr. Trump's decision came after several Republican candidates declined to participate in the debate, dealing a blow to his self-proclaimed status as a Republican kingmaker. Rather than declare that he will not run and moderate the debate anyway, Mr. Trump chose to drop out of the debate, keeping his options open to ensure that "above all else, we must make America great again!"
END OF SUMMARY.
