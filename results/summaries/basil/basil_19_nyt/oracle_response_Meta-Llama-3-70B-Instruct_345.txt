SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In fact, Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him. Trump's statement emphasized the importance of choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration." However, he also threatened to run as an independent candidate if he's not pleased with the chosen candidate. Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating a debate while considering a presidential run. Instead of committing to the debate and ruling out a presidential bid, Trump chose to drop the debate, saying "I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!" Trump's move came after most candidates declined to participate in the debate, damaging his self-proclaimed status as Republican kingmaker.
