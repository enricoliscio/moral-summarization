SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In fact, Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him. Trump stated that he wants to ensure the "right Republican candidate" is chosen to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration." However, if he's not pleased with the candidate, he's willing to run as an independent. Trump faced criticism for moderating a debate while considering a presidential run, and instead chose to drop the debate. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreed to participate, while others declined, denting Trump's self-proclaimed status as Republican kingmaker. Trump emphasized that he must "make America great again!" and will keep his options open to achieve this goal.

END OF SUMMARY.
