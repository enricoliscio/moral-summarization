Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump dropping out of moderating a presidential debate. The user wants the summary to be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Trump is stepping down from moderating the Newsmax debate. He's not leaving politics quietly. Republicans might regret shunning him. Trump said he might run as an independent if the chosen Republican candidate isn't right. He criticized the establishment for letting him moderate while considering running. Instead of moderating, he's keeping his options open to run. The debate only had two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, which hurt Trump's image as a kingmaker. He issued a statement through his lawyer, Michael Cohen.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by stating Trump dropped plans to moderate. Then mention his potential run as an independent if the candidate isn't right. Highlight the criticism from Republicans and the fact he's keeping options open. Also, note the low turnout for the debate and its impact on his status. Finally, mention the statement through his lawyer.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to first state his withdrawal, then his possible run, the criticism, his keeping options open, the debate's low attendance, and the lawyer's statement. That should cover all necessary information succinctly.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has withdrawn from moderating a Newsmax presidential debate, signaling his continued influence in the Republican race. Trump hinted at potentially running as an independent if the chosen Republican candidate doesn’t align with his vision to “make America great again.” His decision to step back from moderating came amid criticism from the Republican establishment, as he had previously suggested he might still run for president. Trump emphasized his commitment to defeating the Obama administration but made it clear he would not abandon his independent candidacy option if dissatisfied with the party’s choice. The debate, which only two candidates agreed to attend, further weakened Trump’s image as a Republican kingmaker. His withdrawal leaves the political landscape uncertain, with Trump remaining a wildcard in the 2012 race. END OF SUMMARY.
