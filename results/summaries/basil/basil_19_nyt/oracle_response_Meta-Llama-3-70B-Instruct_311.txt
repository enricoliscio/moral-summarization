SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but this may not mark his exit from the political scene. In fact, Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him. Trump's statement emphasized the importance of choosing the right Republican candidate to defeat the "failed and very destructive Obama administration." However, he also threatened to run as an independent candidate if he's displeased with the chosen candidate, stating that he must "leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!" Trump's decision to drop the debate came after facing criticism for moderating while considering a presidential run. The debate was already in jeopardy, with only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreeing to participate. Trump's move may have salvaged his reputation as a Republican kingmaker, but it's clear he's not going quietly into the night.

END OF SUMMARY.
