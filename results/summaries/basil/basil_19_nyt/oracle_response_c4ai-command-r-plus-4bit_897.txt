SUMMARY: Donald J. Trump has abandoned his plans to moderate a presidential debate, but has suggested he may run as an independent candidate if the Republican Party does not choose "the right candidate" to defeat what he calls the "failed and destructive Obama administration." Mr. Trump's statement on Tuesday opened the door to further speculation about his political ambitions, as he refused to rule out an independent bid for the presidency. This comes after Mr. Trump faced criticism for his controversial decision to moderate a debate while considering his own run for office. Only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreed to participate, while others declined, damaging Mr. Trump's self-proclaimed status as a Republican kingmaker. Mr. Trump's statement emphasized the importance of making America "great" again, suggesting that he sees himself as a potential savior for the Republican Party and the nation. His decision to drop out of the debate moderation may be a strategic move to keep his options open and maintain his influence in the political arena.

END OF SUMMARY.
