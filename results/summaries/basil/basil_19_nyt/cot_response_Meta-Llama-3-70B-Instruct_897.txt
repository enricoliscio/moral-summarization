SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but he's not going away quietly. In a statement, Trump emphasized the importance of choosing the "right" Republican candidate to defeat the "failed" and "destructive" Obama administration. However, if he's not pleased with the candidates, he's willing to run as an independent, claiming it's essential to "make America great again!" Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating a debate while considering a presidential run. With only two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, agreeing to participate, Trump chose to drop the debate, leaving his options open. Trump's move may have given him more leverage, allowing him to continue flirting with a presidential bid. END OF SUMMARY.
