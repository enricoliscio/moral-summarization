SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has dropped out of moderating a presidential debate, but this may not be the last we've seen of him in politics. In fact, Republicans may have made a mistake by shunning him, as Trump has hinted that he may still run as an independent candidate if he's not pleased with the Republican nominee. Trump had faced criticism for considering moderating a debate while leaving the door open to a presidential run. Instead of committing to not running, Trump chose to drop out of the debate, citing the need to keep his options open to "make America great again." This decision comes after most Republican candidates declined to participate in the debate, undermining Trump's claim to be a Republican kingmaker. By keeping his options open, Trump is putting pressure on the Republican party to choose a candidate that meets his standards, or risk facing him as an independent opponent. END OF SUMMARY.
