SUMMARY:
Donald J. Trump has backed out of moderating a presidential debate, but this may not be the last Republicans hear of him. Mr. Trump's statement on Tuesday hinted at the possibility of him running as an independent candidate if the Republican candidate chosen is not, in his opinion, "the right candidate." This decision comes after Mr. Trump faced criticism from the Republican establishment for his controversial plan to moderate a debate while maintaining the option to run himself. The debate was already facing an awkward prospect, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreeing to participate, while other prominent Republicans declined, undermining Mr. Trump's aspirations of Republican kingmaker. Mr. Trump's statement, laden with threats and exclamation points, emphasizes his determination to "leave all options open" in the face of what he deems a destructive Obama administration. Mr. Trump's past flirtations with running for president have always ended in withdrawal, but his continued influence on the political scene and his displeasure with the current candidates may make this time different.
