Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Netanyahu's involvement in the U.S. election through an ad campaign. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Netanyahu is not directly endorsing a candidate but is featured in an ad by a conservative group. The ad aims to make Iran a major issue, especially in Florida, a swing state. The message is about the urgency of stopping Iran's nuclear program and the need for American strength.

I should note that the ad doesn't mention Obama or Romney but uses Netanyahu's frustration with the Obama administration. The ad's message is that the world needs American strength, not apologies. The group behind it is Secure America Now, spending $1 million in Jewish markets in Florida.

Additionally, there's another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's policies. Polls show that many Jewish voters are reconsidering their support for Obama.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspect of the urgency and the role of American leadership in preventing Iran's nuclear threat. I'll structure it to first mention Netanyahu's ad, its message, the group behind it, and then touch on the other campaign and the polls.

I should avoid including too much detail about the ad's specifics or the other campaign, keeping it brief but comprehensive. Also, ensure that the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the need for action and the impact on the election.
