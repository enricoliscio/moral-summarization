SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become involved in the American presidential election through a new ad campaign in the battleground state of Florida, criticizing President Obama's failure to set clear "red lines" for Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb each day and urges for stronger action to prevent this from happening. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to influence Jewish voters in Florida, a key swing state with 29 electoral votes. Separately, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in other swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu's message emphasizes the need for American strength and determination to act, rather than apologies, when it comes to the Iran threat. Netanyahu's involvement in the election underscores the importance of Israel and Iran as key issues for voters and could have a significant impact on the outcome in Florida and beyond. END OF SUMMARY.
