Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Netanyahu's involvement in the American election through an ad in Florida, a battleground state. He's criticizing Obama's approach to Iran's nuclear program, using terms like "failure" and "get." The ad is funded by a conservative group and targets Jewish voters. There's also mention of another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition. 

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral words: failure, gets, apologies, share, prevent, getting, get. I'll structure the summary to highlight Netanyahu's criticism, the ad's message, and the potential impact on the election. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. 

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral terms are included. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll make sure to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite stating he would avoid involvement in the U.S. presidential election, is featured in a new ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, highlights Netanyahu's frustration with the Obama administration's "failure" to establish "red lines" to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. He warns, "Every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb," urging action rather than waiting. The ad's voice-over emphasizes the need for "American strength, not apologies." The message resonates with Jewish voters, as polls show strong support for Israel and concern that Iran may share nuclear weapons with terrorists. The ad, set to air in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Fort Myers, could influence the election, with Florida's 29 electoral votes potentially swinging the outcome. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition is running its own $5 million ad campaign in swing states, targeting Jewish voters disillusioned with Obama's policies. Netanyahu also appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," urging Obama to take a tougher stance to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
