SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become involved in the American presidential election with a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, paid for by the conservative group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and criticizes the Obama administration for its failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear program. Netanyahu warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb and urges the world to act before it's too late. The ad underscores Netanyahu's message that the world needs American strength, not apologies. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic and Israel policies. These ads give voice to the doubts many Jewish voters feel about Obama, as his support among this demographic has eroded. Netanyahu also appeared on "Meet the Press," urging Obama to take a tougher line with Iran to prevent them from getting nuclear weapons.
END OF SUMMARY.
