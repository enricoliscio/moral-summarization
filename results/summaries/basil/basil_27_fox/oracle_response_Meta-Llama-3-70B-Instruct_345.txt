SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in a new ad in Florida, criticizing the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu warns that Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb every day, and the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the presidential election. Netanyahu's message is particularly influential in heavily-Jewish markets, where sizable majorities believe Iran will share nuclear weapons with terrorists. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting the "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who voted for Obama four years ago but are now disillusioned with his economic policies and his policies toward Israel. Netanyahu urges Obama to take a tougher line with Iran, emphasizing that he must act before they get nuclear weapons.
