SUMMARY: Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, has taken a stand against the Obama administration's failure to set clear boundaries for Iran and its developing nuclear weapons program. In a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, Netanyahu emphasizes the urgency of the situation, stating that Iran is getting closer to obtaining a nuclear bomb while the world tells Israel to wait. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group, aims to make Iran a significant campaign issue in the upcoming presidential election. Netanyahu's message, reinforced by a voice-over stating that "the world needs American strength, not apologies," could influence Jewish voters in Florida, a state with 29 electoral votes that is currently considered a toss-up. The ad also highlights Netanyahu's famously frosty relationship with President Obama and calls for stronger leadership on the world stage. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, emphasizing Obama's allegedly disappointing policies toward Israel and his lackluster economic policies. Netanyahu's recent appearances and statements underscore his commitment to urging the Obama administration to take a tougher stance against Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
