SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become involved in the American presidential election through a new ad campaign set to air in the battleground state of Florida, despite his claims that he would remain neutral. The ad, paid for by the conservative group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu's recent comments criticizing the Obama administration's handling of Iran and its nuclear program. Netanyahu's message, reinforced by a voice-over, emphasizes the need for American strength and action against Iran. With Florida's 29 electoral votes at stake and the state considered a toss-up, the ad could have a significant impact on Jewish voters in the state. Additionally, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, expressing their disillusionment with Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu's recent appearance on "Meet the Press" further underscored his stance on Iran, urging Obama to take a tougher and more proactive approach. These actions highlight the moral imperative of ensuring American strength and security, and taking a firm stance against the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.
END OF SUMMARY.
