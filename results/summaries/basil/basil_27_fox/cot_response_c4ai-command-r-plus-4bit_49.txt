SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stars in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state in the upcoming American presidential election. Netanyahu, who has a notoriously frosty relationship with President Obama, does not mention either candidate by name but instead focuses on their stance towards Iran and its rogue nuclear program. He expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to set red lines to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. The ad, paid for by the conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and could have a powerful influence on heavily Jewish markets in the state. Florida, with its 29 electoral votes, is considered a toss-up, and the ad seeks to highlight the need for American strength and a tougher stance on global issues. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, playing on the theme of "buyer's remorse" among those who voted for Obama in the last election but are now disillusioned with his economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu has also urged Obama to take a tougher line with Iran, emphasizing that determined action means acting before Iran acquires nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
