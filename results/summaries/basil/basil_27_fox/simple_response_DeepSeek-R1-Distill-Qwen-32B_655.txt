Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about Netanyahu's involvement in the US election through an ad in Florida. He's criticizing Obama's approach to Iran's nuclear program. The ad is funded by a conservative group, Secure America Now, and it's targeting Jewish voters. There's also mention of another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all the important elements.

I should highlight Netanyahu's role, the content of the ad, the funding, and the impact on the election. Also, the moral framing is about the importance of American strength against Iran, so I need to make sure that's clear. I'll structure the summary to include Netanyahu's criticism, the ad's message, the funding details, and the potential influence on Jewish voters in Florida. I should also mention the other campaign by the Republican group to show the broader context.

Let me make sure I'm not missing any crucial points. The article mentions that Florida is a battleground state, and the ad could sway the election. The quotes from Jeri Thompson and Matt Brooks are important to include as they show the support and the strategy behind these ads. I should also note that Netanyahu isn't endorsing either candidate directly but is influencing the debate on Iran.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll condense this into a clear, concise summary that flows well and maintains the moral stance presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indirectly influenced the U.S. presidential election by appearing in a campaign ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu criticizing President Obama's failure to establish "red lines" against Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu's message emphasizes the urgency of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, urging American strength rather than apologies. The ad aims to sway Jewish voters, a significant demographic in Florida, where the race is tight. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a $5 million ad campaign in swing states, highlighting Jewish disillusionment with Obama's policies on Israel and the economy. Netanyahu's appearances in U.S. media underscore his role as a powerful messenger on Iran, adding moral weight to the debate over American leadership and Israel's security. END OF SUMMARY.
