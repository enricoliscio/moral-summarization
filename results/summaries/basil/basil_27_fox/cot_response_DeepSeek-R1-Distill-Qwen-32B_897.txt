Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's involvement in the American election through an ad campaign targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad focuses on Iran's nuclear program and criticizes the Obama administration for not setting "red lines" to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. 

The user has already provided a summary, but I need to make sure that I capture all the morally framed words. In the article, words like "frosty," "failure," "frustration," "rogue," "closer," "closer," "until when," "strength," "apologies," "sizable majorities," "believe," "share," "terrorists," "strong," "powerful," "messenger," "message," "believe," "buyer's remorse," "disillusioned," "erosion," "support," "doubts," "prevent," "act," and "before" are highlighted. These words carry moral connotations, indicating approval or disapproval.

In the summary, I should include as many of these words as possible without making it sound forced. The summary should mention Netanyahu's ad, the focus on Iran's nuclear program, the criticism of the Obama administration, the potential influence on Jewish voters, and the broader implications for the election. I also need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

I should start by stating that Netanyahu is avoiding direct involvement but using an ad. Then mention the focus on Iran and the criticism of Obama's approach. Include the message from the ad and the group behind it. Highlight the target areas and the potential impact on the election. Also, note the Republican Jewish Coalition's separate campaign and the shift in Jewish support. Finally, mention Netanyahu's call for tougher action on Iran.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes the morally framed words naturally. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each part is clear and concise.
