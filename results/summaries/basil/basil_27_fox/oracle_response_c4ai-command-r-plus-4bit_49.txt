SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizes President Obama's failure to prevent Iran from getting closer to possessing nuclear weapons. Netanyahu stars in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, where his words from a recent news conference are featured. He expresses frustration at the Obama administration's lack of action on setting "red lines" for Iran's nuclear program. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and could influence Jewish voters in Florida, a toss-up state with 29 electoral votes. Netanyahu also appeared on "Meet the Press," urging Obama to act before Iran obtains nuclear weapons. The Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's policies toward Israel. The world, Netanyahu implies, should demand American strength, not apologies, when it comes to the Iran threat.
END OF SUMMARY.
