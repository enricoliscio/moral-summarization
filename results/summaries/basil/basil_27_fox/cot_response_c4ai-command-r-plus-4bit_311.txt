SUMMARY: In the run-up to the American presidential election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has starred in an ad campaign aimed at Jewish voters in swing states like Florida, a crucial battleground state. Netanyahu's message focuses on the threat of Iran's rogue nuclear program and the "frustration" he feels towards the Obama administration's inaction. Netanyahu urges the world not to "wait" any longer and calls for American "strength" instead of apologies. The ad campaign emphasizes the "support" for Israel among Jewish voters and portrays Netanyahu as a "powerful" messenger. Netanyahu also made a recent "appearance" on "Meet the Press," where he called for a tougher stance against Iran, challenging President Obama to "act" on his determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The ad campaign reflects the moral framing of responsibility, urgency, and strength in addressing global threats. Netanyahu's involvement adds a layer of moral authority to the election discourse.
