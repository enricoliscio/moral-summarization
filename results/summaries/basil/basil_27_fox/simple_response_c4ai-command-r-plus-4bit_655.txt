SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become involved in the American presidential election with a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, paid for by conservative group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu's recent comments criticizing the Obama administration for its failure to set "red lines" for Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu has a notoriously cold relationship with President Obama and his involvement in the election could be influential in heavily-Jewish markets like Miami. The ad aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and portrays Netanyahu as a powerful messenger with a powerful message. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" for voting for Obama in the last election. Netanyahu is urging Obama to take a tougher stance on Iran, arguing that if he is truly determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, he must act before it is too late. END OF SUMMARY.
