SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in a new ad in Florida, urging the US to take a tougher stance on Iran's nuclear program. The ad, paid for by conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu's words from a recent news conference, where he expressed frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran. Netanyahu warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb every day, and that the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the US presidential election, and could have a significant influence in heavily-Jewish markets. This comes as Jewish support for Obama is eroding, with many feeling disillusioned with his economic policies and stance on Israel.

END OF SUMMARY.
