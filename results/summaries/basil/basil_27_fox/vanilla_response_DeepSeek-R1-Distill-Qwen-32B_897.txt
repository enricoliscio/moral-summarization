Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his involvement in the American presidential election. He's not directly campaigning but is featured in an ad in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad's goal is to make Iran a major issue in the campaign. 

Netanyahu has a frosty relationship with Obama but worked with Romney in the 70s. The ad uses his recent statements about Iran's nuclear program, expressing frustration with Obama's approach. The message is that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb, and the world is telling Israel to wait, but Netanyahu is questioning what they're waiting for. The ad ends with a call for American strength, not apologies, paid for by a conservative group called Secure America Now. 

The ad is targeting Jewish markets in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes, so it's crucial. Polls show Obama leading there. Another group, the Republican Jewish Coalition, is also running ads in swing states, focusing on Jewish voters' disillusionment with Obama's policies. Netanyahu also appeared on TV urging a tougher stance on Iran. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Netanyahu's ad, its purpose, the group behind it, the target audience, and the political implications. Also, mention the other ad campaign by the Republican group. Keep it concise and include key points: Netanyahu's involvement, the message about Iran, the groups involved, the states targeted, and the impact on the election.

The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu expressing frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" against Iran's nuclear program. His message emphasizes the urgency of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with a voiceover calling for "American strength, not apologies."
