Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his involvement in the American presidential election through an ad campaign. 

First, I need to identify the main points. Netanyahu is avoiding direct involvement but is featured in an ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad's purpose is to make Iran a major issue. He's critical of Obama's approach to Iran's nuclear program, saying the administration hasn't set clear "red lines." The ad is produced by a conservative group, Secure America Now, and it's airing in Florida, which has a significant Jewish population.

I should note that the ad's message emphasizes the need for American strength and not apologies. The cost is $1 million, and it's airing in Miami and other areas. Florida is a swing state with 29 electoral votes, so this could influence the election. There's also mention of another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's policies.

Netanyahu's appearance on NBC's Meet the Press is another point, where he urged a tougher stance on Iran. Polls show Obama leading in Florida, but there's a shift in Jewish support towards Romney.

Now, I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Netanyahu's indirect involvement through the ad, the focus on Iran, the group behind it, and the target demographics. Then mention the ad's message and cost, the significance of Florida, the other campaign by the coalition, Netanyahu's TV appearance, and the polling situation.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all key elements without being too detailed. Also, keeping it under 200 words is crucial. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is included succinctly.
