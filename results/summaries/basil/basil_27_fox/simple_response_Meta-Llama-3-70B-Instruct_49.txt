SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in a new ad in Florida, a key battleground state, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue in the American presidential election. Without mentioning President Obama or Mitt Romney, Netanyahu expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. He warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb every day, and the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, could have a significant influence in heavily-Jewish markets. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's economic policies and his stance on Israel. Netanyahu's message emphasizes the need for a stronger stance against Iran, urging Obama to take action before it's too late.
