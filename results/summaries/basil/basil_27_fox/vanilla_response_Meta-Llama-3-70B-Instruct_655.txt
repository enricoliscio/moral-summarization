SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, which aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by nonprofit conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu expressing frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu's message emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies, in dealing with Iran. The ad could have a significant influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami, and may sway the election in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who voted for Obama four years ago.
