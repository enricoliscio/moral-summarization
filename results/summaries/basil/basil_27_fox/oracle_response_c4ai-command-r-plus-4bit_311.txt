SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stars in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by a conservative advocacy group, aims to make Iran's rogue nuclear program a major campaign issue. Netanyahu has a famously frosty relationship with President Obama, and in the ad, he expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran. Netanyahu warns that Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb each day and questions how long the world can wait to take action. A voice-over at the end of the ad emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies. The ad could have a powerful influence in heavily Jewish markets and could sway the election, as Florida is considered a toss-up state. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate ad campaign aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu also urges Obama to take a tougher line with Iran to prevent them from getting nuclear weapons.
END OF SUMMARY.
