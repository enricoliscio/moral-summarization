Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu not directly interfering in the American election but being featured in an ad aimed at Florida, a battleground state. The ad focuses on Iran's nuclear program and criticizes Obama's approach. It mentions that the ad is paid for by a conservative group, Secure America Now, and is targeting Jewish markets, especially in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes. The ad's message is about the need for American strength against Iran, and it's costing $1 million. There's also another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition spending $5 million, targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's policies.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The article presents Netanyahu as a strong voice against Iran, emphasizing the urgency of the nuclear threat. It also contrasts Obama's approach with Romney's, implying Romney would be tougher. The ads are trying to sway Jewish voters, who traditionally support Democrats but might be moving towards Republicans due to concerns about Obama's policies towards Israel and the economy.

I should structure the summary to include Netanyahu's ad, its purpose, the group behind it, the target audience, and the potential impact on the election. Also, mention the other campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition and their reasons for the shift in Jewish support.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure to highlight the moral aspect of the urgency against Iran and the political strategy of targeting Jewish voters.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while avoiding direct involvement in the U.S. presidential election, is featured in a new ad aimed at Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by conservative group Secure America Now, highlights Netanyahu's concerns about Iran's nuclear program and criticizes the Obama administration's lack of "red lines" to curb it. Netanyahu's message underscores the urgency of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, emphasizing the need for American strength. The ad targets Jewish communities, particularly in Miami, where Jewish support for Obama is eroding. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a $5 million ad campaign in swing states, focusing on Jewish disillusionment with Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu's appeal for a tougher stance on Iran aligns with Romney's stance, potentially influencing Jewish voters. The ad's timing and messaging aim to sway the election in Romney's favor. END OF SUMMARY.
