SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has inserted himself into the American presidential election, starring in a new ad that aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the key battleground state of Florida. Netanyahu's words, taken from a recent news conference, express frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. "The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb," he says, implying that the world is failing to prevent this catastrophic outcome. The ad's message is clear: "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The ad, paid for by nonprofit conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting the "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who are disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel.

END OF SUMMARY.
