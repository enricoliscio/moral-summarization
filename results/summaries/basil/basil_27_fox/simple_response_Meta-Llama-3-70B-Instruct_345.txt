SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad in Florida, a key battleground state, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue in the American presidential election. Netanyahu's message is clear: the world needs American strength, not apologies, and Iran's nuclear program is a pressing issue that requires immediate action. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, highlights Netanyahu's frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran. Netanyahu's words are a powerful reminder that every day that passes, Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb. The ad's message resonates with Jewish voters, who are increasingly disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his stance on Israel. As the election approaches, Netanyahu's voice adds weight to the debate, urging the US to take a tougher line with Iran.
