SUMMARY:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad in Florida, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue in the American presidential election. In the ad, Netanyahu expresses his frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. He warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb every day, and the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting the "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community, who are disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel. Netanyahu urges Obama to take a tougher line with Iran, emphasizing that he must act before they get nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
