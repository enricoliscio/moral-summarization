Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Netanyahu and the political ads in Florida. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not directly involved in the American election but is featured in a new ad in Florida. This ad is aimed at making Iran a major campaign issue. I should note that Florida is a battleground state, so it's important for the election.

The ad uses Netanyahu's statements from a recent news conference where he criticized the Obama administration for not setting "red lines" to stop Iran's nuclear program. He's frustrated that the world tells Israel to wait, but he's asking what they're waiting for. The ad's message is that the world needs American strength, not apologies. This is paid for by a conservative group called Secure America Now, which is spending $1 million on the ad in Miami and other areas.

Florida is a swing state with 29 electoral votes, so the ad could influence the election. The article also mentions that a Fox News poll shows Obama leading Romney in Florida, 49% to 44%. Additionally, another group, the Republican Jewish Coalition, is running a $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's policies.

Netanyahu also appeared on NBC's Meet the Press, urging Obama to take a tougher stance on Iran. He emphasized that preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons means acting before they do.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Netanyahu's ad in Florida, the focus on Iran, the funding by Secure America Now, and the potential influence in Florida. Then, I'll note the Fox poll and the other ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition. Finally, I'll include Netanyahu's recent comments on Meet the Press.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covering all key points without going into too much detail. Also, I need to keep it concise, so I'll avoid unnecessary details and stick to the main facts.
