SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. He warns that "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb," and asks "wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, underscores the prime minister's message: "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The ad could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, as sizable majorities believe Iran will share nuclear weapons with terrorists. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting the "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who are disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel.

END OF SUMMARY.
