Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his involvement in the American presidential election through an ad campaign. He's not directly supporting either Obama or Romney but is using an ad to make Iran a key issue. The ad is paid for by a conservative group called Secure America Now, and it's airing in Florida, a crucial battleground state.

The morally framed words the user wants preserved are: failure, gets, apologies, share, prevent, getting, get. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Netanyahu's ad, the group behind it, the message about Iran, the target states, and the implications for the election. I should mention the moral framing words where appropriate.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I'll structure it to include Netanyahu's frustration with the Obama administration's failure to set red lines, the ad's message about waiting for Iran, the group's spending, and the impact on Jewish voters.

Also, I should note the other ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's policies.

I'll make sure to use the words like "failure," "get," "prevent," and "share" where they fit naturally in the summary.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all the moral framing words are appropriately included without forcing them in.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, known for his frosty relationship with President Obama, has avoided endorsing either candidate in the U.S. presidential election. However, he features in a new ad by conservative group Secure America Now, aimed at making Iran a key issue in Florida, a battleground state. The ad uses Netanyahu’s recent comments expressing frustration with the Obama administration’s failure to establish “red lines” to prevent Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu warns, “Every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb,” urging action. The ad’s message, “The world needs American strength, not apologies,” targets Jewish voters in Florida, where the election could swing. Secure America Now is spending $1 million on the ad campaign in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Fort Myers. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition is running a $5 million ad blitz in swing states, highlighting Jewish disillusionment with Obama’s policies. Netanyahu also urged Obama to take a tougher stance on Iran during his appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” END OF SUMMARY.
