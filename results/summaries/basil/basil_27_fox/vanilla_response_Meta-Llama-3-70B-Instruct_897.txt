SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, which aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by nonprofit conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu expressing frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. The ad's message is that the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami, and could potentially swing the election in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states.

END OF SUMMARY.
