Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should include the words: failure, gets, apologies, share, prevent, getting, get. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Netanyahu is involved in a Florida ad targeting the election, focusing on Iran's nuclear program. He's criticizing Obama's approach as a failure. The ad is by Secure America Now and aims to influence Jewish voters. It emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies, and the potential consequences of Iran sharing nuclear weapons. There's also mention of another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words. I'll start by mentioning Netanyahu's ad and the criticism of Obama's failure. Then, highlight the message about Iran getting closer to a nuclear bomb and the need to prevent that. I should also include the part about sharing nuclear weapons with terrorists and the importance of American strength without apologies. Finally, mention the other campaign showing Jewish disillusionment with Obama.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each moral word is included naturally. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ending with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is featured in a new ad in Florida, a key battleground state, aimed at making Iran a major campaign issue. The ad, paid for by the conservative group Secure America Now, uses Netanyahu's recent statements criticizing the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Netanyahu warns, "Every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb," urging action before it's too late. The ad's message emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies, and highlights concerns that Iran may share nuclear weapons with terrorists. Secure America Now's $1 million ad campaign targets heavily Jewish markets in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Fort Myers. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a $5 million ad blitz in swing states, targeting Jewish voters disillusioned with Obama's policies on Israel and the economy. Netanyahu's appearances and messages are designed to underscore the urgency of preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons and the failure of current policies. END OF SUMMARY.
