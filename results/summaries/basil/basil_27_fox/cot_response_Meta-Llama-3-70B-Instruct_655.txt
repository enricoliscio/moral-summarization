SUMMARY:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in a new ad in Florida, urging the US to take a stronger stance against Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran, saying "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb." He emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the presidential election. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic policies and stance on Israel. Netanyahu's message is clear: the world needs American strength to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
