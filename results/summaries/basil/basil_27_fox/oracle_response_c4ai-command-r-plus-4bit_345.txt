SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become involved in the American presidential election, starring in an ad campaign in the battleground state of Florida. The ad, paid for by the conservative group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and criticize the Obama administration for its failure to establish clear red lines on Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu's message warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb and that the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad could have a powerful influence on Jewish voters in Florida, a key swing state with 29 electoral votes. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in other swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu has urged Obama to take a tougher line on Iran, stating that determined action is needed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
