SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has starred in a new ad in Florida, a key battleground state, making Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu's words, taken from a recent news conference, express frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. He emphasizes the urgency of the situation, warning that Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb every day. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to sway Jewish voters in Florida, where support for Israel remains strong. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic policies and stance on Israel. Netanyahu's message is clear: the world needs American strength, not apologies, and the US must take a tougher line with Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
