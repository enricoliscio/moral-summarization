SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu expressing frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb and urges the US to take a tougher line. The ad's message is underscored by a voice-over saying "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The ad is part of a $1 million campaign targeting Jewish voters in Florida, where Obama is currently leading Romney in the polls. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states.
