Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his involvement in the American presidential election, specifically through an ad campaign in Florida. He's not directly supporting either Obama or Romney, but his ad is aimed at making Iran a key issue. The ad uses his statements from a recent news conference where he criticized Obama's approach to Iran's nuclear program. The message is about the urgency of stopping Iran's nuclear progress.

The ad is being run by a conservative group called Secure America Now, and it's targeting Jewish markets in Florida, which is a crucial swing state. The ad emphasizes the need for American strength against Iran. There's also mention of another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their disillusionment with Obama's policies.

The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should include Netanyahu's ad, its purpose, the group behind it, the target demographics, the political significance, and the other campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition. I need to make sure it's clear and to the point without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is avoiding direct involvement in the U.S. presidential election but is featured in a new ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by conservative group Secure America Now, uses Netanyahu's recent comments criticizing the Obama administration's approach to Iran's nuclear program. He emphasizes the urgency of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, urging action before it's too late. The ad's message, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," aims to sway Jewish voters in Florida, where Netanyahu's influence is significant. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a $5 million ad campaign in swing states, targeting Jewish voters disillusioned with Obama's policies. The ad highlights "buyer's remorse" among Jewish voters who supported Obama in 2008 but are now critical of his economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu also appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," urging a tougher stance on Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
