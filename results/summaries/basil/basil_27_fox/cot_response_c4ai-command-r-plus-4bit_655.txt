SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will steer clear of the American presidential election, but he stars in a new ad that aims to make Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu, who has a famously frosty relationship with President Obama, expresses frustration at the Obama administrationâ€™s failure to set red lines for Iran's rogue nuclear program. Netanyahu's message, "Wait for what? Wait until when?" underscores his belief that the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad, featuring Netanyahu's powerful message, could have a significant influence in heavily Jewish markets in the swing state of Florida, where support for Israel remains strong. The Republican Jewish Coalition has also launched a separate ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" with Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu urges Obama to take a tougher, more determined stance against Iran, emphasizing the need to act before they acquire nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
