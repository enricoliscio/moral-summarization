SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stars in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state in the upcoming US presidential election. The ad, paid for by a conservative advocacy group, aims to make Iran's nuclear program a major campaign issue. Netanyahu, who has a frosty relationship with President Obama, expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for Iran. The ad underscores Netanyahu's message that "the world needs American strength, not apologies." The ad could influence heavily Jewish markets in Florida, a toss-up state with 29 electoral votes. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" with Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu also urged Obama to take tougher action against Iran on NBC's "Meet the Press." END OF SUMMARY.
