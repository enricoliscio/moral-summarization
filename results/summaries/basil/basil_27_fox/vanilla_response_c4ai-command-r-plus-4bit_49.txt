SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stars in a new political ad that will air in Florida, a key battleground state in the upcoming American presidential election. The ad, paid for by conservative group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu's recent remarks expressing concern about Iran's nuclear program and criticizing the Obama administration's failure to set "red lines" for Iran. Netanyahu does not endorse either Obama or Romney in the ad, but his presence could influence Jewish voters in Florida, a crucial swing state. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in other swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's policies. Netanyahu has urged Obama to take a tougher stance on Iran, warning that Iran is getting closer to developing nuclear weapons.
END OF SUMMARY.
