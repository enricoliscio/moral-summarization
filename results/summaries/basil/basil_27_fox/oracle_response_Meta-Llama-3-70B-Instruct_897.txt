SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made a bold move in the American presidential election, starring in a new ad that aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the key battleground state of Florida. Netanyahu's words, taken from a recent news conference, express his frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. He warns that "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb," and asks, "wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad's message is clear: "The world needs American strength, not apologies." Netanyahu's powerful message is likely to resonate with Jewish voters in Florida, who believe that Iran will share nuclear weapons with terrorists. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, could have a significant influence in the election. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel.

END OF SUMMARY.
