Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified certain morally framed words that should be included. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's involvement in the American presidential election through an ad campaign. The ad is aimed at making Iran a key issue, especially in Florida, a battleground state. Netanyahu's frustration with Obama's approach to Iran is highlighted, and the ad is funded by a conservative group. The ad's message is about American strength and not making apologies, targeting Jewish voters. There's also mention of another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition targeting Jewish voters with similar themes.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: failure, gets, apologies, share, prevent, getting, get. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Netanyahu's ad, the target states, the funding group, the message about Iran and American strength, the mention of failure in establishing red lines, the ad's cost, and the other campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition.

I should structure the summary to include all these points concisely, using the specified moral words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.

First, mention Netanyahu's ad in Florida, the group behind it, and the main message about Iran. Then, include his criticism of Obama's failure to set red lines, the frustration about getting closer to a nuclear bomb. Next, highlight the ad's message about American strength and not apologies. Mention the cost and the target areas. Then, add the other campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition and their message about Obama's policies and the shift in Jewish support.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points are included with the moral framing words. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite stating he would avoid involvement in the U.S. presidential election, stars in a new ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu criticizes the Obama administration for its failure to establish "red lines" to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons, stating, "Every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb." The ad's message emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies, and could influence Jewish voters in Florida, where the election is considered a toss-up. The ad, set to air in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Fort Myers, costs $1 million. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a $5 million ad campaign in swing states, highlighting Jewish disillusionment with Obama's policies toward Israel. Netanyahu also urged Obama to take a tougher stance on Iran in a recent interview, emphasizing the need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons before it's too late. END OF SUMMARY.
