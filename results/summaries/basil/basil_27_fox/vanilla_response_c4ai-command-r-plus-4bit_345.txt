SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stars in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by conservative group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and criticizes the Obama administration for not taking a tougher stance on Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu's words are taken from a recent news conference where he expressed frustration at the lack of "red lines" for Iran. The ad cost $1 million and will air in heavily Jewish markets in Florida, including Miami, West Palm Beach, and Fort Myers. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million ad campaign aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu also appeared on "Meet the Press," urging Obama to take stronger action against Iran. The ad and Netanyahu's recent media appearances underscore the importance of the Jewish vote and the Middle East policy in the upcoming election.
