Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified certain words that carry moral weight. I should make sure those words are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Netanyahu is involved in an ad campaign in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad is about Iran's nuclear program and is funded by a conservative group. It's targeting Jewish voters, which could influence the election. The ad emphasizes the failure of the Obama administration to set red lines on Iran, and Netanyahu's frustration is highlighted. 

I notice the morally framed words: failure, gets, apologies, share, prevent, getting, get. I need to incorporate these into the summary without making it too long. 

I should structure the summary to include Netanyahu's role in the ad, the message about Iran, the funding group, the target audience, and the potential impact on the election. I'll make sure to use the specified words where appropriate. 

Also, I need to keep it under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise. 

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral words are included. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

I think I've covered all the essential elements. Now, I'll present the summary as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is featured in a new ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state, to make Iran a major campaign issue. The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, uses Netanyahu's recent statements expressing frustration over the Obama administration's "failure" to establish "red lines" against Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu warns that Iran is "getting" closer to a nuclear bomb and criticizes the world for urging Israel to "wait," questioning, "Wait until when?" The ad's voice-over emphasizes, "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The $1 million ad aims to influence heavily Jewish markets in Florida, where support for Israel remains strong. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition is running a $5 million ad campaign in swing states, highlighting Jewish disillusionment with Obama's policies. Netanyahu also urged Obama to "prevent" Iran from "getting" nuclear weapons during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." The ad's message aligns with polls showing Jewish voters' concerns about Iran "sharing" nuclear weapons with terrorists and their growing doubts about Obama's policies. END OF SUMMARY.
