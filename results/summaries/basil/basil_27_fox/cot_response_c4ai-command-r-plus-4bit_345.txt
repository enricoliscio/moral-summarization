SUMMARY: In a new ad set to air in Florida, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns about the dangers of Iran's nuclear program and criticizes the Obama administration for its failure to establish "red lines." Netanyahu's words carry moral weight, expressing frustration and urging action against a rogue nuclear threat. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to influence Jewish voters in Florida, a key battleground state, by emphasizing the need for American strength and leadership on the world stage. It portrays Netanyahu as a powerful messenger with a strong message about the dangers of waiting too long to act. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition launches a separate $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their "buyer's remorse" with Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu urges Obama to take a tougher, more determined stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions, warning of the consequences of inaction. END OF SUMMARY.
