Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the structure they want. They specified two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing the summary.

Looking at the article, it's about Netanyahu's ad in Florida targeting the election. The user wants me to extract single words that carry moral implications. I'll go through the text and pick out words like "frosty," "failure," "frustration," "closer," "nuclear bomb," "strength," "apologies," "influence," "swing," "erosion," "disillusioned," and "doubts." These words convey judgment or evaluation, which is the moral framing.

Next, the summary needs to incorporate these words without exceeding 200 words. I should focus on the key points: Netanyahu's ad, the groups involved, the message about Iran, and the impact on Jewish voters. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the author's tone. I'll structure the summary to highlight Netanyahu's role, the ad's message, and the potential influence on the election, ensuring it's concise and captures the essence of the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has avoided direct involvement in the U.S. presidential election but is featured in a new ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu expresses frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" to rein in Iran's nuclear program, warning that Iran is getting "closer and closer to a nuclear bomb." The ad's message emphasizes the need for "American strength, not apologies." Secure America Now believes Netanyahu’s message will resonate strongly with Jewish voters, as polls show significant support for Israel and concern over Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition is also running ads targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting "buyer's remorse" among those who supported Obama in 2008 but are now disillusioned with his policies. Netanyahu’s appearances and statements continue to underscore his call for a tougher stance on Iran, while the ad’s influence could swing the election in Florida. END OF SUMMARY.
