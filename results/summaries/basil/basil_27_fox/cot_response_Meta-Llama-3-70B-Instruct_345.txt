SUMMARY:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad in Florida, urging the US to take a stronger stance against Iran's nuclear program. In the ad, Netanyahu expresses frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. He warns that every day that passes, Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb, and asks, "Wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue and emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies. The ad could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami, where support for Israel remains strong. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting the "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who are disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel.
