SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, features Netanyahu's words from a recent news conference, where he expressed frustration with the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. The ad's message emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies, and could have a significant influence in heavily-Jewish markets. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting "buyer's remorse" among Jewish voters who supported Obama in 2008 but are now disillusioned with his economic and Israel policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
