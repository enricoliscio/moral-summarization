Alright, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. They also mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. 

First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Netanyahu's involvement in the U.S. election through an ad campaign focused on Iran. The article mentions that Netanyahu is not directly supporting Romney but is using the ad to make Iran a key issue. The ad is funded by a conservative group, Secure America Now, targeting Jewish voters in Florida, a swing state.

I should focus on the moral aspects here. The ad emphasizes the need for American strength against Iran's nuclear threat, positioning Netanyahu as a credible messenger. It's also highlighting the shift in Jewish support from Obama to Romney, which is a moral stance on policy and leadership.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points: Netanyahu's ad, the funding group, the target demographic, the message about Iran, and the potential impact on the election. Also, the moral framing is about the urgency of stopping Iran and the trust in Romney's approach.

I'll structure the summary to start with Netanyahu's action, mention the ad's message, the funding, the target states, the polling, and the shift in Jewish support. I should keep it clear and direct, ensuring all moral elements are highlighted without adding personal opinions.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is indirectly influencing the U.S. presidential election through a new ad campaign in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by the conservative group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu expressing concern over Iran's nuclear program and urging the U.S. to take a stronger stance. Netanyahu's message emphasizes the urgency of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, stating, "The world tells Israel, wait, there's still time. And I say wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad's voiceover reinforces the need for "American strength, not apologies." Targeting heavily Jewish markets, the campaign aims to sway voters in Florida, where Netanyahu's message resonates strongly. Polls show many Jewish voters are disillusioned with Obama's policies on Israel and the economy, leading to a potential shift in support toward Romney. The Republican Jewish Coalition is also running ads in swing states to capitalize on this sentiment. Netanyahu's involvement highlights the moral framing of the issue, emphasizing the urgency of confronting Iran and the importance of strong leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
