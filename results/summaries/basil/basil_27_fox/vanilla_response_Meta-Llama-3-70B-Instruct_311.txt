SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state in the US presidential election. The ad, paid for by the conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu expresses frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program, warning that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb every day. The ad's message is underscored by a voice-over stating "The world needs American strength, not apologies." The ad is expected to have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who voted for Obama four years ago.
