SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to take sides in the American presidential election, but a new ad featuring him is set to air in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, paid for by conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, uses Netanyahu's words from a recent news conference to express frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu warns that Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb every day, and the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad aims to make Iran a major campaign issue, highlighting the Obama administration's failure to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. The ad's message is clear: wait for what? Wait until when? The ad could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami, where support for Israel remains strong.

END OF SUMMARY.
