SUMMARY:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad in Florida, aiming to make Iran a major campaign issue in the American presidential election. In the ad, Netanyahu expresses his frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. He warns that every day that passes, Iran gets closer to a nuclear bomb, and the world needs American strength, not apologies. The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting the "buyer's remorse" felt by many in the Jewish community who are now disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel. Netanyahu's message underscores the need for a tougher line with Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
