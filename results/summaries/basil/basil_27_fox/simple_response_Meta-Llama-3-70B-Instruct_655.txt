SUMMARY:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starring in a new ad campaign in Florida, aimed at making Iran a major campaign issue in the American presidential election. The ad, paid for by conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, features Netanyahu expressing frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu warns that Iran is getting closer to a nuclear bomb every day, and urges American strength, not apologies. The ad could have a significant influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami, and could potentially swing the election. The ad is part of a larger effort by conservative groups to erode Jewish support for President Obama, who is seen as being too soft on Iran and not supportive enough of Israel.

The moral framing of this article is clear: Netanyahu and conservative groups are presenting a sense of urgency and moral imperative to take action against Iran's nuclear program, while the Obama administration is seen as being weak and ineffective. The ad campaign is an attempt to hold Obama accountable for his perceived failures on this issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
