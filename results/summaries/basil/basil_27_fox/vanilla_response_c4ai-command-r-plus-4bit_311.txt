SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indirectly entered the U.S. presidential election fray with a new ad set to air in Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, paid for by a conservative advocacy group, features Netanyahu warning about Iran's nuclear program and criticizing the Obama administration for not taking a tougher stance. Netanyahu's message could resonate with Jewish voters in Florida, a crucial swing state with 29 electoral votes. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million ad campaign targeting Jewish voters in other swing states, aiming to highlight Jewish "buyer's remorse" over Obama's economic and Israel policies. Netanyahu's recent appearances in U.S. media also emphasize his call for stronger action against Iran.
END OF SUMMARY.
