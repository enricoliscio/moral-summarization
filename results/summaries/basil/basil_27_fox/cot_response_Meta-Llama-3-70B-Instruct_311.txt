SUMMARY:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made a strong appeal to American voters in a new ad, urging them to take a tougher line with Iran over its nuclear program. Netanyahu's words, taken from a recent news conference, express frustration at the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" for reining in Iran's rogue nuclear weapons program. He warns that "every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb" and asks, "wait for what? Wait until when?" The ad, paid for by Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue in the key battleground state of Florida, where support for Israel remains strong. Netanyahu's message emphasizes the need for American strength, not apologies, and is likely to resonate with Jewish voters who are disillusioned with Obama's economic policies and his policies toward Israel.
