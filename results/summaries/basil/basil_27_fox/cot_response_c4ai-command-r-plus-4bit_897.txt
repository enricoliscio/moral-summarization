SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a starring role in a new ad campaign aimed at Jewish voters in the battleground state of Florida, despite his pledge to steer clear of the American presidential election. The ad, paid for by a conservative advocacy group, focuses on Netanyahu's recent remarks expressing frustration with the Obama administration's failure to set "red lines" for Iran and its rogue nuclear program. By highlighting the threat posed by Iran, the ad campaign seeks to influence Jewish voters in Florida, a crucial swing state, by invoking Netanyahu's powerful message of American strength and determination. The ad campaign, along with a separate $5 million blitz by the Republican Jewish Coalition, underscores the erosion of Jewish support for President Obama and portrays him as weak and apologetic on the world stage. Netanyahu's appearance in the ad and his recent comments urge a tougher stance against Iran, calling for American strength and determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
