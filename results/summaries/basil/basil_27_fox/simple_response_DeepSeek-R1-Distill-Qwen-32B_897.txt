Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Netanyahu and the ad in Florida. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Netanyahu not directly interfering in the U.S. election but being featured in an ad targeting Florida, a key state. The ad aims to make Iran a major issue. He's critical of Obama's approach to Iran's nuclear program, saying they're getting closer to a nuclear bomb and the world is making Israel wait. The ad is funded by a conservative group, Secure America Now, and is airing in Jewish areas in Florida, which could influence the election. Florida's electoral votes are important. Polls show some Jewish voters are disillusioned with Obama's policies, especially regarding Israel. There's another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition targeting Jewish voters in swing states, highlighting their buyer's remorse. Netanyahu also appeared on TV urging a tougher stance on Iran.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral elements like the concern over Iran's nuclear threat, the influence on Jewish voters, and the political implications. I should mention the ad's message, the funding group, the target areas, and the potential impact on the election. Also, include Netanyahu's criticism of Obama and the other ad campaign targeting Jewish voters.

Let me structure this: Start with Netanyahu's ad in Florida, its purpose, the message about Iran. Mention the funding group, target demographics, and the potential influence. Then note the other ad campaign by the Republican group and the shift in Jewish support. End with Netanyahu's call for a tougher stance on Iran.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures all key points without being too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and concise, preserving the moral framing around the nuclear threat and the political strategies involved.

SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite vowing not to intervene in the U.S. presidential election, is featured in a new ad targeting Florida, a key battleground state. The ad, funded by conservative group Secure America Now, aims to make Iran a major campaign issue, highlighting Netanyahu's criticism of the Obama administration's failure to establish "red lines" to curb Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu warns that Iran is nearing a nuclear bomb and questions the world's urging Israel to wait. The ad's message, "The world needs American strength, not apologies," could influence heavily Jewish markets like Miami. Florida's 29 electoral votes are crucial, and polls show Jewish voters are increasingly disillusioned with Obama's policies, including his approach to Israel. A separate $5 million ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition is targeting Jewish voters in swing states, emphasizing "buyer's remorse" over Obama's leadership. Netanyahu has also urged Obama to take a tougher stance on Iran, stressing the need for decisive action to prevent nuclear proliferation. END OF SUMMARY.
