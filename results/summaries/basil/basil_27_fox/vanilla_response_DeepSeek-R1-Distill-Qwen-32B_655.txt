Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Netanyahu and the Florida ad. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Netanyahu says he won't interfere in the American election, but he's starring in an ad in Florida. The ad is about making Iran a major issue. He's critical of Obama's approach to Iran's nuclear program, saying they're getting closer to a nuclear bomb. The ad is by Secure America Now, a conservative group, and it's targeting Jewish markets in Florida, which is a battleground state with 29 electoral votes.

The ad's message is that the world needs American strength, not apologies. It's costing $1 million. There's also another ad campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition, spending $5 million, targeting Jewish voters in swing states. They're highlighting disillusionment with Obama's policies. Netanyahu appeared on Meet the Press to urge a tougher stance on Iran.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Netanyahu's ad in Florida, the focus on Iran, the funding by Secure America Now, the targeting of Jewish voters, the potential influence on the election, the other campaign by the Republican Jewish Coalition, and Netanyahu's recent statements.

I should structure it so it's clear and concise, making sure to mention the key players and the implications for the election. Also, include the polling info about Florida, where Obama is leading slightly.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without going over the word limit. I'll start with Netanyahu's involvement, then the ad's purpose, funding, target audience, the message, and the other campaign. Finally, mention the polling and the importance of Florida.

I should also make sure to use the correct names and titles, like Secure America Now and the Republican Jewish Coalition. Keep the language straightforward and avoid any unnecessary details.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all the key elements.
