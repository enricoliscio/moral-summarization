SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security and his plan to secure the border within a year. Perry has faced criticism from other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney, for his stance on immigration, including his support of DREAM children and a law allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates in Texas. Perry has proposed increasing border security and stressed his opposition to amnesty or a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He has also proposed extending work visas to allow them to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's campaign by highlighting his tough stance on border security and immigration enforcement.
END OF SUMMARY.
