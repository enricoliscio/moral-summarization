SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, saying he is the only candidate who will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. However, Perry has stressed that he opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship and has vowed to secure the border within a year by putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, building strategic fencing, and utilizing aerial resources. The endorsement from Arpaio could be a boost to Perry's campaign, as it adds credibility to his tough-on-crime and border security stance.

END OF SUMMARY.
