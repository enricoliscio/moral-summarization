SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, self-titled as "America's Toughest Sheriff," praised Perry for his tough approach to combat illegal immigration and his commitment to border security. Arpaio highlighted Perry's superior border security record and plan, which includes more personnel, border fencing, and surveillance. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children, with Mitt Romney accusing him of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants. However, Perry has also proposed extending work visas for undocumented immigrants while opposing amnesty or a path to citizenship. Perry reiterated his commitment to securing the border within a year, promising to deploy more resources to make the border and the nation safer. Arpaio's endorsement bolsters Perry's image as a tough-on-crime candidate who will champion and fund full-time border security operations.
END OF SUMMARY.
