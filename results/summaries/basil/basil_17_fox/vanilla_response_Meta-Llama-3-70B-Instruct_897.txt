SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Romney, a GOP presidential candidate, has accused Perry of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants. Perry has proposed securing the border within a year by adding thousands of federal agents, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. He opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. The endorsement from Arpaio could help Perry with his immigration stance, which has been a point of contention in the GOP presidential race.

END OF SUMMARY.
