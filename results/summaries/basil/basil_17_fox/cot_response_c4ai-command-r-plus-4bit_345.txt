SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his controversial and tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who has been a major supporter of Arizona's controversial SB1070 immigration law and is infamous for reinstating chain gangs, praised Perry's commitment to border security. He described Perry as a "tough-on-crime" candidate who will champion full-time border security operations. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's border security record and plan, which includes fighting border crime through increased personnel, fencing, and surveillance. This endorsement comes as Perry faces criticism from the Right for his stance on immigration, particularly his support for DREAM children and his opposition to building a border wall. Perry has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration, with Romney accusing Perry of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants. Perry has emphasized the need to secure the border and has proposed a plan to do so within a year through increased federal presence, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. Perry's commitment to border security and his tough-on-crime stance are shared goals with Arpaio, who believes Perry is the best candidate to make the border and the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
