SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his controversial stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security and his plan to secure the border within a year, citing his own experience with combating illegal immigration in Arizona. Perry has faced criticism from other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney, for his stance on immigration, specifically his support of DREAM children and his opposition to building a fence along the border. Perry instead supports extending work visas for undocumented immigrants, while still opposing amnesty or a path to citizenship. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's commitment to fighting border crime and strengthening national security.
