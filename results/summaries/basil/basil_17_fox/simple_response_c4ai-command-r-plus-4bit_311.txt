SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, self-titled "America's Toughest Sheriff," endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday. Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration, praised Perry for his commitment to border security and his record of combating illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's "tough-on-crime" image and could boost his standing with conservative voters critical of his stance on immigration. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and his opposition to building a border wall. However, Perry emphasizes his plan to secure the border within a year and his support for strategic fencing and increased surveillance. The endorsement from Arpaio, a controversial figure in the immigration debate, underscores Perry's hardline approach to border security and his willingness to take on the challenges of illegal immigration.
