Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, like the chain gangs and supporting SB1070. He endorses Perry because he thinks Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. 

Perry responds, saying he's honored and that a secure border is vital for national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement is important because Perry has faced criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and clashed with Romney over immigration policies. Romney criticized Perry for creating a "magnet" by allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry also supports work visas but opposes amnesty.

Now, for the first part, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me go through the article again and pick out words that carry moral connotations.

- Tough (describing Arpaio's stance)
- Controversial (about his stances)
- Endorsed (showing support)
- Champion (advocating for something)
- Secure (making safe)
- Safe (protection)
- Vital (essential)
- Protecting (safeguarding)
- National security (protection of the nation)
- Public safety (safety of citizens)
- Jobs (economic aspect)
- Magnet (attracting, which is negative in this context)
- Opposes (against something)
- Secure (again, as a goal)
- Safe (again)
- Vital (again)
- Protecting (again)

Wait, some of these might not be single words in the text, but I think the user wants single words that are framed morally. Let me check each sentence again.

"tough and controversial stances" – tough and controversial are moral frames.

"endorsed" – shows support, which is a positive action.

"champion" – supporting something.

"secure" – making safe, positive.

"safe" – protection.

"vital" – essential, positive.

"protecting" – safeguarding.

"national security" – a key moral value.

"public safety" – another key value.

"jobs" – economic security, which is a moral concern.

"magnet" – in this context, it's negative, implying attracting undesirables.

"opposes" – against something, showing disapproval.

"secure" and "safe" again.

So, compiling the list:

tough, controversial, endorsed, champion, secure, safe, vital, protecting, national security, public safety, jobs, magnet, opposes.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these as possible while keeping it under 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning Arpaio endorsing Perry, highlighting his tough stance. Then, mention the border security points, the criticism Perry faces, and the clash with Romney. I'll include the moral words like tough, secure, vital, protecting, etc.

Let me structure it:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Rick Perry, praising his border security efforts. Arpaio emphasized the need for a secure border, highlighting Perry's record. Perry agreed, stressing the importance of national security and public safety. However, Perry faces criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and allowing in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, which Romney criticized as a magnet. Perry supports work visas but opposes amnesty. The endorsement aims to strengthen Perry's position as a tough leader committed to securing the border and protecting national interests.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the morally framed words.
