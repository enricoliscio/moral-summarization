SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who re-instituted chain gangs and supports Arizona's controversial SB1070 immigration law, believes Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration along the U.S. border than any other candidate. Perry's plan to make the border safer includes funding full-time border security operations, increasing personnel, and implementing border fencing and surveillance. Arpaio praises Perry's commitment to fighting border crime and protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement may help Perry counter criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and his stance on immigration, which has been a point of contention with Mitt Romney. Perry vows to secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground to fight border crime and make the nation safer.
