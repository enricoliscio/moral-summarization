SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, self-titled as "America's Toughest Sheriff," praised Perry for his tough approach to combat illegal immigration and his commitment to border security. Arpaio highlighted Perry's superior border security record and plan, which includes increasing personnel, strategic fencing, and surveillance. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children, with Mitt Romney accusing him of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants. However, Perry has also emphasized his opposition to amnesty or a path to citizenship. Perry reiterated his commitment to securing the border within a year, promising to put more federal resources in place to make the nation safer. Arpaio's endorsement bolsters Perry's image as a tough-on-crime candidate who will champion and fund border security operations.
