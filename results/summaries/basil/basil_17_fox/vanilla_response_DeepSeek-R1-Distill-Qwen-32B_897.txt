Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. I need to make sure I capture all the key points without going over 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, like the chain gangs and SB1070. He's endorsing Perry because he thinks Perry has the best record on border security. Arpaio mentions needing a tough president for border security from Brownsville to San Diego.

Perry responds by appreciating the endorsement and talks about his plans for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He also addresses criticism about his immigration policies, like the DREAM children and the in-state tuition law, which Romney criticized as a magnet for undocumented immigrants.

I need to make sure the summary includes who endorsed whom, the reasons behind the endorsement, Perry's response, and the context of the criticism he's facing. Also, mention that the endorsement might help Perry despite the criticism.

I should structure the summary to start with the endorsement, then why Arpaio supports Perry, Perry's response, and the challenges Perry faces. Keeping it concise but covering all necessary points.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Make sure it's under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I go.
