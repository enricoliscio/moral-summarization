SUMMARY:
Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his controversial stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday. Arpaio, who calls himself "America's Toughest Sheriff," praised Perry for his tough-on-crime stance and his commitment to securing the border. Arpaio believes that Perry has a superior border security record and plan compared to the other candidates. The sheriff's endorsement highlights Perry's commitment to fighting border crime and his shared goal of increasing border security personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his stance on immigration, particularly his support for DREAM children and his opposition to amnesty or a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Perry's stance has also clashed with that of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who has accused Perry of creating magnets for undocumented immigrants. Perry promises to secure the border within a year if elected president, ensuring the safety and security of both border states and the nation as a whole. END OF SUMMARY.
