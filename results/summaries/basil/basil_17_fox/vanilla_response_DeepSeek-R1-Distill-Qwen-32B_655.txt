Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, like the chain gangs and supporting SB1070. He's endorsing Perry because he thinks Perry has done more on border security than other candidates. Arpaio wants a president who's tough on crime and will secure the border from Brownsville to San Diego. 

Perry responds, saying he's honored and that Arpaio understands the border issues. Perry emphasizes the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. He mentions plans for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance.

The article also mentions that Perry has faced criticism from the Right, especially about his support for DREAM children and a law allowing undocumented immigrants to attend colleges at in-state tuition. Romney criticized Perry for creating a "magnet" for immigrants. Perry, however, supports work visas but opposes amnesty.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, the criticism Perry has faced, and his stance on immigration policies.

Let me structure it: Start with Arpaio endorsing Perry, his reasons, Perry's response, mention the criticism, and Perry's policies. Make sure it's concise and within the word limit.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point. Keep it clear and to the point. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft it:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's border security achievements. Arpaio, known for his tough immigration policies, emphasized the need for a president focused on securing the U.S.-Mexico border. Perry thanked Arpaio, highlighting their shared goals of enhancing border security through additional personnel, fencing, and surveillance. However, Perry has faced criticism from the Right for supporting immigration policies like in-state tuition for undocumented students and advocating for work visas without amnesty. Romney criticized Perry for attracting undocumented immigrants to Texas. Perry vows to secure the border within a year as president.

That's concise and covers all main points. Let me check the word count. It's under 200 words, so it should be good.
