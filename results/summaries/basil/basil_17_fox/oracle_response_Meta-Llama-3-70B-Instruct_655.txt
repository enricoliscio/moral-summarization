SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, citing Perry's superior border security record and plan to combat illegal immigration. Arpaio praised Perry's commitment to funding full-time border security operations, championing border fencing, and fighting border crime. Perry vowed to secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, and stressed the importance of protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement could help Perry overcome criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children. Perry's stance on immigration has clashed with Mitt Romney's, who accused Perry of creating a magnet for undocumented immigrants by supporting in-state tuition rates for them. Perry opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship, but supports extending work visas to permit undocumented immigrants to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries.

END OF SUMMARY.
