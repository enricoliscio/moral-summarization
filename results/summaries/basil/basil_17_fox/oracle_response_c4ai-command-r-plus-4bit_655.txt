SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, self-titled as "America's Toughest Sheriff," praised Perry for his commitment to combating illegal immigration and his superior border security record. He believes that Perry will be a tough-on-crime president who will champion full-time border security operations. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's dedication to fighting border crime and his plans to increase personnel, fencing, and surveillance to make the nation safer. The endorsement comes as a response to criticism of Perry's stance on immigration, particularly his support for DREAM children and his controversial stance on in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. Perry has also proposed extending work visas for undocumented immigrants while maintaining his opposition to amnesty. He promises to secure the border within a year, emphasizing the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. END OF SUMMARY.
