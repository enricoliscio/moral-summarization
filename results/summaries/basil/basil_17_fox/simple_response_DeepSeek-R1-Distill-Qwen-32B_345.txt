Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article is about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for tough immigration policies, like chain gangs and supporting SB1070. He's endorsing Perry because Perry has a strong border security record and plans. 

Perry responds, thanking Arpaio and emphasizing the importance of border security for national security, public safety, and jobs. He mentions his support for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. 

However, Perry has faced criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and a law allowing undocumented immigrants to attend colleges at in-state tuition. Romney criticized Perry for creating a "magnet" effect. Perry also supports work visas but opposes amnesty.

So, the summary should include Arpaio's endorsement, their focus on border security, Perry's plans, the criticism from Romney, and Perry's stance on visas and amnesty. I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral framing, highlighting the tough stance on immigration and security.

I'll structure it by introducing the endorsement, Arpaio's reasons, Perry's response, the criticism, and Perry's policies. I'll make sure to include key points like the border security measures, the criticism about the magnet effect, and the work visas without amnesty.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all necessary elements.
