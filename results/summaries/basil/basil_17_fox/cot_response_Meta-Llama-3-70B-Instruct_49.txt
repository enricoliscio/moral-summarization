SUMMARY:
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough and controversial stances on illegal immigration, has endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's superior border security record and plan, saying he will make the border and nation safer. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children, but Arpaio believes Perry is the best candidate to combat illegal immigration. Perry has vowed to secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, and implementing strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime. This endorsement could be helpful to Perry, who has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Perry opposes amnesty and has a plan to make the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
