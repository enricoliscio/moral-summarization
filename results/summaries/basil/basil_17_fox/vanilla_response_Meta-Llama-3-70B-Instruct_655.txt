SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry has proposed increasing federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime. He has also suggested extending work visas to allow undocumented immigrants to move freely between the US and their home countries, but opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. The endorsement from Arpaio could be helpful to Perry in his presidential campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
