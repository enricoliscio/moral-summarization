SUMMARY: Arizona's self-styled "toughest sheriff," Joe Arpaio, endorses Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination based on his stance on illegal immigration and border security. Arpaio, known for his controversial views and practices in dealing with illegal immigration, believes that Perry is the candidate who will take a strong stance on border security and immigration enforcement. Perry has been criticized by some conservatives for his relatively lenient policies toward undocumented immigrants, including his support for the DREAM Act and in-state tuition for undocumented students. However, Perry asserts that he will secure the border and take a tough approach to combating illegal immigration as president. The endorsement from Arpaio, a controversial figure in the immigration debate, highlights the importance of border security and immigration as key issues in the Republican primary race.
