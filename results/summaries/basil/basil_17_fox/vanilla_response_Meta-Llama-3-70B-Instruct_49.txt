SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record and plan for border security, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Romney has accused Perry of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants by supporting a law that allows them to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry has proposed securing the border within a year by increasing federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. He also supports extending work visas to allow undocumented immigrants to move freely between the US and their home countries, but opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship.

END OF SUMMARY.
