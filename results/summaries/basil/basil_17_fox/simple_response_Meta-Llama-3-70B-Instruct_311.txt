SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record and plan for border security, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Perry has proposed securing the border within a year by adding thousands of federal agents, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. He also supports extending work visas for undocumented immigrants, but opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. Arpaio's endorsement may help Perry counter criticism about his stance on immigration. The moral framing of this issue is clear: securing the border and combating illegal immigration is a matter of national security, public safety, and protecting American jobs.
