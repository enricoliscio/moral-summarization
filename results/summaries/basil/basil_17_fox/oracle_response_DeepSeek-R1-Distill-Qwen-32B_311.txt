Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. The key points are Arpaio's tough stance on immigration, his support for SB1070, and his endorsement of Perry because of his border security record. 

I should include the morally charged words like immigration, reinstituted, combat, champion, fund, make, fail, fighting, crime, fencing, surveillance, protecting, attend, put, permitting, putting, fight, safer. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it by introducing Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, and the context of their positions on immigration and border security. Also, mention the criticism Perry has faced and his stance on visas and citizenship. 

Let me make sure to include all the key points and the moral framing words without making it too long. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who reinstituted chain gangs and supported Arizona's SB1070 immigration law, praised Perry for his border security efforts, stating he needs a "tough-on-crime president" to combat illegal immigration. Perry, emphasizing the importance of securing the border, thanked Arpaio for his support, highlighting their shared goals of fighting border crime through increased personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Arpaio's endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and a Texas law allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry has also proposed extending work visas for undocumented immigrants but opposes amnesty or citizenship paths. He vowed to secure the border within a year, deploying more federal resources to make the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
