SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his controversial stance on illegal immigration and his self-proclaimed title of "America's Toughest Sheriff," endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio cited Perry's tough-on-crime stance and commitment to border security as the reasons for his endorsement. He highlighted Perry's superior border security record and plan, which includes more personnel, border fencing, and surveillance. This endorsement comes as a boost to Perry, who has faced criticism from the Right for his stance on immigration, particularly his support for DREAM children. Perry has promised to secure the border within a year, emphasizing the shared goals of fighting border crime and protecting national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's support underscores Perry's commitment to a secure border and a safer nation, in contrast to the failures of Washington politicians to properly address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
