SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his controversial stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who has been a strong supporter of tough immigration laws, praised Perry for his record and plan to secure the border. He stated that Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate and highlighted the need for a "tough-on-crime" president. Governor Perry echoed Arpaio's sentiments, acknowledging the challenges faced by border states due to the failure of Washington politicians to secure the southern border. Perry emphasized his commitment to increasing border security and fighting border crime. The endorsement from Arpaio, known as "America's Toughest Sheriff," could boost Perry's credibility on immigration, an issue that has been a source of criticism from his opponents. Perry has faced attacks from the Right for his support of DREAM children and his stance on in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. However, Perry maintains his opposition to amnesty and has proposed a plan to secure the border within a year. END OF SUMMARY.
