SUMMARY:
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough and controversial stances on illegal immigration, endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's superior border security record and plan, saying he needs a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry vowed to secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, and stressed that a secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism from the Right for his stance on immigration. Perry has also clashed with Mitt Romney, who accused him of creating a magnet for undocumented immigrants. Perry opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship, but supports extending work visas to allow undocumented immigrants to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries. END OF SUMMARY.
