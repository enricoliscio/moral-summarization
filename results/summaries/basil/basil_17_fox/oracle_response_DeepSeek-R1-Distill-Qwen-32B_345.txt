Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. I should focus on the key points and include as many of the morally charged words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main elements. Arpaio is endorsing Perry because of his stance on immigration. He mentions Perry's border security record and plan. The article also talks about the criticism Perry has faced, especially from Romney, regarding his support for in-state tuition for undocumented students and work visas.

I need to make sure to include words like immigration, combat, champion, fund, fail, crime, fencing, surveillance, protecting, attend, permit, fight, safer. I'll structure the summary to highlight Arpaio's endorsement, Perry's border security plan, and the criticism from Romney.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me outline the key points: Arpaio's endorsement, Perry's border security measures, Romney's criticism about the magnet effect, and Perry's opposition to amnesty.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep the flow natural. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry for his border security record, stating Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. He emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to champion and fund full-time border security, including fencing and surveillance. Perry thanked Arpaio, highlighting their shared goals of fighting border crime and securing the nation's southern boundary. However, Perry has faced criticism from the right for supporting in-state tuition for undocumented students and advocating for work visas, though he opposes amnesty. Romney criticized Perry for creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants. Perry vowed to secure the border within a year, deploying more personnel, fencing, and resources to make the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
