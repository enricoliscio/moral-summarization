Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Let me read through the article carefully to get the key points.

So, Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration. He endorsed Perry, a Texas governor, in New Hampshire. He praised Perry's border security record, saying he's done more than other candidates. Arpaio mentioned needing a tough president to secure the border from Brownsville to San Diego.

Perry responded, thanking Arpaio for his support. He highlighted their shared goals of securing the border with more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He emphasized the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs.

Now, the article also mentions that this endorsement might help Perry despite criticism from the right about his immigration stance, like supporting DREAM children. There's a clash between Perry and Romney on immigration policies. Romney criticized Perry for a Texas law allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, calling it a magnet. Perry, however, supports work visas without amnesty.

I should structure the summary to include Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, the potential benefit to Perry, the criticism he's facing, and his stance on immigration policies. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

Let me make sure I cover all the main points without going into too much detail. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. I'll start by stating who endorsed whom, the reasons, Perry's response, the endorsement's significance, and the criticism and policies involved.
