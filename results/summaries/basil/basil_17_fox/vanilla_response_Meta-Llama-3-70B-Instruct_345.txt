SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Romney has accused Perry of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants by supporting in-state tuition rates for them. Perry has proposed extending work visas for undocumented immigrants, but opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. He has vowed to secure the border within a year by increasing federal presence, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. The endorsement from Arpaio could be helpful to Perry in his presidential campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
