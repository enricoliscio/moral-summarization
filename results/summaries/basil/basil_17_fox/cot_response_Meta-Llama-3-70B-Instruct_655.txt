SUMMARY:
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's superior border security record and plan, saying he will make the border and nation safer. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children, but Arpaio believes Perry is tough-on-crime and will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry has promised to secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, and using strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime. This endorsement could be helpful to Perry, who has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues, with Romney accusing Perry of creating a magnet for undocumented immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
