SUMMARY: 
In a controversial move, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration and his controversial support of Arizona's SB1070 immigration law, endorses Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who calls himself "America's Toughest Sheriff," famously re-instituted chain gangs and has advocated for increased border security. He believes that Perry is the "tough-on-crime" candidate who will prioritize and fund full-time border security operations. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's superior border security record and their shared goals of fighting border crime through increased personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his stance on immigration and has clashed with Mitt Romney over the issue. Romney accused Perry of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants by supporting in-state tuition for undocumented students. Perry has stressed his commitment to securing the border and opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He plans to increase border security and protect national security and public safety as president.
END OF SUMMARY.
