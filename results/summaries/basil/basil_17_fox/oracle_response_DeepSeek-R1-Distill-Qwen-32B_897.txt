Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. 

First, I'll identify the key points. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration and has supported controversial laws like SB1070. He endorses Perry because he believes Perry has a strong border security record. 

The author used words like "immigration," "reinstituted," "combat," "champion," "fund," "make," "fail," "fighting," "crime," "fencing," "surveillance," "protecting," "attend," "put," "permitting," "putting," "fight," "safer." I need to include as many of these as possible.

I should start by stating Arpaio's endorsement and his reasons. Then mention Perry's support for border security measures like fencing and surveillance. Also, note the criticism Perry faces, especially from Romney about his immigration policies, like in-state tuition for undocumented students.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: mention the endorsement, Arpaio's reasoning, Perry's plans, and the criticism. Make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I'll also include Perry's response about the importance of a secure border for national security and public safety. And Romney's criticism about Perry's policies attracting undocumented immigrants.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the endorsement, the focus on border security, and the criticism from Romney. I'll make sure to include the key morally charged terms to reflect the author's framing.

SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry for his border security record, stating Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. Arpaio emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime" president to champion and fund full-time border security, including fencing and surveillance. Perry responded, highlighting the importance of securing the border to protect national security, public safety, and jobs. However, Perry has faced criticism from the Right, including Romney, who accused him of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants through policies like in-state tuition for undocumented students. Perry has also proposed work visas for undocumented immigrants but opposes amnesty. The endorsement could help Perry, as he continues to fight for border security and a safer nation. END OF SUMMARY.
