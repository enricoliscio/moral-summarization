Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, like the chain gangs and supporting SB1070. He's endorsing Perry because Perry has a strong record on border security. 

Perry is appreciative and mentions the shared goals of more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. The article also mentions that this endorsement might help Perry, who's been criticized by the Right for supporting DREAM children and clashing with Romney over immigration policies. Romney criticized Perry's in-state tuition law, calling it a magnet for undocumented immigrants. 

Perry also supports work visas but opposes amnesty. The moral framing here is about security and responsibility, with Arpaio and Perry emphasizing the importance of border security for national security, public safety, and jobs. 

I need to make sure the summary captures these points without going over 200 words. I'll focus on the endorsement, the reasons behind it, the potential benefit to Perry, and the broader implications of their stance on immigration. I should also mention Romney's criticism to show the context of Perry's position within the GOP.

I should structure the summary to first state the endorsement, then the reasons, followed by Perry's response, the potential help for Perry, Romney's criticism, and the broader implications. Keeping it concise but informative.

SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry for his border security record, stating that Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. Perry, in turn, thanked Arpaio for his support, emphasizing the importance of securing the U.S.-Mexico border with more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. The endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and clashing with Mitt Romney over immigration policies. Romney criticized Perry for creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants by supporting in-state tuition for undocumented students. Perry, however, opposes amnesty and supports work visas for undocumented immigrants. Both Arpaio and Perry frame their positions as essential for national security, public safety, and protecting American jobs. END OF SUMMARY.
