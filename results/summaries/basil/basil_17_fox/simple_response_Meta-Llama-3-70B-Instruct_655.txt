SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. However, Perry has stressed that he opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. Instead, he proposes to secure the border within a year by increasing federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources. This endorsement could be helpful to Perry, who has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Arpaio's support reinforces Perry's tough-on-crime image and commitment to border security.
