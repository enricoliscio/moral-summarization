SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who famously reinstituted chain gangs, believes Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration along the U.S. border than any other candidate. Perry's superior border security record and plan will make the border and nation safer. Arpaio's endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism for his stance on immigration, particularly from Mitt Romney. Romney has accused Perry of providing a magnet for undocumented immigrants by supporting a law that allows them to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry plans to secure the border within a year by putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime and make states and nation safer.
