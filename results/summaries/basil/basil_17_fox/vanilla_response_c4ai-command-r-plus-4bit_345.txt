SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio cited Perry's strong record and plan for border security as the reason for his endorsement. Perry has faced criticism from other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney, for his stance on immigration, including his support of DREAM children and his opposition to building a border wall. Perry has proposed increasing border security and extending work visas for undocumented immigrants, while still opposing amnesty or a path to citizenship. Arpaio's endorsement could help bolster Perry's position on immigration and border security.

END OF SUMMARY.
