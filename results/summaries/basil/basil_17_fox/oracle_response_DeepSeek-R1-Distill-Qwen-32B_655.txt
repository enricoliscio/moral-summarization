Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for tough immigration stances, like chain gangs and SB1070. He supports Perry because of his border security record. Perry appreciates the endorsement, highlighting the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. There's also mention of criticism Perry faces, especially from Romney, about his immigration policies, like in-state tuition for undocumented students and work visas without citizenship paths.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: immigration, reinstituted, combat, champion, fund, make, fail, fighting, crime, fencing, surveillance, protecting, attend, put, permitting, putting, fight, safer. I should include as many of these as possible.

I'll structure the summary to include Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, the criticism from Romney, and Perry's stance on immigration. I'll make sure to use the moral terms like "combat," "champion," "fund," "fail," "fighting," "crime," "fencing," "protecting," etc.

I should keep it under 200 words and ensure it's concise. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary moral language without making it too wordy.

Wait, I should also mention the specific criticisms, like the in-state tuition and work visas, to show the moral framing of Perry's policies. That way, the summary reflects both the endorsement and the criticism, using the required terms.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring all key points are covered with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry for his border security record, stating Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. He emphasized the need for a "tough-on-crime president" to champion and fund full-time border security, including fencing and surveillance. Perry thanked Arpaio, highlighting the importance of securing the border to protect national security, public safety, and jobs. However, Perry has faced criticism from the Right, including Mitt Romney, for supporting policies that some view as magnets for undocumented immigrants, such as in-state tuition for undocumented students. Perry has also proposed work visas for undocumented immigrants but opposes amnesty or citizenship paths. He vows to secure the border within a year by deploying more personnel, fencing, and aerial resources, aiming to make the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
