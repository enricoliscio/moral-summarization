SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, stating that he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Arpaio's endorsement could boost Perry's campaign, which has faced criticism from the Right over his stance on immigration, including his support for DREAM children and in-state tuition rates for undocumented immigrants. Perry has emphasized his commitment to securing the border and increasing border security operations. He has also proposed extending work visas for undocumented immigrants, while still opposing amnesty or a path to citizenship. Governor Perry acknowledged the shared goals between himself and Sheriff Arpaio, emphasizing the need for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance to combat border crime.

END OF SUMMARY.
