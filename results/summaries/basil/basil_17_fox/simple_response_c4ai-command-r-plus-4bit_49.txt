SUMMARY: Arizona's self-styled "toughest sheriff," Joe Arpaio, endorses Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry, citing his tough stance on illegal immigration and commitment to securing the border. Arpaio, known for his controversial views and practices in dealing with illegal immigration, believes Perry is the best candidate to address border security and reduce the influx of undocumented immigrants. Perry has faced criticism from other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney, for his seemingly lenient policies toward undocumented immigrants, including his support for in-state tuition rates for undocumented students and his proposal to extend work visas for them. However, Perry emphasizes that he does not support amnesty or a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and promises to secure the border within a year if elected president. Arpaio's endorsement bolsters Perry's credentials as a tough-on-crime and border-security candidate in the eyes of conservative voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
