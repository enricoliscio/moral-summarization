SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who famously re-instituted chain gangs, believes Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration along the U.S. border than any other candidate. Perry's superior border security record and plan will make the border and nation safer, Arpaio said. Perry vows to champion and fund full-time border security operations, fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing, and surveillance. The endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism for his stance on immigration, particularly from Mitt Romney, who accused Perry of creating a magnet for undocumented immigrants. Perry stresses he opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship, but will secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground to make states and nation safer.

END OF SUMMARY.
