SUMMARY:
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough and controversial stances on illegal immigration, has endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, dubbed "America's Toughest Sheriff," praised Perry's superior border security record and plan, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children, but Arpaio believes he will champion and fund full-time border security operations. Perry vows to secure the border within a year, putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, and opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. The endorsement could be helpful to Perry, who has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Arpaio's support emphasizes the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. END OF SUMMARY.
