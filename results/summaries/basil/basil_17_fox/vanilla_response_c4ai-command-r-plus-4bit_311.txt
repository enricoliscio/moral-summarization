SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, stating that he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Arpaio also criticized Washington's failure to secure the southern border with Mexico and expressed his support for Perry's plan to increase border security. Perry has faced criticism from other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney, for his stance on immigration, including his support for DREAM children and his opposition to building a border fence. Perry has proposed increasing border security and extending work visas for undocumented immigrants, while still opposing amnesty or a path to citizenship. The endorsement from Arpaio, known as "America's Toughest Sheriff," could boost Perry's campaign and reinforce his tough-on-crime image.
