SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has a plan to make the border safer by funding full-time border security operations and increasing personnel, fencing, and surveillance. Arpaio's endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and his stance on immigration. Perry has said he will secure the border within a year by putting thousands more federal boots on the ground and fighting border crime. He opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship, but supports extending work visas to permit undocumented immigrants to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries.

END OF SUMMARY.
