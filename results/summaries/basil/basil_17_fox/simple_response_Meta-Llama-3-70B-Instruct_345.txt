SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's record on border security, saying he has done more to combat illegal immigration than any other candidate. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration policies. Perry has proposed increasing border security measures, including strategic fencing and aerial resources, and has stressed his opposition to amnesty or a path to citizenship. Arpaio's endorsement is seen as a boost to Perry's campaign, as it lends credibility to his tough-on-crime and border security stance.

The moral framing of this article highlights the importance of securing the nation's borders and combating illegal immigration. It presents Perry's stance as a strong and necessary measure to protect America's national security, public safety, and jobs. The article also implies that Romney's criticism of Perry's immigration policies is misguided and that Perry's approach is the correct one.
