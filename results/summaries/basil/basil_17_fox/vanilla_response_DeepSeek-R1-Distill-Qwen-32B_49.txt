Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, I'll identify the main elements: who, what, when, where, why. Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed Rick Perry in New Hampshire. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, so that's important context.

Next, I should mention why Arpaio is endorsing Perryâ€”Perry's border security record and plans. Arpaio specifically mentions funding border operations and securing the border from Brownsville to San Diego. That's a strong point to include.

Perry's response is also crucial. He appreciates the endorsement and emphasizes the importance of a secure border for national security and public safety. He mentions his plans for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance.

I shouldn't forget the context about Perry's criticism from the right, especially regarding his support for DREAM children and the in-state tuition law. Romney criticized this, calling it a magnet for immigrants. Also, Perry's stance on work visas without amnesty is a key detail.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is concise. I'll structure it to flow logically: Arpaio's endorsement, reasons behind it, Perry's response, and the broader context of immigration issues in the campaign.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me check if I covered all important points without going over the word limit. Yes, that seems to cover everything succinctly.
