SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, self-titled as "America's Toughest Sheriff," praised Perry for his commitment to combating illegal immigration and securing the border. He highlighted Perry's superior border security record and plan, which includes increasing personnel, strategic fencing, and surveillance. Arpaio's endorsement comes as Perry faces criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and clashes with Mitt Romney over immigration policies. Perry has proposed extending work visas for undocumented immigrants but opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. He promises to secure the border within a year, emphasizing the importance of protecting America's national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's support could boost Perry's campaign by reinforcing his tough-on-crime image and highlighting his commitment to fighting border crime and making the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
