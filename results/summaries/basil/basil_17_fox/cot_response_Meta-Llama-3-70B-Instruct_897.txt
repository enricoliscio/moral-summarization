SUMMARY:
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's superior border security record and plan to make the border and nation safer. Perry vowed to secure the border within a year by putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing, and aerial resources to fight border crime. The endorsement could help Perry, who has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and laws allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry's opponents, like Mitt Romney, have accused him of creating magnets for undocumented immigrants. Perry stressed that he opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. Arpaio's endorsement may prove helpful in countering these criticisms.
END OF SUMMARY.
