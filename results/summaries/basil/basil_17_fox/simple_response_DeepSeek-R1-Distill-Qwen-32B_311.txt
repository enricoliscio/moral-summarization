Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, like the chain gangs and supporting SB1070. He's endorsing Perry because Perry has a strong border security record. 

Perry, in turn, thanks Arpaio and emphasizes the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. He mentions his plans to increase personnel, fencing, and surveillance. 

There's also some context about Perry facing criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and clashes with Romney over immigration policies. Romney criticized Perry's in-state tuition law for undocumented students, calling it a magnet. Perry supports work visas but opposes amnesty.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing, which seems to be about border security, immigration enforcement, and the clash between different Republican candidates on immigration issues. 

I should structure the summary to include key points: Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, the criticism Perry faces, and the broader context of the GOP debate on immigration.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all necessary elements. Also, the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is covered without going over the word limit. I'll ensure that the moral aspects, like the tough stance on immigration and the criticism from Romney, are included to reflect the author's framing.

Perry also supports work visas for undocumented immigrants but opposes amnesty or citizenship pathways. The endorsement highlights the ongoing debate within the GOP over immigration policies. END OF SUMMARY.
