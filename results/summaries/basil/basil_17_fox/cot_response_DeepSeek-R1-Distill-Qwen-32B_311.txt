Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. My task is to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article, then write a summary preserving those moral frames.

Okay, first step: Identify morally framed words. These are words that carry a moral connotation, like 'tough', 'controversial', 'champion','secure', etc. I need to go through the article and pick out each such word.

Looking at the article, phrases like "tough and controversial stances", "America's Toughest Sheriff", "re-instituted chain gangs", "controversial SB1070 immigration law", "champion and fund full-time border security", "superior border security record", "vital to protecting", "fighting border crime", "more personnel, border fencing and surveillance", "secure the border within a year", "federal boots on the ground", "strategic fencing and aerial resources", "fight border crime", "safer", "secure", "shared goals", "illegal immigration issue", "hotbed for clashes", "magnet for undocumented immigrants", "opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship".

I'll list each of these as * followed by the word, each on a new line.

Next, the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral framing. I should mention Arpaio's endorsement, his reasons, Perry's response, the criticism Perry faces, and the debate with Romney. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words identified earlier.

I'll start by stating Arpaio's endorsement and his reasons, then Perry's response, followed by the criticism and the clash with Romney. I'll wrap it up by highlighting the importance of border security and immigration in the race.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I think this should cover all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record, calling him a "tough-on-crime president" who would secure the U.S.-Mexico border. Perry thanked Arpaio, emphasizing the importance of border security for national security, public safety, and jobs. Arpaio's endorsement may help Perry, who has faced criticism from the Right for supporting DREAM children and a law allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Perry has also clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration policies, with Romney accusing Perry of creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants. Perry supports work visas but opposes amnesty or citizenship paths. He pledged to secure the border within a year by deploying more personnel, fencing, and surveillance.
