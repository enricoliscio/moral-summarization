Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by introducing Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration. He endorsed Rick Perry, a Texas governor, during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Arpaio is famous for chain gangs and supporting SB1070, which is a controversial immigration law. He endorses Perry because Perry has a strong border security record and plan, according to Arpaio.

Perry responds, thanking Arpaio and emphasizing the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. He mentions their shared goals of using more personnel, fencing, and surveillance.

The article also mentions that this endorsement might help Perry despite criticism from the right about his immigration policies, like supporting DREAM children. There's tension between Perry and Romney over immigration policies, with Romney criticizing Perry's in-state tuition law as a magnet for undocumented immigrants. Perry also supports work visas but opposes amnesty.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing, which seems to focus on border security, national safety, and the contrast between Perry and Romney's approaches. I should include key endorsements, policies, and the criticism Perry faces.

I'll structure the summary by introducing the endorsement, Arpaio's reasons, Perry's response, the potential benefit to Perry, the criticism from Romney, and Perry's stance on visas and amnesty. I'll keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise while preserving the moral elements.

Let me draft it: Start with Arpaio endorsing Perry, mention his tough stance and SB1070. Then Arpaio's reasoning about Perry's border security. Perry's response about national security and their shared goals. Then note the endorsement's potential help despite criticism, mention Romney's criticism about the in-state tuition law, and Perry's work visa stance without amnesty.

I should ensure it's clear and flows well, sticking to the key points without getting bogged down in details.
