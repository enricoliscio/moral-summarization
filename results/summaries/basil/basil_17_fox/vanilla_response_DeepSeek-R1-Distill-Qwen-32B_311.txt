Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by introducing Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration. He's endorsing Rick Perry, who's the Texas Governor. They were in New Hampshire for a campaign event. Arpaio supports Perry because he believes Perry has done more on border security than other candidates. Arpaio mentions needing a tough president to fund border security from Brownsville to San Diego. He also refers to Perry's border security record as superior.

Perry responds, saying he's honored by the endorsement. He talks about the struggles border states face due to Washington's failures and mentions their shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He emphasizes that a secure border is vital for national security, public safety, and jobs.

The article also notes that Arpaio's endorsement might help Perry, who's been criticized by the Right for supporting DREAM children. There's been tension between Perry and Romney over immigration policies. Romney criticized Perry for a law allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates, calling it a magnet. Perry, however, supports work visas but opposes amnesty or citizenship paths. He plans to secure the border within a year with more boots on the ground, fencing, and aerial resources.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include who endorsed whom, the reasons given, the significance of the endorsement, and mention the criticism Perry has faced, especially from Romney. Also, highlight Perry's immigration stance and his border security plan.

Let me structure this: Start with Arpaio endorsing Perry, their positions on immigration, the reasons for endorsement, Perry's response, the potential benefit to Perry, the criticism from Romney, and Perry's stance on visas and border security.

I should make sure to keep it concise, hitting all key points without getting too detailed. Also, ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.
