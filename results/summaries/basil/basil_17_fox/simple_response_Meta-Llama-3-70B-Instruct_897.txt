SUMMARY:

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, has endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio praised Perry's border security record and plan, saying he will make the border and nation safer. Perry has faced criticism from the Right for his support of DREAM children and has clashed with Mitt Romney over immigration issues. Romney has accused Perry of creating a magnet for undocumented immigrants by supporting in-state tuition rates for illegal immigrants. Perry has proposed extending work visas to allow undocumented immigrants to move freely between the US and their home countries, but opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. Arpaio's endorsement could be helpful to Perry, as it validates his tough-on-crime stance and commitment to border security.

END OF SUMMARY.
