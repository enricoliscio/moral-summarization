SUMMARY: Arizona's self-styled "toughest sheriff," Joe Arpaio, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, citing Perry's strong record and plan for border security. Arpaio, known for his harsh stance on illegal immigration, praised Perry's commitment to combating illegal immigration and his support for increased border security operations. Perry has faced criticism from some conservatives for his stance on immigration, including his support for the DREAM Act and his opposition to building a border wall. However, Perry has also stressed his commitment to securing the border and increasing border security resources. The endorsement from Arpaio, a controversial but influential figure in the immigration debate, is seen as a boost to Perry's campaign and a validation of his tough-on-crime and border security credentials.

END OF SUMMARY.
