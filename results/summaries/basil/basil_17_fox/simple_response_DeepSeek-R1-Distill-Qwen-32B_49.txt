Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral angles.

First, the article talks about Joe Arpaio endorsing Rick Perry. Arpaio is known for his tough stance on immigration, which is a moral issue for him. He's proud of his border security measures, like chain gangs and supporting SB1070. That's a strong moral stance against illegal immigration.

Arpaio's endorsement is because he thinks Perry has the best record on border security. He mentions funding and full-time operations, which implies a commitment to protecting the nation. That's a moral argument about national security and safety.

Perry responds by agreeing and talking about the importance of a secure border for national security, public safety, and jobs. He also mentions his support for more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. This is Perry framing the issue as a matter of protecting American interests and jobs, which ties into economic and security morals.

The article also mentions criticism from Romney. Romney criticizes Perry for supporting in-state tuition for undocumented students, calling it a magnet for immigrants. This is a moral argument about fairness and the impact on American workers and the economy.

Perry counters by saying he supports work visas but opposes amnesty. He's trying to balance enforcement with practical solutions, which is a moral stance on handling immigration without rewarding illegal status.

I need to make sure the summary captures these moral framings: Arpaio's tough enforcement, Perry's commitment to security and jobs, Romney's criticism on fairness, and Perry's balanced approach. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure each point is clear.

Let me structure it: Start with Arpaio's endorsement and his reasons. Then mention Perry's response, highlighting his priorities. Then address Romney's criticism and Perry's counter. Finally, note the political implications of the endorsement.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details and focus on the moral arguments each side is making. Make sure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too wordy.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring each moral angle is represented.
