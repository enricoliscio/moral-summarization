SUMMARY: 
Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who calls himself "America's Toughest Sheriff," famously re-instituted chain gangs and has been a major supporter of Arizona's controversial SB1070 immigration law. He praised Perry for his tough-on-crime approach and his commitment to border security, stating that Perry has a superior record and plan to secure the border and make the nation safer. Arpaio's endorsement highlights Perry's dedication to fighting border crime and his shared goals of increasing personnel, border fencing, and surveillance. This endorsement comes as Perry faces criticism from the Right for his stance on immigration and clashes with Mitt Romney over the issue. Perry has been accused of providing magnets for undocumented immigrants, but he denies these claims and stresses his opposition to amnesty. Perry promises to secure the border within a year, demonstrating his commitment to protecting America's national security and public safety.
END OF SUMMARY.
