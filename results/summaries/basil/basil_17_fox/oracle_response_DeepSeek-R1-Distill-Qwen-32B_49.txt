Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, no more than 200 words, that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed Rick Perry for the Republican nomination. Arpaio is known for tough immigration stances, like chain gangs and supporting SB1070. He endorses Perry because of his border security record. Perry emphasizes the importance of border security, mentioning more personnel, fencing, and surveillance. He also talks about federal involvement and opposing amnesty. Romney criticizes Perry's policies, like in-state tuition for undocumented students and work visas. The article also mentions the clash between Perry and Romney on immigration issues.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list: immigration, reinstituted, combat, champion, fund, make, fail, fighting, crime, fencing, surveillance, protecting, attend, put, permitting, putting, fight, safer.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Start with Arpaio endorsing Perry, his tough stance on immigration. Mention the chain gangs and SB1070. Highlight that Perry has a better border security record. Include the specific measures like fencing and surveillance. Note Romney's criticism about the magnet effect and work visas. Conclude with Perry's commitment to securing the border and making the nation safer.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include the morally framed words without making it sound forced. Also, ensure the summary flows naturally and covers all main points.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the endorsement, mention Arpaio's background, then Perry's plan, Romney's criticism, and end with Perry's commitment. I'll check each sentence to include the necessary words.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration, endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination. Arpaio, who reinstituted chain gangs and supported Arizona's SB1070 immigration law, praised Perry for his border security record, stating Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration than other candidates. Arpaio emphasized the need for a president who champions and funds full-time border security, including fencing and surveillance. Perry, in turn, highlighted the importance of securing the border to protect national security, public safety, and jobs. The endorsement comes as Perry faces criticism from the right for supporting DREAM children and in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. Romney has criticized Perry for creating a "magnet" for undocumented immigrants in Texas. Perry, however, has proposed extending work visas while opposing amnesty, vowing to secure the border within a year by deploying more personnel, fencing, and aerial resources to make the nation safer. END OF SUMMARY.
