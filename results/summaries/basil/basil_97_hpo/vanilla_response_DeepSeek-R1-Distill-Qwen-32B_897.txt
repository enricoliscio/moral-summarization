Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by stating that the bill passed the House. It mentions the bill's goals: expanding voting access, public funding for elections, transparency in campaign finance, restoring ex-felon voting rights, ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. Pelosi and other reps are quoted about its significance.

Next, the article explains the bill's purpose in response to voter rights challenges and campaign funding inequality. It also notes the collaborative process by Democrats, including the task force led by Sarbanes. The bill was a top priority after the 2018 elections, with 100 candidates pushing for it.

Republicans oppose it, calling it a power grab and arguing against public funding and ethics laws. McConnell won't bring it to the Senate. Trump might veto it. Democrats plan to keep pushing the issues even if the bill doesn't pass.

I should include all these points concisely. Keep it under 200 words, focusing on the bill's passage, its main provisions, Democratic support, Republican opposition, and future plans. Make sure to mention key figures like Pelosi, Sarbanes, and McConnell.

The bill, opposed by Republicans, faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing not to bring it to the floor.
