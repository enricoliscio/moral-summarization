SUMMARY: On Friday, the Democrats' landmark bill, the For The People Act, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 234-193. The bill aims to expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, enhance transparency in campaign financing, restore voting rights to ex-felons, strengthen executive branch ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. The legislation is a result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms. It was the party's top priority upon winning control of the House in the 2018 elections. The bill was opposed by Republicans, who criticized it as a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. However, Democrats believe the reform package is popular and plan to continue pushing for individual pieces of it to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights in the spotlight.
