Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The For The People Act passed the House, focusing on campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reforms. It expands voting access, restores rights for ex-felons, and aims to reduce inequality. The bill is opposed by Republicans, who view it as a power grab. Democrats believe it's a step towards changing politics for the better.

Next, I'll identify the key morally framed words: expand, enhance, restore, strengthen, gerrymandering, attacks, stem, inequality, takes, gives, prioritize, clear, corruption, grab, assaulted, benefit, restrict, restrictions, overturned, veto, reauthorization, change.

I need to craft a concise summary using these words. I'll start by stating the bill's passage, then outline its main provisions using the appropriate terms. I'll mention the opposition and the Democrats' response, ensuring to include words like'restrict','veto', and'reauthorization'. Finally, I'll conclude with the impact the bill aims to have, using 'change' to emphasize the moral goal.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the bill's passage, its provisions, opposition, and future steps. This way, the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

SUMMARY:  
The For The People Act, a landmark bill prioritizing campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reforms, passed the House 234-193. It aims to expand voting access, enhance transparency in money in politics, restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. Democrats view it as a step to stem inequality and take power from elites, giving it to the people. Republicans opposed it, calling it a federal power grab and accusing it of assaulting free speech and benefiting lazy workers. The bill, driven by a clear mission to combat corruption, would overturn restrictive voter laws and prioritize reforms first endorsed by 100 Democratic candidates. Despite Senate opposition led by McConnell, Democrats plan to keep the issues front and center, with Schumer pushing for automatic voter registration and Udall outlining a Senate companion bill. The legislation faces a potential veto from Trump but is seen as a pivotal step toward changing politics and ensuring fairness. END OF SUMMARY.
