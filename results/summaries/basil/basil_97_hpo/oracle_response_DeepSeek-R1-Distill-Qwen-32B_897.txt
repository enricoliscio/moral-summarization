Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the For The People Act passing in the House, which includes voting rights, campaign finance reforms, and ethics laws. The Democrats are pushing this as a way to increase access, transparency, and fairness, countering Republican opposition.

The author uses words like "expand," "enhance," "restore," "strengthen," which are positive actions. They also use negative terms like "attacks," "inequality," "grab," "assaulted," "restrict," which show the opposition's stance. I need to include these words to maintain the moral tone.

I should structure the summary to highlight the bill's goals, the Democrats' priorities, and the Republican opposition. I'll mention the key points: expanding voting access, public funding for elections, ending gerrymandering, and combating corruption. Then, note the Republican criticisms and the future steps in the Senate.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start with the bill passing, outline its main provisions, then the opposition, and finally the next steps. Using the morally charged words will emphasize the stakes and the opposing viewpoints.

SUMMARY: The For The People Act, a landmark bill passed by the House, aims to expand voting access, enhance transparency in campaign finance, restore voting rights for ex-felons, and strengthen ethics laws. It prioritizes combating inequality and corruption by taking power from elites and giving it to the people. Republicans oppose the bill, calling it a federal power grab that assaults free speech and restricts voter access. Despite Senate opposition, Democrats plan to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights front and center, with efforts to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and mandate automatic voter registration. The bill, while just the first step, represents a pivotal moment in the fight to change politics and give power back to the American people. END OF SUMMARY.
