Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I should include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The For The People Act passed the House, expanding voting access, funding elections with public money, enhancing transparency, restoring ex-felons' voting rights, strengthening ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. Democrats see it as a fight against corruption and inequality, while Republicans oppose it as a power grab.

I should structure the summary to highlight the positive aspects from the Democrats' perspective using words like "expand," "enhance," "restore," "strengthens," "stem," "takes," "gives," "prioritize," "corruption," "restrict," "overturned," and "change." I also need to mention Republican opposition using terms like "attacks," "grab," "assaulted," and "restrictions."

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start with the bill passing, outline its key provisions, mention the moral arguments from both sides, and conclude with the Democrats' determination to push for change despite Republican opposition.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to make sure each point is covered without being too verbose. Also, include the key morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring all the moral terms are included and the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The For The People Act, a landmark bill passed by the House of Representatives, aims to expand voting access, enhance transparency in campaign finance, restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, and strengthen ethics laws. Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, view the bill as a pivotal step to stem inequality and corruption, taking power from elites and giving it to the American people. The legislation prioritizes reforms to combat attacks on voting rights and partisan gerrymandering, while Republicans oppose it as a federal power grab that assaults free speech and benefits lazy workers. The bill would overturn voter restrictions and empower small donors through public funding, but faces a veto from President Trump and no action in the Senate. Democrats remain committed to changing politics, with plans to keep corruption and voting rights front and center. END OF SUMMARY.
