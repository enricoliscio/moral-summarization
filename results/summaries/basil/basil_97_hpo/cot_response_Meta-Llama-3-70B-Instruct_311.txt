SUMMARY:
The House of Representatives has passed the landmark For The People Act, a historic and pivotal bill that aims to expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, and enhance transparency in politics. The bill takes power from the elites, special interests, and the 1 percent, and gives it to the American people. Democrats hailed the passage as a day that will make a difference, and a chance to be on the right side of history. The bill answers rising attacks on voting rights and stems the increasing inequality of campaign funding, empowering small donors with matching contributions from public funds. Republicans, however, castigated the bill as a federal power grab, assaulting free speech rights and benefiting lazy workers. Despite opposition, Democrats believe the reform package is popular and plan to keep pushing for change. END OF SUMMARY.
