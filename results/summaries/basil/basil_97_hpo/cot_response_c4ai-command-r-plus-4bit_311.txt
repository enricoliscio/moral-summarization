SUMMARY:
The Democrats' landmark campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reform bill, the For The People Act, passed the House of Representatives on Friday. The bill aims to answer rising attacks on voting rights and empower small donors by matching their contributions with public funds. It also seeks to restrict the influence of special interests and elites in politics and enhance the transparency of campaign funding. This was a top priority for Democrats upon winning control of the House in 2018, driven by party leaders and candidates who heard complaints about the endemic corruption of money in politics from constituents. The bill passed with mostly partisan support, as Republicans hardened their opposition, castigating it as a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections by increasing voting access. They also criticized the bill's assault on free speech and unnecessary ethics laws. Despite the bill facing opposition in the Senate and a potential veto from President Trump, Democrats believe the reforms are popular and plan to continue fighting for them, keeping the issues of corruption and voting rights at the forefront of the national agenda.
