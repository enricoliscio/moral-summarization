Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the For The People Act passing in the House. The author presents it as a significant step towards democracy and fairness, so I should highlight that. 

First, I'll note the key points: the bill passed 234-193, it's Democrats' top priority, and it includes expanding voting access, public funding for elections, transparency, restoring ex-felons' voting rights, ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. Pelosi and others are praising it as historic. 

Then, I should mention the Republican opposition, their arguments against it, and McConnell's stance in the Senate. Also, the Democrats' plan to keep pushing the issue even if it doesn't pass now. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the main elements. Make sure to maintain the moral perspective, emphasizing democracy, fairness, and the fight against special interests. 

Let me structure it: start with the bill passing, its main provisions, the Democrats' praise, Republican opposition, Senate's stance, and the future plans. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The For The People Act, a landmark bill aimed at expanding voting rights, increasing transparency in campaign finance, and reducing the influence of special interests, passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday with a 234-193 vote. The legislation, a top priority for Democrats since winning the House in 2018, includes provisions to expand voting access, create publicly funded elections, restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, and end partisan gerrymandering. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. John Lewis, praised the bill as a historic step toward democracy and fairness. Republicans opposed the bill, arguing it was a federal overreach and a power grab for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to block the bill in the Senate, while Democrats plan to keep the issue alive by voting on individual parts and pursuing related legislation. The bill represents a significant effort to address corruption and inequality in politics, with Democrats framing it as a fight for the American people against elites and special interests. END OF SUMMARY.
