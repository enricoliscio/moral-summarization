Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act passing the House. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that the Democrats passed a significant bill called the For The People Act in the House. It mentions that this was their top priority after winning control in 2018. The bill aims to expand voting access, provide public funding for elections, increase transparency in campaign finances, restore voting rights for ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end gerrymandering. Pelosi and other representatives are quoted, emphasizing the historic nature of the bill and its impact on reducing the influence of elites and special interests.

Then, the article talks about the collaborative process within the Democratic Party to get this bill passed, mentioning the Democracy Reform Task Force led by Rep. Sarbanes. It also notes that 100 candidates, including newly elected ones, pushed for these reforms, highlighting the issue of money in politics.

On the Republican side, there's opposition. They criticize the bill as a power grab, arguing it infringes on free speech and is unnecessary. McConnell won't bring it to the Senate, and Trump is advised to veto it if it comes to him. Democrats are planning to keep pushing the issues, possibly through individual votes and other bills.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key elements: the bill's passage, its main provisions, the Democratic priorities, Republican opposition, and the future steps.

I'll start by stating the bill's passage, its main goals, and the party's priorities. Then mention the collaborative effort and the candidates' push. Next, outline Republican opposition and McConnell's stance. Finally, note the Democrats' plans to continue advocating for these reforms.

Let me make sure I don't miss any crucial points. The bill's impact on voting rights, campaign finance, and ethics is important. Also, the quotes from Pelosi and Lofgren emphasize the significance. The Republican arguments against it, like power grab and free speech issues, are key points. And the Democrats' future steps, like separate bills, should be included.

I need to keep the summary concise but comprehensive. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point without getting too detailed. Let me put it all together now.
