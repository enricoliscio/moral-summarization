Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points. 

The article mentions that the House passed a landmark bill called the For The People Act. It was a top priority for Democrats after winning the House in 2018. The bill includes several major reforms: expanding voting access, public funding for elections, transparency in money politics, restoring voting rights for ex-felons, ethics laws for the executive branch, and ending gerrymandering. 

I should note the main supporters like Nancy Pelosi and Zoe Lofgren, who emphasized the significance of the bill. It's important to mention that the bill passed along party lines, with Republicans opposing it, arguing it's a power grab and infringing on free speech. 

The article also states that the Senate won't take up the bill, with McConnell opposing it, and Democrats planning to keep pushing the issues. 

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the bill's passage, its key provisions, the reaction from both parties, and the future steps. I should ensure it's clear and includes all essential details without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives passed the For The People Act, a landmark bill aimed at campaign finance reform, voting rights, and ethics. The bill, which passed 234-193, includes provisions to expand voting access, establish publicly funded elections, increase transparency in political financing, restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, view the legislation as a historic step to empower small donors and reduce the influence of special interests. Republicans opposed the bill, arguing it constitutes a federal power grab and infringes on free speech. The Senate is unlikely to take up the bill, as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposes campaign finance reforms. Democrats plan to keep the issues of voting rights and corruption central in their agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
