SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the landmark For The People Act, a bill that aims to expand voting access, enhance transparency in politics, and restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons. The bill seeks to strengthen executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding. Democrats believe the bill "takes power from the elites, special interests, and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people." The passage of the bill is the result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms. Republicans, however, are in hardened opposition, casting the bill as a federal power grab that assaults free speech rights and provides unnecessary benefits. Despite this, Democrats plan to continue pushing for reforms, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling for automatic voter registration across the country. The fight for corruption-free politics will not end until Democrats win it, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

END OF SUMMARY.
