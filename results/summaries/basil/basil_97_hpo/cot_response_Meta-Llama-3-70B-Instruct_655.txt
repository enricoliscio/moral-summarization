SUMMARY:
The House of Representatives has passed the landmark For The People Act, a historic and pivotal bill that aims to take power from the elites and special interests and give it to the American people. The bill dramatically expands voting access, creates publicly funded House elections, and enhances transparency in politics, thereby addressing the rising attacks on voting rights and the increasing inequality of campaign funding. Democrats believe this is a moral imperative, with Rep. John Lewis saying "this vote is an opportunity to be on the right side of history." Republicans, however, are in hardened opposition, claiming the bill is a federal power grab that assaults free speech rights. Despite this, Democrats plan to keep pushing for reforms, with Sen. Tom Udall announcing a Senate companion bill. This is just the first step in the fight to change politics and end corruption. END OF SUMMARY.
