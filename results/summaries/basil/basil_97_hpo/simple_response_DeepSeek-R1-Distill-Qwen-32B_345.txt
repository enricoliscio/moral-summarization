Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act. The user wants a concise summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Democrats passing a major bill in the House, called the For The People Act. It covers campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reforms. The bill aims to expand voting access, provide public funding for elections, increase transparency, restore voting rights for ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end gerrymandering. Pelosi and other reps are praising it as a historic step against elites and special interests. Republicans oppose it, calling it a power grab and arguing it infringes on free speech and is unnecessary. The Senate isn't taking it up, but Dems are pushing for individual pieces and other reforms.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral aspects, like fighting against elites and empowering the people. Also, include the opposition's viewpoint to show the debate. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives passed the For The People Act, a landmark bill aimed at expanding voting access, reducing the influence of money in politics, and curbing gerrymandering. The legislation, which passed along party lines, would restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, create publicly funded elections, and enhance transparency in campaign financing. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, framed the bill as a historic step to empower the American people by taking power away from elites and special interests. Republicans opposed the bill, calling it a federal overreach that infringes on free speech and unnecessary. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is unlikely to take up the bill, but Democrats plan to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights prominent. The bill represents a significant effort to address systemic inequities in the political system, with Democrats emphasizing its moral imperative to ensure fair representation and combat voter suppression. END OF SUMMARY.
