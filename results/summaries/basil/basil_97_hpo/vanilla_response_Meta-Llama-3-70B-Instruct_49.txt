SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the For The People Act, a landmark bill aimed at reforming campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics. The bill, which passed 234-193, is a top priority for Democrats and seeks to expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, and increase transparency in politics. It would also restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons, strengthen executive branch ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. Republicans opposed the bill, arguing it was a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, but Democrats plan to continue pushing for reforms, including reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and mandating automatic voter registration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the passage a "historic day" that will "make a difference" in the fight against corruption and for voting rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
