SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the landmark For The People Act, a bill that aims to expand voting access, enhance transparency in politics, restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons, and strengthen executive branch ethics laws. The bill is a historic step towards combating attacks on voting rights and stemming the increasing inequality of campaign funding. It takes power from the elites and gives it to the American people, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren. The passage of the bill is the result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms. Republicans, however, have castigated the bill as a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections, assaulting free speech rights and providing unnecessary benefits. Despite this opposition, Democrats believe the reform package is popular and plan to continue pushing for change. As Rep. John Lewis said, "If not us, then who? If not now, then when?" END OF SUMMARY.
