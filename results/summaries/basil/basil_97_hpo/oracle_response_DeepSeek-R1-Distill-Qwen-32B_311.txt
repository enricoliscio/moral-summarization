Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I have to make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, no more than 200 words, and should end with the specified tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The For The People Act was passed by the House, it's a big deal for Democrats, and it includes several reforms like expanding voting access, public funding for elections, transparency in campaign finance, restoring voting rights for ex-felons, strengthening ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. Republicans are against it, seeing it as a power grab and a threat to free speech. The bill aims to address attacks on voting rights and stem inequality. The author uses words like "expand," "enhance," "restore," "strengthen," "attacks," "stem," "inequality," "takes," "gives," etc.

I need to structure the summary to include these words. I'll start by stating the bill's passage, then outline its key provisions using the moral terms. I should mention the Democratic priorities, the opposition from Republicans, and the future steps like the Senate companion bill and the plan to keep the issues relevant.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the bill's goals, the party's efforts, Republican opposition, and the next steps. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points with the moral framing words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count and adjust if needed to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The For The People Act, a landmark bill passed by the House, aims to expand voting access, enhance campaign finance transparency, restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, and strengthen ethics laws. It also seeks to end partisan gerrymandering and stem the inequality of campaign funding by empowering small donors through public matching contributions. Democrats, prioritizing this legislation, view it as a way to take power from elites and give it to the American people, countering rising attacks on voting rights. Republicans oppose the bill, calling it a federal power grab that assaults free speech and benefits lazy workers. The Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, is unlikely to pass the bill, but Democrats plan to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights front and center. The bill, seen as a pivotal step toward changing politics, faces potential veto by President Trump but remains a key focus for Democrats in their mission to overturn voter restrictions and reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. END OF SUMMARY.
