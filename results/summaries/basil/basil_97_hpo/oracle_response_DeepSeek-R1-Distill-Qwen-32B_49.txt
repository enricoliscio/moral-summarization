Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words they listed. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the For The People Act passing in the House. It mentions expanding voting access, creating publicly funded elections, enhancing transparency, restoring voting rights for ex-felons, strengthening ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. These are all positive actions, so the moral framing is positive here.

The author uses words like "expand," "enhance," "restore," "strengthen," which are positive verbs. The bill is seen as a way to take power from elites and give it to the people, which is a significant moral statement. The opposition from Republicans is described as a "power grab" and "assault on free speech," which are negative moral framings.

I need to include these words in the summary. Also, the article mentions the collaborative process within the Democratic Party and the opposition from Republicans, including McConnell's stance. The bill's goals are to address attacks on voting rights and stem inequality, which are framed as necessary actions.

I should structure the summary to highlight the positive aspects of the bill, using the moral words, and then mention the opposition. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I'll start with the passage of the bill, its key provisions, the positive impact, and then touch on Republican opposition and future plans.

Let me draft this, making sure to include all the key morally framed words without making it too lengthy. I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the bill's passage, its goals, the process behind it, Republican opposition, and the Democrats' plans moving forward.

SUMMARY: The For The People Act, a landmark bill prioritizing voting rights, campaign finance reform, and ethics, passed the House 234-193. It aims to expand voting access, enhance political transparency, restore voting rights to ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end gerrymandering. Democrats framed the bill as a way to take power from elites and give it to the people, countering attacks on voting rights and stemming inequality. The legislation, driven by a collaborative effort within the Democratic Party, includes provisions like publicly funded elections and nonpartisan redistricting. Republicans opposed the bill, calling it a federal power grab that assaults free speech and benefits Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to block it, while Democrats plan to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights central. The bill represents a first step in changing politics, with Democrats vowing to continue the fight until victory. END OF SUMMARY.
