Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Democrats passing a major bill in the House called the For The People Act. It covers campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reforms. Key features include expanding voting access, public funding for elections, transparency in money politics, restoring ex-felon voting rights, ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. Pelosi and other reps are praising it as historic and a shift of power from elites to the people.

Republicans oppose it, calling it a power grab and arguing it infringes on free speech and is unnecessary. The Senate won't take it up, with McConnell being a big opponent. Democrats are planning to keep pushing these issues, maybe through separate bills or parts of the act.

I need to capture the moral aspects: Democrats are fighting for fairness, equality, and against corruption, while Republicans are against it, seeing it as a threat to their power or as overreach. The summary should highlight these opposing moral viewpoints.

I should structure the summary to first state the passage of the bill, its key provisions, the Democrats' positive stance, the Republican opposition, and the future plans. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's clear and concise while maintaining the moral framing.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the bill passing, mention the main provisions, then the Democratic perspective, followed by Republican opposition, and conclude with the future steps. Make sure to include quotes or paraphrases that emphasize the moral aspects, like giving power to the people vs. federal overreach.

I should also mention that the Senate isn't taking it up and that Democrats plan to keep pushing the issues. Maybe end with Pelosi's statement about changing politics.

Let me check the word count as I go to stay within limits. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically from introduction to conclusion, highlighting the moral framing throughout.

SUMMARY: The For The People Act, a landmark bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, aims to overhaul campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reforms. The bill, which passed 234-193, includes provisions to expand voting access, establish publicly funded elections, enhance transparency in political financing, restore voting rights for millions of ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, view the legislation as a historic shift of power from elites and special interests to the American people. Republicans, however, oppose the bill, labeling it a federal overreach that infringes on free speech and benefits Democrats. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has rejected the bill, but Democrats plan to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights prominent, possibly through separate legislation. The bill represents a significant step in Democrats' efforts to address inequality and restore faith in democracy, despite Republican opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
