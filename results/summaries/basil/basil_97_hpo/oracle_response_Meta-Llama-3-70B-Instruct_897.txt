SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the landmark For The People Act, a bill that aims to expand voting access, enhance transparency in politics, and restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons. The bill also seeks to strengthen executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding. Democrats believe the bill "takes power from the elites, special interests and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people." The passage of the bill is a historic moment, marking a pivotal day that will make a difference. Republicans, however, have castigated the bill as a federal power grab, assaulting free speech rights and benefiting "lazy workers." Despite the opposition, Democrats plan to continue pushing for reforms, including a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and automatic voter registration. The fight against corruption and for voting rights will not end until Democrats win. END OF SUMMARY.
