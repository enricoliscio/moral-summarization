SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed the For The People Act, a landmark bill that aims to expand voting access, increase transparency in campaign finance, and strengthen executive branch ethics laws. The bill, a top priority for Democrats, seeks to counter rising attacks on voting rights and stem the growing inequality of campaign funding. By empowering small donors and restoring voting rights to millions of ex-felons, the bill "takes power from the elites, special interests and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people." Republicans opposed the bill, claiming it's a federal power grab that assaults free speech rights. Despite this, Democrats believe the reform package is popular and plan to continue pushing for its passage in the Senate. As Rep. John Lewis said, "This vote is an opportunity to be on the right side of history. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?"
