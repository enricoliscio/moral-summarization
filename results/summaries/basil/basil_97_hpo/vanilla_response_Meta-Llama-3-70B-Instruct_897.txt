SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has passed the "For The People Act", a landmark bill aimed at reforming campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics. The bill, a top priority for Democrats, aims to expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, and increase transparency in political funding. It also seeks to restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons, strengthen executive branch ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. The bill passed with a 234-193 vote, largely along party lines, with Republicans opposing it as a "federal power grab". The bill is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate, but Democrats plan to continue pushing for reforms, including a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and automatic voter registration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed the passage as a "historic day" that will "make a difference" in the fight against corruption and for voting rights.
