Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that the Democrats passed a significant bill in the House, called the For The People Act. It was their top priority after winning the House in 2018. The bill includes several major components: expanding voting access, creating publicly funded elections, increasing transparency in campaign finances, restoring voting rights for ex-felons, strengthening ethics laws, and ending gerrymandering. Pelosi and other representatives are quoted, emphasizing the historic nature of the bill and its aim to reduce the influence of elites and special interests.

The article also talks about the process behind the bill, mentioning the Democracy Reform Task Force led by Rep. John Sarbanes. They worked on this even before the 2018 elections, and many candidates campaigned on these issues. The bill passed along party lines, with Republicans opposing it, arguing it's a power grab and infringing on free speech. McConnell won't bring it to the Senate, but Udall is working on a companion bill. Trump is expected to veto it if it reaches him. Democrats plan to keep pushing these issues, possibly through other bills like reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the bill's passage, its key provisions, the significance according to Democrats, Republican opposition, and the future steps.

I should start with the bill's passage, mention the main reforms, the Democratic perspective, Republican opposition, and the outlook in the Senate and beyond. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it:

1. Bill passed in the House with details.
2. Key provisions of the bill.
3. Democratic leaders' statements on its importance.
4. Republican opposition and their arguments.
5. Senate's stance and future plans by Democrats.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally.
