Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the For The People Act. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the author. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points. The bill passed the House, it's about campaign finance, voting rights, and ethics reforms. Democrats see it as a big deal, aiming to give power back to the people, countering attacks on voting rights and money in politics. Republicans oppose it, calling it a power grab and attacking it on free speech grounds. The Senate isn't taking it up, but Democrats plan to keep pushing.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral aspects. The Democrats are framing it as a fight for equality and against corruption, while Republicans are against it, possibly for partisan reasons. I should include the main points: what the bill does, who supports it and why, who opposes it and why, and the implications. Also, mention the process behind it and future steps. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clearâ€”like empowering the people vs. special interests.

Let me structure it: start with the bill passing, its goals, Democrats' stance, Republican opposition, Senate's stance, and future plans. Make sure to include the quotes that emphasize the moral aspect, like taking power from elites. Also, note that Republicans see it as a Democratic power grab. Keep each sentence focused and avoid unnecessary details. Ensure the summary flows logically from introduction to the bill, through its implications, to the current and future actions.

SUMMARY:  
The For The People Act, a landmark bill passed by the House, aims to expand voting access, reduce the influence of money in politics, and combat gerrymandering. Democrats view it as a historic step to empower ordinary Americans by curbing special interest influence and increasing transparency. The bill, which passed along party lines, would restore voting rights to ex-felons, fund elections with public money, and strengthen ethics laws. Republicans oppose it, calling it a federal power grab that infringes on free speech and benefits Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has dismissed the bill, but Democrats plan to keep it in the spotlight, pursuing related legislation. The bill reflects a moral commitment to democracy and equality, with Democrats framing it as a fight against corruption and inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
