SUMMARY: 
The House of Representatives passed the For The People Act, a landmark campaign finance, voting rights and ethics reform bill. The bill aims to answer rising attacks on voting rights and stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding by empowering small donors. It would dramatically expand voting access, restore voting rights to ex-felons, strengthen ethics laws, and end partisan gerrymandering. The bill is a priority for Democrats, who see it as a way to take power from elites and special interests and give it back to the American people. While the bill passed the House with Democratic support, it faces opposition from Republicans who view it as a federal power grab and assault on free speech rights. The bill is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate, but Democrats plan to continue pushing for similar reforms to fight corruption and protect voting rights. This includes reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and mandating automatic voter registration. The fight for these moral and just reforms will not end until they are victorious.
END OF SUMMARY.
