Okay, I need to tackle this query where the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided a news article about the For The People Act passing in the House. They want me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary using those terms. 

Starting with Step 1, I need to find all the single words in the article that carry a moral connotation. I'll go through the text and look for words that express values, ethics, or judgments. Words like "landmark," "priority," "expand," "transparency," "restore," "inequality," "power," "corruption," "opportunity," "history," "collaborative," "endemic," "corruption," "opposition," "power grab," "assault," "unnecessary," "restrict," "opponent," "reforms," "advise," "popular," "change," "fight," and "win." These words seem to carry moral weight as they relate to justice, fairness, and political integrity.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, incorporating as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should highlight the bill's goals, the Democratic support, Republican opposition, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to mention how the bill aims to reduce inequality, increase transparency, and empower the people, while noting the Republican counterarguments about overreach and free speech. Also, I'll include the political implications, such as McConnell's opposition and the Democrats' plans to keep the issues prominent.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing without being too verbose. I'll start by stating the bill's passage, its main provisions, the support from Democrats, the opposition from Republicans, and the future steps. I'll end with Pelosi's quote to emphasize the ongoing fight for political change.

I should also keep the language clear and concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details. Double-checking the word count to stay within 200 words is important. 

Finally, I'll structure the summary with the identified moral terms, ensuring that each key point is covered succinctly. This approach should meet the user's requirements effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
The For The People Act, a landmark bill prioritizing voting rights, campaign finance reform, and ethics, passed the House with strong Democratic support. The legislation aims to expand voting access, increase transparency in politics, restore voting rights to ex-felons, and reduce inequality by empowering small donors through public funding. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. John Lewis, framed the bill as a historic opportunity to shift power from elites and special interests to the American people. However, Republicans opposed the bill, labeling it a federal power grab that threatens free speech and unnecessarily restricts workers. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a vocal opponent of such reforms, will not take up the bill. Despite this, Democrats remain committed to advancing the legislation, with plans to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights at the forefront. Pelosi emphasized that the fight for political change will continue until victory. END OF SUMMARY.
