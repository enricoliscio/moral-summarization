SUMMARY:
Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas is facing resistance from his son, Seth Hutchinson, over a religious freedom bill that critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, wrote to his father warning that the proposal could damage Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their political differences, the two have a close and loving relationship. Seth's views began to diverge from his family's conservative values when he was 15, after witnessing financial hardships faced by older workers in low-paying jobs. He became interested in gay rights around the same time, inspired by friends' stories and an art teacher's arrest. The governor has announced plans to revise the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. END OF SUMMARY.
