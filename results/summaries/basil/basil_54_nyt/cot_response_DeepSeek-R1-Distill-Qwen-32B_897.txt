Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. The user mentioned that these are single words, so I'll go through the text and pick out any terms that carry a moral connotation. Words like "resistance," "justice," "discrimination," "damage," "frustrated," "harsh," "wrong," "arrested," "oppression," "values," "activist," "pressure," and "rethinking" come to mind. These words reflect the ethical dimensions of the story.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes these moral terms. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the conflict between Asa and Seth Hutchinson over the religious freedom bill, Seth's concerns about discrimination and economic impact, their differing political views, Seth's background leading to his activism, and the ongoing dialogue between father and son despite their disagreements.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the identified moral words without making it sound forced. It's important to highlight the family's political differences and Seth's role in advocating for justice and equality, as well as the governor's consideration of rewriting the bill due to external pressure.

I'll start by introducing the main conflict, then delve into Seth's background and his stance on the bill. I'll mention the impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy, his work in labor activism, and the ongoing communication between the father and son. Finally, I'll note the governor's decision to reconsider the bill, emphasizing the external pressure rather than Seth's influence.

Throughout, I'll make sure to keep the language clear and concise, preserving the moral framing by using the identified words appropriately. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and ethical implications.

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faced resistance from his son, Seth, over a religious freedom bill critics claim legalizes discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas’s reputation and economy. Their politically complex relationship reflects differing views: Asa, a Republican, and Seth, a Democrat and labor organizer. Seth grew concerned with justice and gay rights during high school, influenced by witnessing financial hardships and the arrest of a closeted gay teacher. Despite disagreements, they maintain a close relationship, with Seth emphasizing that his father’s reconsideration of the bill was due to external pressure, not his influence. The governor later agreed to recall or rewrite parts of the bill. END OF SUMMARY.
