Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and his son Seth. The governor is considering a religious freedom bill that critics say allows discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson, who's a labor organizer in Texas, has been critical of the bill. The article talks about their relationship, how Seth has differing political views from his father, and how he's been vocal about his concerns, even writing to his father about it. 

The moral framing here seems to be about family dynamics, political disagreement, and the tension between tradition and progressive values. The author presents Seth as someone who's always been concerned with justice, which is a positive moral trait. There's also the aspect of the bill's potential impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy, which adds a moral dimension of responsibility and consequences.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the governor's bill, Seth's opposition, their relationship, Seth's background and how his views evolved, and the implications of the bill. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral elements like justice, family, and the consequences of the legislation.

I'll start by introducing the governor and the bill, then mention Seth's opposition. I'll include how Seth's views developed, his work with labor and gay rights, and the family's communication despite differing views. I'll end with the governor's consideration to revise the bill, but note that Seth doesn't take credit for that change.

Let me structure it step by step to ensure all important points are included without going over the word limit. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like Seth's concern for justice and the potential negative impact of the bill on Arkansas.
