SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, the two have a close relationship, with Seth saying "I love my dad... we disagree a lot on political issues." Seth's views began to diverge from his family's conservative values as a teenager, when he saw older workers struggling financially and became interested in gay rights. He has since become a labor activist in Texas. The governor has announced plans to revise the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. The story highlights the importance of family relationships and open communication, even in the face of political disagreements. It also underscores the significance of standing up for what is right, even if it means disagreeing with those closest to us.
