SUMMARY: Seth Hutchinson, the son of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, has publicly disagreed with his father over a controversial "religious freedom" bill, arguing that it would legalize discrimination against gay people and damage the state's reputation and economy. Despite their differing political views, the father and son have a close relationship, and Seth has a history of advocating for justice and gay rights. He traces the origins of his political awakening to his teenage years when he worked low-paying jobs and witnessed the financial hardships faced by older workers. He also recalls an incident involving the arrest of a gay art teacher who was not out, which sparked his interest in gay rights. While Seth has not swayed his father's decision to reconsider the bill, he believes it is due to pressure from various sides. The governor has requested that lawmakers recall or rewrite portions of the bill.
