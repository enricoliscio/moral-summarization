SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom" bill, which critics say would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, the two have a close relationship. Seth, 31, is an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union and has been involved in labor activism. He grew up on the campaign trail, but his views began to shift when he worked low-paying jobs and saw friends struggle with their sexual orientations. Seth has been vocal about his opposition to the bill, warning his father that it could harm Arkansas' reputation and economy. The governor has since announced plans to revise or recall parts of the bill, but Seth denies taking credit for swaying his father's decision. The two communicate regularly and engage in lively conversations about politics.
