SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom" bill, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their differing political views, the two have a close relationship. Seth, 31, is an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union and has been involved in labor activism. He grew up on the campaign trail and initially shared his family's conservative values, but his views shifted as he worked low-paying jobs and saw friends struggling with their sexual orientations. Seth has robustly debated his father on political issues, including gay rights, since high school. The governor has announced plans to revise the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to external pressure. The two communicate regularly and gather with the family at least twice a year, engaging in lively conversations.
