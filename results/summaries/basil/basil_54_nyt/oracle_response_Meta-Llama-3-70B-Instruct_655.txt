SUMMARY:

Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against the religious freedom bill pending in Arkansas, warning that it could lead to discrimination against gay people and damage the state's reputation and economy. This is not surprising to those who know the Hutchinsons, as Seth has always been concerned with justice and has disagreed with his father on political issues. Despite their differences, the two have a close and loving relationship. Seth's views began to diverge from his family's when he worked low-paying jobs and saw older workers struggling financially. He also became interested in gay rights after friends discussed their sexual orientations and an art teacher was arrested for loitering. Seth has rallied for gay rights and has joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists. The governor has announced that he will ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, saying his father is rethinking the bill due to pressure from all sides.
