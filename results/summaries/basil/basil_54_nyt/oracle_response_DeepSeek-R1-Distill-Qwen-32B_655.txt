Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Governor Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, who has differing political views, especially regarding a religious freedom bill in Arkansas. The author used specific morally charged words like justice, discrimination, reputation, economy, love, arrest, loiter, joined, rallied, ask, recall, rewrite, and credit. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Asa Hutchinson is the governor, and Seth is his son who disagrees with him on political issues, particularly the religious freedom bill. Seth thinks the bill could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. The bill is seen by critics as legalizing discrimination against gay people. The article also talks about Seth's background, how his views changed over time, and his current role as a labor activist in Texas. Despite their political differences, their family relationship remains strong.

I need to capture the moral elements here. The son's concern for justice and his opposition to discrimination are key. The potential impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy are moral considerations. The arrest of the art teacher highlights discrimination against gays. Seth's actions, like joining groups and rallying for gay rights, show his commitment to justice. The governor's decision to recall or rewrite the bill is influenced by various pressures, including Seth's input, but Seth doesn't take full credit.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with the governor and his son's disagreement on the bill. Mention the moral implications like discrimination, reputation, and economy. Include Seth's background and how his views evolved, highlighting his commitment to justice. Note their ongoing communication despite political differences. End with the governor's decision and Seth's modesty about his influence.

I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of the listed moral words as possible. Let me make sure each of those words is appropriately included without forcing them in unnaturally.
