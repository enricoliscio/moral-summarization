SUMMARY:

Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas is facing resistance from his son, Seth Hutchinson, over a religious freedom bill that critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, wrote to his father warning that the proposal could damage Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their political differences, the two maintain a close relationship, with Seth saying "I love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship." Seth's views on justice and discrimination began to take shape during his teenage years, as he worked low-paying jobs and saw friends struggling with financial hardships. He became interested in gay rights after witnessing the arrest of a gay art teacher who was not out due to fear of losing his job. The governor has announced plans to ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change of heart to pressure from all sides.
