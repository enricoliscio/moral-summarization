SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, wrote to his father warning that the bill could damage Arkansas's reputation and economy. This is not the first time Seth has disagreed with his father on political issues, but their close relationship remains intact. Seth's views began to diverge from his family's when he was 15, working low-paying jobs and seeing older workers struggle financially. He became interested in gay rights after friends discussed their sexual orientations and an art teacher was arrested for "loitering" in a park. Seth has always been concerned with justice, and his father's rethinking of the bill is likely due to pressure from all sides, not just his son's influence. The governor has since announced plans to ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
