SUMMARY:

In Arkansas, Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, wrote to his father warning that the bill could damage Arkansas's reputation and economy. This is not the first time the two have disagreed on political issues, despite their close relationship. Seth's views began to diverge from his family's when he was 15, working low-paying jobs and seeing older workers struggle financially. He became interested in gay rights after friends shared their sexual orientations and an art teacher was arrested for "attempting to loiter" in a park. Seth's father, the governor, has announced plans to ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. Despite their differences, the family remains close, with Seth emphasizing the importance of love and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
