Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Governor Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Governor Hutchinson, a Republican from Arkansas, talked about the religious freedom bill. He mentioned that his son Seth had opposed it. I remember that the religious freedom bill is often controversial, especially regarding discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.

Then, it talks about the Hutchinson family being influential in Arkansas. A friend of Seth, Shawn Standefer, says that Seth has always been concerned with justice. That gives some background on Seth's character.

On Saturday, as lawmakers were about to vote on the bill, Seth wrote to his father, warning that the bill could hurt Arkansas's reputation and economy. This shows Seth's active role in opposing the bill.

The article then goes into the complicated political relationship between Asa and Seth. Asa is a former congressman, and Seth is a labor organizer in Texas. They have a close relationship but disagree politically. Seth mentions that they stay close despite their disagreements.

Seth's political views started changing when he was around 15, working low-paying jobs and noticing financial hardships among older workers. He became interested in gay rights around the same time, influenced by friends and an arrest of a gay teacher. This shows his shift from following his parents' values to developing his own political stance.

The article also mentions that Seth had political discussions with his father even in high school. Now, they communicate regularly, with the family gathering a few times a year. Seth downplays his influence on his father's decision to reconsider the bill, attributing it to external pressure.

So, the key points to include in the summary are:

1. Governor Hutchinson mentioned his son Seth's opposition to the religious freedom bill.
2. Seth has always been concerned with justice and became politically active.
3. Seth warned his father about the bill's potential negative impact on Arkansas.
4. Their relationship is close despite political differences.
5. Seth's views evolved from his family's to his own, influenced by personal experiences.
6. Seth downplays his influence on his father's reconsideration of the bill.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures these points clearly. I'll structure it by introducing the conflict, Seth's background, his role in the situation, their relationship, and the outcome.
