SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", warning that it could lead to discrimination against gay people and damage the state's reputation and economy. Seth, a 31-year-old labor activist, has a long history of advocating for justice and gay rights, which has led to disagreements with his father on political issues. Despite their differences, the two maintain a close and loving relationship. Seth's views began to shift at 15, when he saw older workers struggling financially in low-paying jobs, and later became interested in gay rights after a teacher was arrested for "loitering" in a park. The governor has announced plans to ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. The two continue to communicate regularly and engage in lively conversations.
