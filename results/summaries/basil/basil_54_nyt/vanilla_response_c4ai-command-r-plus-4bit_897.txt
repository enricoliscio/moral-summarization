SUMMARY: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson disclosed that his son, Seth Hutchinson, had voiced opposition to a "religious freedom" bill pending in the state, highlighting their politically complicated relationship. Seth, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, has long held differing political views from his father, a Republican. Despite growing up in a political family and initially embracing their values, Seth's views shifted during his teenage years as he encountered social and economic injustices. He became an advocate for gay rights and joined organizations like the Young Democratic Socialists. While their views diverge, father and son maintain a close relationship, regularly communicating and gathering as a family. In the wake of widespread criticism, Governor Hutchinson has reconsidered his stance on the bill, but Seth remains humble, attributing his father's change of heart to pressure from various sources.
