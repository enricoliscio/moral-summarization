Alright, I need to summarize this article about Governor Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth. The article talks about their political differences, especially regarding the religious freedom bill in Arkansas. 

First, I should identify the main points. The governor is considering the bill, but his son Seth opposes it. Seth's opposition isn't a surprise to their friends because he's always been concerned with justice. The bill is controversial because critics say it allows discrimination against gays. Seth wrote to his father about the potential harm to Arkansas's reputation and economy.

I should mention their relationship: they have a close bond despite political disagreements. Seth used to follow his parents' values but his views changed in high school when he worked various jobs and became aware of social issues, including gay rights. 

Also, Seth's background includes being a labor activist in Texas and his involvement in political groups. The governor is considering changes to the bill, but Seth doesn't take credit for it, attributing it to external pressure.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements: their relationship, Seth's opposition to the bill, his reasons, their differing political views, and the impact on the bill. I should present this clearly and concisely, making sure to highlight the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas revealed that his son, Seth, opposes the state's religious freedom bill, which critics say could legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson, a labor activist, has long held progressive views, differing from his father's conservative stance. Their relationship remains close despite political disagreements. Seth's concerns about the bill's impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy were shared with his father, though he downplays his influence on the governor's decision to reconsider the legislation. Seth's political evolution began in high school, driven by experiences working low-wage jobs and growing awareness of social justice issues, including gay rights. The family maintains a close bond, with regular communication and annual gatherings. Seth credits external pressure, not his input, for the governor's reevaluation of the bill.
