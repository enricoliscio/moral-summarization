Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral aspects.

The article is about Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and his son Seth, who is opposing the religious freedom bill. The bill is controversial because critics say it would allow discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson, who works as a labor organizer in Texas, wrote to his father to warn that the bill could hurt Arkansas's reputation and economy. 

The author highlights the moral conflict between father and son, showing Seth's concern for justice and his evolving political views. There's a focus on how Seth's experiences, like working low-paying jobs and being involved in gay rights, shaped his beliefs. The article also mentions their close relationship despite political disagreements, emphasizing family support and open dialogue.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral tension and the personal growth of Seth Hutchinson. I should include key points: the bill's opposition, Seth's role, their relationship, and the underlying values like justice and family support.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with the main conflict, mention Seth's stance, his background, their relationship, and the outcome where the governor reconsiders the bill, but Seth downplays his influence.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, ending with the specified tokens. Let me draft that.
