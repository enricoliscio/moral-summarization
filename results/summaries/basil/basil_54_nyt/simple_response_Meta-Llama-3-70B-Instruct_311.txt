SUMMARY:

In a heartening display of moral courage, Seth Hutchinson, son of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom" bill, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their close relationship, Seth, a labor activist, has taken a strong stance against the bill, warning his father that it could damage the state's reputation and economy. This is not a new development, as Seth has been concerned with justice and has disagreed with his father on political issues for some time. His views began to diverge from his family's conservative values during his teenage years, as he worked low-paying jobs and saw the struggles of older workers. He also became interested in gay rights after seeing the unfair treatment of a gay art teacher. Seth's actions demonstrate the importance of standing up for what is right, even if it means disagreeing with those closest to us.
