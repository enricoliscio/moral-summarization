Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Gov. Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, who disagree on a religious freedom bill in Arkansas. The son thinks the bill could legalize discrimination against gay people, which affects the state's reputation and economy. The author uses words like justice, discrimination, reputation, economy, love, arrest, loiter, joined, rallied, ask, recall, rewrite, credit.

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll outline the key points: the governor's son opposes the bill, the family's influence, Seth's background, his shift in views, their relationship, and the impact on the bill.

I'll make sure to include the moral terms like justice, discrimination, reputation, economy, and love. I'll also mention Seth's actions like joining groups and rallying for gay rights.

I should structure it to show the father-son dynamic and the political differences. Also, note that Seth doesn't take credit for the governor's decision, emphasizing it's due to broader pressure.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary moral terms. I'll check to make sure the flow is logical and all key points are covered without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faced criticism from his son, Seth, over a religious freedom bill that critics argue could legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. While the Hutchinsons have a close relationship, Seth has long held differing political views, shaped by his experiences working low-wage jobs and advocating for justice, including gay rights. Seth, who joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists and rallied for equality during Gov. Mike Huckabee's tenure, has always defended his beliefs, even as they diverged from his father's. Despite Seth's concerns, the governor ultimately decided to ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, though Seth downplayed his influence, attributing the change to broader pressure. Their politically complex yet loving relationship remains intact, with regular communication and family gatherings. END OF SUMMARY.
