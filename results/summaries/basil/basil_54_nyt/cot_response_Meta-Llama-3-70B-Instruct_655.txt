SUMMARY:
Gov. Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against the religious freedom bill in Arkansas, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, the two have a close and loving relationship. Seth, a labor activist, has been concerned with justice and has always spoken his mind, even as a high school student. His views began to shift when he saw older workers struggling financially and friends discussing their sexual orientations. He grew frustrated with the injustices and became interested in gay rights. The governor has announced plans to revise the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. The father-son duo has a robust and engaging dynamic, with lively conversations despite their disagreements. END OF SUMMARY.
