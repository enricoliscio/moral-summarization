SUMMARY: In a complicated political relationship, the son of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson publicly opposed a so-called "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson, 31, has long held different political views from his father, a Republican, and has been an advocate for justice and gay rights since his teenage years. He warned his father that the bill could damage Arkansas' reputation and economy, and negatively impact families. The younger Mr. Hutchinson's political consciousness was shaped by his early work experiences, where he witnessed the financial hardships of older workers in low-paying jobs. He also became sensitive to gay rights issues after the arrest of a gay teacher who was forced to remain closeted to keep his job. Despite their differing views, father and son maintain a close and respectful relationship, communicating regularly and gathering with the family often. Governor Hutchinson has indicated that he will ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth Hutchinson gives the credit to the collective pressure from various sides.
END OF SUMMARY.
