Okay, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task involves two steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words in the given news article, and then summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

Starting with step one, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "resistance," "justice," "discrimination," "damage," "values," "frustrated," "wrong," "rights," "oppression," "pressure," "conscience," "principles," and "respect." These words are important because they highlight the ethical aspects of the story.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into a concise 200-word piece, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible. The article is about Gov. Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, who disagree on a religious freedom bill in Arkansas. The bill is criticized for legalizing discrimination against gays. Seth Hutchinson argues it could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. The summary should capture their differing views, their close relationship despite political disagreements, and the broader context of their political evolution.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the conflict, then provide some background on Seth's views and experiences, and conclude with the current status of the bill and the family's ongoing relationship. It's important to highlight the moral framing words to emphasize the ethical dimensions of their disagreement.

I need to ensure the summary is clear, concise, and stays within the word limit. I'll start by outlining the main points: the father-son disagreement, Seth's activism, the bill's implications, and their continued close relationship despite political differences. Then, I'll weave in the moral terms to maintain the ethical focus.

I should also make sure that the summary flows well, connecting each point logically. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language straightforward to ensure clarity. Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the original article's content and maintains the moral framing as required.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faced criticism from his son, Seth, over a religious freedom bill that critics argued could legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson, a labor activist, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas’s reputation and economy. The父子之间的政治分歧由来已久，尽管他们关系亲密。Seth Hutchinson grew up with conservative values but later developed progressive views, influenced by his experiences working low-wage jobs and advocating for gay rights. He has long held differing political opinions from his father, yet they maintain a close relationship. The governor, under mounting pressure, decided to revise the bill, though Seth downplayed his influence, attributing the change to broader pressure. Their story highlights the tension between family ties and political principles, emphasizing the importance of justice and equality.
