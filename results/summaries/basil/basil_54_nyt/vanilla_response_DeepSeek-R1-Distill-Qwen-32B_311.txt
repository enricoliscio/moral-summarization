Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user specified that I should be a news summarizer assistant, so my role is clear. The article is about Governor Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth's differing views on a religious freedom bill in Arkansas.

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The main points are:

1. Governor Hutchinson mentioned his son Seth opposes the bill.
2. Seth has a history of disagreeing with his father on political issues.
3. Seth's views changed when he was a teenager working various jobs, leading him to focus on labor rights and gay rights.
4. Despite their political differences, their family relationship remains strong.
5. The governor is considering changes to the bill, but Seth doesn't take credit for that decision.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should ensure that the summary captures the essence of their relationship and the political context. I'll start by introducing both father and son, their roles, and the bill in question. Then, I'll mention Seth's opposition and his reasons, followed by their ongoing communication and the outcome regarding the bill.

I should avoid including too many details, like specific jobs Seth had, unless they're crucial. The focus should be on their relationship and the political stance. Also, I need to make sure the summary flows logically, from introducing the issue to their differing views and the current status.

Let me structure it step by step:

- Introduce Asa Hutchinson and the bill.
- Mention Seth's opposition and their relationship.
- Explain Seth's background and how his views evolved.
- Highlight their ongoing communication despite disagreements.
- Conclude with the governor's reconsideration of the bill and Seth's take on his influence.

I should keep sentences concise and make sure each sentence adds value without redundancy. Also, I need to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all key points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson revealed that his son, Seth, opposes the state's proposed religious freedom bill, which critics argue could legalize discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. Seth, a labor activist in Texas, has long held differing political views from his father, though their relationship remains close. Seth's opposition to the bill stems from concerns about its impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy. His political views evolved during his teenage years, when he became passionate about labor rights and gay rights after witnessing financial hardships faced by workers and observing the arrest of a closeted gay teacher. Despite their disagreements, the Hutchinsons maintain a strong family bond, with regular communication and annual gatherings. The governor has indicated he may revise the bill, though Seth credits broader pressure, not his influence, for the reconsideration. END OF SUMMARY.
