Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Gov. Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, who have differing political views, especially regarding a religious freedom bill in Arkansas. The article talks about their relationship, Seth's background, and how he influenced his father to reconsider the bill.

First, I should identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "discrimination," "justice," "values," "frustrated," "harsh," "equality," "oppression," "freedom," "oppression," "pressure," "compromise," "integrity," and "activist." These words highlight the moral aspects of their debate.

Now, for the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of those moral terms as possible. I'll start by introducing the Hutchinsons and their political differences. Then, mention the religious freedom bill and Seth's concerns about discrimination. I'll touch on Seth's background, his experiences leading him to focus on justice and equality. Include how he communicated his concerns to his father and the outcome where the governor decided to revise the bill, emphasizing that Seth didn't take credit for swaying his father but that it was due to external pressures. Highlight their ongoing relationship despite their political differences.

I should ensure the summary flows well and captures the moral nuances without getting bogged down in too many details. Keeping it concise while preserving the key moral points is essential. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral framing.
