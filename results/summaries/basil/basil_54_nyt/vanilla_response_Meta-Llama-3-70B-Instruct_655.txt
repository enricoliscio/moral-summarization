SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their differing political views, the two have a close relationship. Seth, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, wrote to his father warning that the bill could harm Arkansas' reputation and economy. This is not the first time they have disagreed on political issues, but Seth says they remain close despite their differences. Seth's views shifted from his family's conservative values as he worked low-paying jobs and saw friends struggle with financial hardships. He became interested in gay rights after a teacher was arrested for being gay. The governor has announced plans to revise or recall parts of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, saying his father is rethinking the bill due to pressure from all sides.
