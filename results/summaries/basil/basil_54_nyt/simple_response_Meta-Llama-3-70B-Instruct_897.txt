SUMMARY:

In Arkansas, Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom" bill, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, the two have a close relationship, with Seth saying he loves and respects his father. However, Seth's views began to diverge from his family's conservative values as a teenager, when he worked low-wage jobs and saw the struggles of older workers. He also became interested in gay rights after witnessing the arrest of a closeted gay teacher. Seth, now a labor activist in Texas, has maintained a robust political dialogue with his father, even as their views have grown further apart. While the governor has announced plans to revise the bill, Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to broader public pressure. The story highlights the complexities of family relationships and the importance of standing up for one's values, even when they differ from those of loved ones.
