SUMMARY:

In Arkansas, Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, the two have a close relationship, with Seth describing his father as someone he loves and respects. Seth's views began to diverge from his family's conservative values during his teenage years, as he worked low-paying jobs and saw the struggles of older workers. He also became interested in gay rights after witnessing the arrest of a gay art teacher who was forced to keep his sexual orientation hidden. Seth, now a labor activist, has communicated his concerns to his father, who has since announced plans to revise or recall the bill. Seth humbly attributes the change of heart to pressure from all sides, rather than his own influence. The story highlights the complexities of family relationships and the importance of standing up for one's values, even when they differ from those of loved ones.
