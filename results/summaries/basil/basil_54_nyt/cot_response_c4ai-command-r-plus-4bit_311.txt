SUMMARY:
Seth Hutchinson, the son of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, has publicly criticized a "religious freedom bill" that critics say would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, father and son have a close relationship, with Seth describing himself as the family's political "black sheep." Seth's moral convictions were shaped by his early work experiences, where he witnessed the financial hardships faced by older workers in low-paying jobs. He also became an advocate for gay rights after witnessing the discrimination faced by a gay art teacher who was arrested for loitering. Despite their divergent views, Seth has always been willing to defend his morals and engage in robust political discussions with his father. While Seth does not take credit for his father's decision to reconsider the bill, his stance adds to the pressure the governor is facing from multiple sides.
