SUMMARY:

In a remarkable display of moral courage, Seth Hutchinson, son of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill" that critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their close relationship, Seth, a labor activist, has taken a strong stance against the bill, warning his father that it could damage the state's reputation and economy. This is not a new development, as Seth has been concerned with justice and has disagreed with his father on political issues for years. His views began to diverge from his family's conservative values when he was 15 and saw the financial hardships faced by older workers in low-paying jobs. He also became interested in gay rights around the same time, inspired by the stories of friends and a gay art teacher who was arrested for being gay. Seth's actions demonstrate that even in the face of familial disagreement, one can stand up for what is right and just.

END OF SUMMARY.
