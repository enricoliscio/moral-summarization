Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and his son Seth. The governor is considering a religious freedom bill that critics say allows discrimination against gays. Seth Hutchinson opposes this bill and has spoken out against it. The article talks about their relationship, how Seth has differing political views from his father, and how he's been an activist for labor and gay rights. It also mentions their close family ties despite political disagreements.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like Seth's concern for justice and his father's stance on the bill. Also, the impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy is important. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the bill, Seth's opposition, their relationship, Seth's background leading to his views, and the outcome where the governor might revise the bill.

I should structure it to highlight the moral conflict between father and son, their differing views, and how it reflects broader societal issues. I'll make sure to mention that Seth didn't claim to change his father's mind, but the governor is reconsidering due to external pressure.

Let me put this together, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the governor and the bill, introduce Seth's opposition, explain his background, their relationship, and conclude with the governor's potential action.

SUMMARY: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson faced criticism from his son, Seth, over a pending "religious freedom" bill that critics argue could legalize discrimination against gay individuals. Seth, a labor activist and organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their political differences, the Hutchinsons maintain a close family relationship. Seth, who describes himself as the family's political "black sheep," developed his progressive views during his teenage years while working low-wage jobs and becoming aware of social injustices, including gay rights issues. He has long held differing political opinions from his father, though they communicate regularly and gather as a family. Seth emphasized that his influence on his father's decision to reconsider the bill was minimal, attributing the change to broader external pressures. END OF SUMMARY.
