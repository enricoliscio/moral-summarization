SUMMARY: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, revealed that his son, Seth Hutchinson, had opposed a controversial "religious freedom" bill pending in the state. Seth, 31, is an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union and has a history of political activism, often at odds with his father's conservative views. Despite their differences, the two maintain a close relationship, and Seth has been vocal about his support for gay rights and labor issues since his teenage years. Seth's opposition to the bill, which critics say would legalize discrimination against gay people, was not a surprise to those familiar with the family. The governor, facing pressure from multiple sides, has since asked lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill. However, Seth is reluctant to take credit for his father's change of heart, attributing it instead to the mounting pressure from various sources. The Hutchinsons' story illustrates how political differences can coexist within a family, with respectful dialogue and engagement prevailing despite divergent views.
