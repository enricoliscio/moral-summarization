Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through it first. The article is about Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and his son Seth, who opposes a religious freedom bill. The bill is controversial because critics say it allows discrimination against gays. 

I should start by identifying the key points. The governor mentioned his son's resistance, which isn't a big surprise because Seth has always been concerned with justice. Seth wrote a letter warning the bill could hurt Arkansas's reputation and economy. Their relationship is close, but they disagree politically. 

Seth's background is important too. He grew up with conservative values but shifted towards progressive views, especially regarding labor rights and gay rights. He became a labor activist in Texas. Despite their differences, they communicate regularly and stay close.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like Seth's concern for justice and how the bill affects discrimination. Also, highlight their respectful relationship despite political disagreements. Keep it under 200 words, focusing on the main events and moral implications.
