SUMMARY: The son of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, publicly opposed a "religious freedom" bill that critics say would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson, 31, has long been the political "black sheep" of his family, with views that differ greatly from his father's. Despite this, the two have a close relationship and regularly engage in political discussions. Seth Hutchinson's political views began to shift when he was a teenager and worked low-paying jobs, witnessing the financial hardships faced by older workers. He also became interested in gay rights after a gay art teacher was arrested on loitering charges. While Governor Hutchinson has asked lawmakers to recall or rewrite the bill, Seth Hutchinson refuses to take credit for his father's decision, attributing it instead to pressure from various sides.
END OF SUMMARY.
