SUMMARY: Seth Hutchinson, the son of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, has publicly opposed a "religious freedom" bill currently pending in the state, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their differing political views, the father and son maintain a close relationship, with Seth expressing his concerns about the bill's potential negative impact on the state's reputation and economy. Seth's political awareness and activism developed at an early age, influenced by his family's involvement in politics and his own experiences working low-paying jobs and witnessing the financial struggles of older workers. He became interested in gay rights during his teens and joined organizations like the Young Democratic Socialists while in college. While Gov. Hutchinson has acknowledged his son's opposition to the bill, Seth remains humble, attributing his father's reevaluation of the bill to pressure from various sources.
