Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and the moral elements.

The article is about Governor Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, who has differing political views. The main issue is the religious freedom bill in Arkansas, which critics say could legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth Hutchinson wrote to his father, warning about the bill's impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy. The author uses words like justice, discrimination, reputation, economy, love, arrest, loiter, joined, rallied, ask, recall, rewrite, credit.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between father and son, the moral implications of the bill, and Seth's role in influencing the governor. I need to keep it under 200 words and include the morally framed words.

Starting with the governor's mention of his son's resistance, then Seth's background in justice and his political evolution. Then, the bill's criticism for discrimination, Seth's warning about reputation and economy. The governor's response to recall or rewrite the bill. Seth's refusal to take credit, emphasizing the pressure from all sides. Their ongoing relationship despite political differences.

I need to make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate. Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring it's concise and captures all necessary points without losing the moral context.

SUMMARY: Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faced resistance to the religious freedom bill from his son, Seth, who has long been concerned with justice. Seth, a labor activist, warned that the bill could legalize discrimination against gay people, harming Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their politically complex relationship, Seth emphasized their love and closeness, though they often disagree on political issues. Seth's views evolved during his teenage years, influenced by witnessing financial hardships and becoming interested in gay rights. He joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists and rallied for gay rights during Gov. Mike Huckabee's tenure. On Wednesday, the governor announced he would ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of the bill, though Seth refused to take credit, attributing the change to the pressure on his father from all sides. Their relationship remains strong, with lively political discussions. END OF SUMMARY.
