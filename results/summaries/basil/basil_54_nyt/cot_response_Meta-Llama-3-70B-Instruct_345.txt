SUMMARY:
Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas is facing resistance from his son, Seth Hutchinson, over a religious freedom bill that critics say would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, wrote to his father warning that the proposal could damage Arkansas' reputation and economy. Despite their political differences, the two have a close and loving relationship. Seth's views on justice and rights have evolved over time, influenced by his experiences working low-paying jobs and witnessing the hardships faced by older workers. He has been an advocate for gay rights since his teenage years. The governor has announced plans to revise the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. END OF SUMMARY.
