SUMMARY:
Gov. Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's religious freedom bill, warning that it could legalize discrimination against gay people and damage Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their political differences, the two have a close and loving relationship. Seth, a labor activist, has always been concerned with justice and has been vocal about his views, even as a high school student. His views began to diverge from his father's when he saw older workers struggling financially in low-paying jobs, and he became interested in gay rights after witnessing the arrest of a gay art teacher. The governor has announced plans to revise the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, saying his father is rethinking the proposal due to pressure from all sides. END OF SUMMARY.
