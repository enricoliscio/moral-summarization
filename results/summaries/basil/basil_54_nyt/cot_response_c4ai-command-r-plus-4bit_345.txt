SUMMARY:
Seth Hutchinson, the son of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, has publicly opposed a "religious freedom" bill that critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their close relationship, Seth and Asa have differing political views, with Seth being the family's "black sheep." Seth's political awakening began during his teenage years when he witnessed the financial hardships of older workers in low-paying jobs and experienced the arrest of a gay art teacher who couldn't be open about his sexuality. As Seth's views *diverged* from his father's, he became an advocate for gay rights and labor activism, regularly contacting his cousin, a state representative, to express his opinions. When the "religious freedom" bill was proposed, Seth warned his father of its potential harm to Arkansas' reputation and economy. While Seth denies *swaying* his father's opinion, Governor Hutchinson has requested lawmakers recall or rewrite the bill, indicating he may be *rethinking* his stance due to pressure from various sources.
