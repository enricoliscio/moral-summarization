SUMMARY: Seth Hutchinson, the son of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, has publicly disagreed with his father over a controversial "religious freedom" bill, arguing that it could lead to discrimination against gay people and damage the state's reputation and economy. Despite their differing political views, the father and son maintain a close relationship, with Seth regularly communicating his views to his father and other members of the influential Hutchinson family in Arkansas. Seth's political awakening came during his teenage years when he worked in low-paying jobs and witnessed the financial struggles of older workers. He also became interested in gay rights after friends came out to him and a gay art teacher was arrested on questionable charges. While Gov. Hutchinson initially supported the bill, he has since asked lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of it in response to pressure from various sides, including his son's moral appeal for justice and fairness. Seth, however, remains humble, refusing to take credit for his father's reconsideration. END OF SUMMARY.
