SUMMARY: Seth Hutchinson, the son of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, has publicly disagreed with his father over a controversial "religious freedom" bill currently being debated in the state. Seth, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union and self-described political "black sheep" of the family, wrote to his father expressing concern that the bill could damage Arkansas's reputation and economy by legalizing discrimination against gay people. Despite their differing political views, Seth and Asa maintain a close relationship, and Seth has been actively engaged in politics from a young age. He traces the origins of his interest in gay rights to his time working low-paying jobs as a teenager and observing the financial hardships faced by older workers, as well as the arrest of a gay art teacher who was forced to stay in the closet. While Seth does not believe he swayed his father's position on the bill, Governor Hutchinson has indicated he will ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite portions of it. END OF SUMMARY.
