Alright, I need to tackle this user's query. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed article about Gov. Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, highlighting their political differences, especially regarding a religious freedom bill in Arkansas.

The user has two main tasks: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and second, write a summary preserving those moral terms. I need to make sure I follow these steps correctly.

Starting with STEP 1: Identifying morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "resistance," "justice," "discrimination," "damage," "values," "frustrated," "wrong," "rights," "rethinking," and "pressure" stand out as they relate to moral or ethical issues.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral terms. I'll focus on the key points: the father-son political disagreement, the bill's potential impact, Seth's arguments about justice and discrimination, their relationship, and the outcome where the governor reconsidered the bill. I'll make sure to include the moral words identified earlier to maintain the original framing.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the article, highlighting the moral aspects without adding personal opinions. It's important to present the facts clearly while emphasizing the ethical dimensions of the story.

I'll structure the summary by introducing the Hutchinsons, their differing views on the bill, Seth's arguments, their relationship, and the governor's response. This way, the moral framing is preserved, and the summary remains informative and within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faced criticism from his son, Seth, over a religious freedom bill that critics argue could legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their political differences, the父子关系 remained close. Seth, who grew up with conservative values, began advocating for justice and gay rights during his teenage years, influenced by personal experiences and witnessing financial hardships faced by workers. The younger Hutchinson has long held differing political views from his father, but they maintain a respectful relationship. On Wednesday, the governor announced he would ask lawmakers to revise the bill, though Seth downplayed his influence, attributing the change to broader pressure.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
