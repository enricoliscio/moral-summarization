SUMMARY:
Gov. Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against the religious freedom bill in Arkansas, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist and organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, has always been concerned with justice and has a history of disagreeing with his father on political issues. Despite their differences, the two have a close and loving relationship. Seth's views began to shift when he was 15 and saw older workers struggling financially in low-paying jobs, realizing that there was something wrong with the system. He also became interested in gay rights around the same time. The governor has announced that he will ask lawmakers to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, saying that his father is rethinking the bill due to pressure from all sides.
