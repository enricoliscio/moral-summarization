SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom bill", which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their political differences, the two have a close relationship and engage in lively discussions. Seth, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, has been concerned with justice and has seen his views diverge from his father's over time. He grew frustrated with financial hardships faced by older workers in low-paying jobs and became interested in gay rights after seeing a gay teacher arrested for being in a park. The governor has announced plans to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to pressure from all sides. The two communicate regularly and gather with the family at least twice a year, engaging in engaging conversations.
