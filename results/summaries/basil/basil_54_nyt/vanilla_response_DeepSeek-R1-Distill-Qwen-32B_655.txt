Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Governor Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth. The article talks about their differing political views, especially regarding the religious freedom bill in Arkansas. Let me break it down.

First, the governor is a Republican from Arkansas, and the article mentions that his son Seth has been critical of the bill. I should note that the son's opposition isn't a big surprise because they've had differing political views for a while.

The bill is controversial because critics say it allows discrimination against gay people. Seth wrote to his dad warning that the bill could hurt Arkansas's reputation and economy. That's a key point to include.

I should also mention how Seth's views developed. He started off following his family's values but changed as he worked various jobs and became more aware of social issues, including gay rights. This background shows why he's against the bill now.

Additionally, the article mentions their relationship. They have a close bond despite their political differences. The governor is considering revising the bill, but Seth downplays his influence, attributing it to broader pressure.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the father-son political differences, the religious freedom bill, Seth's opposition and its impact, his background leading to his views, and their ongoing relationship despite disagreements.

Let me make sure I cover all these aspects without getting too detailed. Also, the summary should end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Seth, a labor activist in Texas, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. The父子俩在政治上长期存在分歧，尽管如此，他们仍保持亲密关系。Seth的政见逐渐改变始于15岁时在餐厅洗碗的经历，他目睹低收入工人经济困难后，开始关注社会正义和同性恋权利。他曾在高中与父亲进行政治讨论，并在大学期间加入左翼组织。尽管 Seth认为父亲重新考虑法案是由于多方压力，而非他的影响，但父子俩仍保持定期沟通。END OF SUMMARY.
