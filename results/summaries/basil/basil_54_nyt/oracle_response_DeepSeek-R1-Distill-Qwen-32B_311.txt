Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about Gov. Asa Hutchinson and his son Seth, who has differing political views. Seth opposes the religious freedom bill, arguing it allows discrimination against gays. The key moral words here are justice, discrimination, reputation, economy, love, arrest, loiter, joined, rallied, ask, recall, rewrite, and credit.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of their relationship and the moral issues involved. 

I'll start by highlighting the father-son relationship and their political differences. Then, mention Seth's concerns about discrimination and the impact on Arkansas's reputation and economy. Include how Seth's views evolved, especially regarding gay rights and labor issues. Finally, note the governor's decision to revise the bill, but Seth downplays his influence.

I should structure the summary to flow naturally, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without making it too lengthy. I'll make sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faced criticism from his son, Seth, over a religious freedom bill that critics argue legalizes discrimination against gay people. Seth, a labor activist, warned his father that the bill could harm Arkansas's reputation and economy. Despite their politically complex relationship, Seth emphasized their close bond, stating, "I love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship." However, their views on political issues, including justice and discrimination, often diverge. Seth's political evolution began in high school, when he became passionate about justice and gay rights after witnessing financial hardships faced by workers and the arrest of a closeted gay teacher. He later joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists and rallied for gay rights. Asa, acknowledging the pressure from all sides, said he would ask lawmakers to recall or rewrite parts of the bill. Seth, however, downplayed his influence, stating, "I did not sway my dad." Their relationship remains strong, with regular communication and family gatherings. END OF SUMMARY.
