SUMMARY:

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson's son, Seth Hutchinson, has spoken out against his father's proposed "religious freedom" bill, which critics argue would legalize discrimination against gay people. Despite their differing political views, the two have a close relationship and regularly communicate. Seth, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union, wrote to his father warning that the bill could harm Arkansas' reputation and economy. This is not the first time they have disagreed on political issues, but Seth says their family stays close despite their differences. Seth's views began to shift in his teenage years, influenced by his experiences working low-wage jobs and witnessing friends' struggles with their sexual orientations. The governor has since announced plans to revise or recall the bill, but Seth refuses to take credit, attributing the change to external pressure.
