SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox publicly rejected Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, stating that Trump is "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to invite Trump, calling it a "big mistake" and a "political risk." Trump responded on Twitter, referencing a past incident where Fox apologized for using profanity to refuse to pay for a border wall. Fox fired back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of lying. The exchange highlights the deep-seated tensions and mistrust between Trump and Mexican leaders, with Fox framing Trump's visit as an affront to Mexican dignity and Trump characteristically responding with defiance and counter-accusations. The moral framing of this exchange suggests that Trump's actions are disrespectful and offensive, and that Mexican leaders have a moral obligation to stand up against his divisive rhetoric.
