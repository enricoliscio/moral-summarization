SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox launched a scathing attack on Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of his visit to Mexico, declaring him "not welcome" in the country and criticizing the current Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for inviting him. Fox's strong moral stance against Trump's offensive remarks about Mexico and its people sparked a heated exchange, with Trump taking to Twitter to defend himself and misrepresent Fox's previous invitation as an apology for using profanity. Fox stood his moral ground, demanding an apology from Trump and calling him out for his lies. This exchange highlights the ethical and political implications of Trump's controversial statements and the strong opposition they evoke, demonstrating the potential consequences of divisive rhetoric in diplomatic relations.
