SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox and Republican nominee Donald Trump engaged in a Twitter feud prior to Trump's visit to Mexico. Fox vehemently opposed Trump's visit, stating that he was *rejected* by Mexico and that President Enrique Pena Nieto was making a *mistake* and risking being *considered a betrayer*. He also demanded an *apology* from Trump for his offensive remarks about building a wall between the two countries. Trump fired back on Twitter, accusing Fox of using profanity in a previous exchange and *lying*. The exchange highlighted the tense relationship between the two figures and the strong opposition to Trump's policies in Mexico.
END OF SUMMARY.
