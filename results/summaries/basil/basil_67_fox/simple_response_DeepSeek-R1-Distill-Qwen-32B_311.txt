Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing that the author provided. The article is about a Twitter war between Donald Trump and former Mexican President Vicente Fox. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the article mentions that before Trump arrived in Mexico, he was involved in a Twitter dispute with Fox. Fox criticized Trump, saying he wasn't welcome in Mexico and that President Peña Nieto was taking a political risk by inviting Trump. Fox called it a big mistake and even suggested Peña might be seen as a traitor.

Then, Trump responded on Twitter, bringing up a past incident where Fox used the 'f bomb' regarding the wall and apologized for it. Trump is pointing out Fox's hypocrisy, implying that Fox invited him before but now is opposing his visit.

Fox then fired back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of lying. The article highlights the tension between the two, with Fox criticizing Trump's policies and Trump countering by bringing up past statements.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements. Fox is portrayed as a critic of Trump, emphasizing that Trump isn't welcome and that Peña is making a mistake. Trump is shown as responding defensively, bringing up past actions to discredit Fox.

I should structure the summary to include both perspectives, showing Fox's criticism and Trump's counter-arguments. Keeping it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but include the key points: Fox's initial criticism, Trump's response referencing the past, and Fox's demand for an apology.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's clear and concise while maintaining the moral framing from the article.
