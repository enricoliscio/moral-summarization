SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's visit to Mexico sparked a Twitter feud with former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who deemed Trump "not welcome" in the country. Fox criticized current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to host Trump, calling it a "big mistake" that would be seen as a "traitorous" act. Fox's strong words were a response to Trump's past offensive comments, which Fox believes should not be taken lightly. Trump, however, fired back on Twitter, accusing Fox of "railing" against him and bringing up a past apology from Fox for using profanity. Fox retorted, calling on Trump to apologize and "stop lying". The exchange highlights the tension and mistrust between Trump and Mexican leaders, with Fox standing firm against Trump's divisive rhetoric.
