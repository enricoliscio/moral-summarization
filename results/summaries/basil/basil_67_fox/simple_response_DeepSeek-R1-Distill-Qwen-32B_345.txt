Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral aspects involved.

The article talks about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the conflict between him and former President Vicente Fox. Fox criticizes Trump, calling him unwelcome and criticizing the current president for inviting Trump. Trump responds on Twitter, bringing up Fox's past comments about the wall. Fox then demands an apology and accuses Trump of lying.

I should highlight the conflict, the criticism from Fox about Trump's unwelcomeness, and Trump's counter-attack using Fox's past statements. Also, note Fox's demand for an apology and the implication of Trump's behavior.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral elements, like Fox's stance against Trump and the accusations of lying. I'll structure it to show the back-and-forth, emphasizing their opposing views and the underlying tensions.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all the key moral points without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.
