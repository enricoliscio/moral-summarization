SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump ahead of his visit to Mexico, declaring that the country rejects the Republican nominee and considers him a source of offense. Fox's outrage was directed not only at Trump but also at current President Enrique Pena Nieto, who invited Trump, calling it a "big mistake" and risking being seen as a traitor. The moral indignation of Fox was evident in his choice of words, railing against Trump's visit and demanding an apology for what he perceived as Trump's lies. Trump, true to form, responded via Twitter, but his attempt to defend himself by referring to Fox's previous apology for using profanity fell flat. The exchange highlighted the deep tensions and the moral outrage that Trump's visit stirred in Mexico.
END OF SUMMARY.
