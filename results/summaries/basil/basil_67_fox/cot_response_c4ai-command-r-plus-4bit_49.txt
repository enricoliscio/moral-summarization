SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox engaged in a Twitter war with Donald Trump, expressing his strong opposition to Trump's visit to Mexico. Fox deemed the visit a "big mistake" and stated that Trump was "not welcome" in Mexico. He accused Trump of offending the country and suggested that President Enrique Pena Nieto was taking a political risk by hosting him, even going as far as to say that he would be considered a "traitor." Trump retaliated on Twitter, claiming that Fox had invited him after apologizing for his previous derogatory remarks. Fox vehemently denied this, demanding an apology from Trump and instructing him to "stop lying." The exchange highlighted the tense relationship between the two figures and the controversial nature of Trump's visit to Mexico. Fox's rejection of Trump's visit stirred strong emotions and underscored the moral dimensions of the political discourse surrounding the U.S.-Mexico relationship. END OF SUMMARY.
