SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox engaged in a Twitter war with Donald Trump ahead of the latter's visit to Mexico. Fox vehemently opposed Trump's visit, stating that he was "not welcome" and that Mexico "reject[s] his visit." Fox criticized President Enrique Pena Nieto for inviting Trump, suggesting that Nieto would be considered a "traitor" for hosting someone who had offended Mexico. Trump retaliated on Twitter, bringing up Fox's previous apology for his profane remark about Trump's wall proposal. Fox responded by demanding Trump apologize and "stop lying." The exchange highlights the tense relationship between Trump and Mexico, with Fox's strong opposition serving as a reminder of the controversial nature of Trump's presence in the country.
