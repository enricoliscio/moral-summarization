SUMMARY: A war of words erupted between former Mexican President Vicente Fox and Republican nominee Donald Trump, highlighting the contentious relationship between the two. In a display of moral outrage, Fox vehemently opposed Trump's visit to Mexico, expressing the sentiment of the Mexican people in rejecting his offensive remarks and questioning the decision of the current President, Enrique Pena Nieto. Fox's strong stance against Trump's inflammatory rhetoric earned him a backlash from Trump, who took to Twitter to misrepresent Fox's previous invitation as an apology for his expletive-laden criticism of Trump's wall proposal. Fox, refusing to back down, demanded an apology from Trump and called him out for his deception. This exchange underscores the deep moral divide between the two figures and their respective nations, with Fox defending Mexico's honor and Trump doubling down on his divisive rhetoric.

END OF SUMMARY.
