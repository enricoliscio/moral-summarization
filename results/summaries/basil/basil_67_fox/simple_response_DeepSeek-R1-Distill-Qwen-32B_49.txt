Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Donald Trump visiting Mexico and the conflict with former President Vicente Fox. Fox criticized Trump, calling him unwelcome and criticizing the current president for inviting Trump. He accused the current president of taking a political risk and even called him a traitor. Trump responded on Twitter, bringing up Fox's past actions, like apologizing for using the 'f bomb' regarding the wall and not paying for it. Fox then demanded an apology from Trump, accusing him of lying.

The moral framing here seems to be about respect, honesty, and political responsibility. Fox is portrayed as someone standing up for his country's values, opposing Trump's policies and rhetoric. Trump, on the other hand, is shown as someone who uses past statements to defend himself, possibly being dishonest.

I need to make sure the summary captures this conflict, the criticism from Fox, Trump's response, and the underlying moral issues like honesty and respect. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's arrival, Fox's criticism, Trump's response, Fox's demand, and the moral implications. Make sure to include the key points without going into too much detail.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, ensure the summary flows naturally and highlights the moral aspects as presented in the original article.
