Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally charged words provided: hosting, offended, mistake, railing, lying. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about a Twitter feud between Donald Trump and former Mexican President Vicente Fox. Fox criticizes Trump's invitation by the current president, calling it a mistake and saying Trump isn't welcome. Trump responds by bringing up a past incident where Fox used offensive language about a wall.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral terms. I'll start by noting Fox's criticism of hosting Trump, which he sees as a mistake. Then, I'll mention Fox's statement that they were offended by Trump's comments. Next, I'll include Trump's counterattack, where he accuses Fox of lying about the wall. 

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Fox's criticism, then Trump's response, and the resulting conflict. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it: Fox criticizes hosting Trump, calls it a mistake, says they're offended. Trump responds by accusing Fox of lying about the wall. The feud escalates on Twitter. That should cover the key points with the moral terms intact.

I think that's a solid summary. I'll make sure to use all the required words and keep it within the word limit. Double-checking the word count to ensure compliance.
