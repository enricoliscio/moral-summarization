Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully. 

First, I'll read the news article to understand the context. It's about Donald Trump and Vicente Fox exchanging heated words on Twitter. Fox is criticizing Trump, saying he's not welcome in Mexico, and Trump is countering by bringing up past comments from Fox. 

The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words. I remember that moral framing involves words that carry strong positive or negative connotations. So, I'll go through the article and pick out words like "Twitter war," "tear," "not welcome," "critic," "disagree," "reject," "enormous political risk," "traitor," "offended," "big mistake," "apologize," "lying." Each of these words carries a moral judgment.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without making it too long. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to show the conflict between Trump and Fox, highlighting the moral language used by both parties.

I should make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content. I'll mention Fox's criticism, Trump's response, and the specific moral terms each used. Keeping it concise but comprehensive is key here.

I think I've covered all the steps. Now, I'll put it all together, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep the summary within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump found himself embroiled in a Twitter war with former Mexican President Vicente Fox before his visit to Mexico. Fox, a vocal critic of Trump, declared the Republican nominee "not welcome" in Mexico and criticized President Enrique Peña Nieto for inviting Trump, calling it a "big mistake" and an "enormous political risk." Fox accused Peña Nieto of potentially being seen as a "traitor" for hosting Trump, whom Fox described as "offensive." Trump responded by tweeting that Fox had previously invited him, referencing Fox's past criticism of the border wall. Fox fired back, demanding Trump "apologize" and "stop lying." The exchange highlighted the intense political and moral tensions surrounding Trump's visit.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
