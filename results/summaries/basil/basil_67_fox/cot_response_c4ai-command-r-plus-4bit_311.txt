SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox and Republican nominee Donald Trump got into a Twitter war prior to Trump's visit to Mexico. Fox expressed his strong disapproval of current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to invite Trump, stating that Trump "is not welcome" in Mexico and that his visit is considered a "big mistake" and an "enormous political risk." He further emphasized that Trump's offensive remarks towards Mexico have caused outrage and that any meeting with him would be seen as a betrayal. Trump responded to Fox's criticism by alluding to Fox's previous apology for his own inflammatory language. Fox then demanded an apology from Trump and called him out for lying. The exchange highlights the tense relationship between the two figures and the strong moral objections many in Mexico hold towards Trump's rhetoric and policies. END OF SUMMARY.
