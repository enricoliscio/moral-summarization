SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's visit to Mexico sparked a Twitter war with former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who declared the Republican nominee "not welcome" in the country. Fox, a vocal critic of Trump, criticized current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to host Trump, calling it a "big mistake" that would make Pena look like a "traitor". Fox expressed outrage, saying Mexicans were "offended" by Trump's words and didn't want him in the country. Trump fired back, accusing Fox of hypocrisy and "lying" about inviting him in the past. Fox responded, demanding an apology and telling Trump to stop "railing" against him. The exchange highlights the deep-seated tensions between Trump and Mexican leaders, with Fox accusing Trump of disrespecting the country and its people.
