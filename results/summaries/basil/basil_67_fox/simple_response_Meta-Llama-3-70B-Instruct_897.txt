SUMMARY:

In a Twitter exchange, former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump, saying he's "not welcome" in Mexico and that the current president's decision to invite Trump is a "big mistake." Fox criticized Trump's past offensive remarks, implying that hosting him would be a betrayal to the Mexican people. Trump responded by bringing up a past incident where Fox apologized for using profanity to refuse to pay for a border wall. Fox fired back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of lying. The exchange highlights the deep-seated tensions between Trump and Mexican leaders, with Fox standing up for his country's dignity and Trump refusing to back down. The moral of the story is that respect and accountability are essential in international diplomacy, and that leaders should prioritize the dignity and well-being of their people over political expediency.
