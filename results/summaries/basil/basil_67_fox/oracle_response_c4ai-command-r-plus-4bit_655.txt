SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump ahead of the then-Republican nominee's visit to Mexico, declaring that he was "not welcome" in the country and that the Mexican people "reject his visit." Fox's outrage was prompted by Trump's controversial proposals, such as building a wall along the US-Mexico border, and he warned that President Enrique Pena Nieto was "taking an enormous political risk" by hosting Trump. He further emphasized that Trump's behavior was offensive and that his visit was a mistake that could be seen as a betrayal. True to form, Trump retaliated on Twitter, accusing Fox of lying and bringing up their previous exchange where Fox had used profanity. Fox stood his ground, demanding an apology from Trump and reiterating his strong opposition to the visit.
