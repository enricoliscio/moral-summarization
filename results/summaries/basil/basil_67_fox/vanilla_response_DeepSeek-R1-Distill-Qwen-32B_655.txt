Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Donald Trump and former Mexican President Vicente Fox having a Twitter war before Trump's visit to Mexico. 

Hmm, Fox criticized Trump on CNN, saying he's not welcome in Mexico and that President Peña Nieto is taking a big political risk by inviting Trump. He called it a mistake and even a betrayal. That's pretty strong language. 

Then Trump responded on Twitter, bringing up Fox's past comments about the wall. Specifically, Fox used the 'f bomb' when talking about not paying for the wall. Trump is pointing that out to counter Fox's criticism. 

Fox then fired back on Twitter, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of lying. So it's a back-and-forth between the two, with Fox being critical and Trump using Fox's past statements against him. 

I should make sure the summary includes all key points: Fox's criticism, Trump's response referencing Fox's past comments, and Fox's demand for an apology. Also, the context of Trump's upcoming visit to Mexico is important. 

I need to keep it under 200 words and make it concise. Let me structure it step by step. First, mention Fox's criticism on CNN, then Trump's tweet referencing the 'f bomb' comment, followed by Fox's response. 

Wait, the user also specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include those tokens as well. 

Let me put it all together in a clear and concise manner, ensuring all main points are covered without going over the word limit.
