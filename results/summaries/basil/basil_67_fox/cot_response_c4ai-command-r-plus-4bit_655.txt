SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump ahead of his visit to Mexico, declaring that the Republican nominee is "not welcome" in the country. Fox, a vocal critic of Trump, strongly opposed current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to invite Trump, calling it a "big mistake." He further stated that Trump would be considered a "traitor" for his offensive remarks about Mexico and his proposed border wall. Trump, true to form, responded via Twitter, referencing a previous apology from Fox for his own profane comments about Trump's wall. This sparked a heated exchange, with Fox demanding an apology from Trump and calling him out for lying. The exchange highlights the tense relationship between the two figures and the strong moral objections many in Mexico hold towards Trump's rhetoric and policies. END OF SUMMARY.
