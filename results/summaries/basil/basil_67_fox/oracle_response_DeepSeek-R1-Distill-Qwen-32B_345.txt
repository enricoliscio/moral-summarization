Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a sample summary, but I need to make sure I understand the process they went through. 

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about Donald Trump and Vicente Fox's Twitter war before Trump's visit to Mexico. Fox criticized Trump, calling him unwelcome and criticizing President Pe単a Nieto for inviting him. Trump responded by bringing up Fox's past comments about the wall. 

The author used specific morally charged words: hosting, offended, mistake, railing, lying. I need to include these in the summary. 

I should start by identifying the main points: Fox's criticism, Trump's response, and the implications of their conflict. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes those key moral terms.

I should structure the summary to first mention Fox's disapproval, then Trump's visit, Fox's comments on CNN, the criticism of Pe単a Nieto, Trump's tweet referencing Fox's past statement, and Fox's response. 

I also need to highlight the political risk and the tension between them. Using words like "hosting," "offended," "mistake," "railing," and "lying" will maintain the moral framing.

I should avoid adding any extra information not in the article and keep it neutral, just summarizing the events with the specified moral language. 

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary that flows well and includes all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has sparked a heated Twitter exchange with Donald Trump over the latter's planned visit to Mexico. Fox criticized Trump, calling him "not welcome" and accusing President Enrique Pe単a Nieto of taking a "political risk" by hosting him. He labeled Trump's visit a "big mistake" and accused Pe単a of appearing "traitorous" for allowing Trump to enter the country. Trump responded by tweeting that Fox had previously invited him, referencing Fox's past statement about the border wall. Fox fired back, demanding Trump apologize and "stop lying." The exchange highlights tensions between the two figures and underscores the controversy surrounding Trump's visit.  
END OF SUMMARY.
