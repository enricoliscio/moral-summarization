Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Trump and Vicente Fox. Let me read through the article first. It seems like Fox is criticizing Trump's visit to Mexico, saying he's not welcome. He's talking about how President Peña Nieto is taking a risk by inviting Trump. Trump responds on Twitter, bringing up a past incident where Fox used the 'f bomb' regarding the wall. Then Fox fires back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of lying.

I need to make sure the summary captures all the key points: Fox's criticism, Trump's response referencing the wall comment, and Fox's demand. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and to the point. Also, the user specified to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should avoid any markdown and just use plain text. Let me structure the summary to include the main actors, their arguments, and the back-and-forth on Twitter. That should cover the essential details without getting too bogged down in specifics.
