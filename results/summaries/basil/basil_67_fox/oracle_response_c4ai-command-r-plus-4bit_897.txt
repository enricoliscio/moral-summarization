SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox launched a Twitter tirade against Donald Trump ahead of the then-Republican nominee's visit to Mexico, declaring that Trump was "not welcome" in the country and that the Mexican people rejected his visit. Fox criticized Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for hosting Trump, calling it a "big mistake" and suggesting that it could be seen as an offense to the country. Trump responded to Fox's railing with a tweet of his own, falsely accusing Fox of inviting him to Mexico and demanding an apology for his alleged lying.
