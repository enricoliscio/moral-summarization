SUMMARY:

In a Twitter feud, former Mexican President Vicente Fox declared Donald Trump "not welcome" in Mexico, criticizing current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to invite Trump for a meeting. Fox expressed outrage, stating that Trump's visit is a "big mistake" and that Pena Nieto will be seen as a "traitor" for hosting him. Trump retaliated on Twitter, bringing up Fox's past apology for using profanity when referring to Trump's proposed border wall. Fox fired back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of lying. The exchange highlights the deep-seated resentment and mistrust towards Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies, particularly among those who have been directly affected by his words. The moral framing of this incident emphasizes the importance of accountability, honesty, and respect in international diplomacy.
