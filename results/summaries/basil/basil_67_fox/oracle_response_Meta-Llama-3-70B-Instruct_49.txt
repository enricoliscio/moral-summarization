SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's visit to Mexico sparked a Twitter feud with former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who deemed Trump "not welcome" in the country. Fox, a vocal critic of Trump, slammed current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to host the Republican nominee, calling it a "big mistake" that would make Pena Nieto look like a "traitor". Fox expressed outrage that Trump would visit with a "smile on his face" after making offensive comments. Trump retaliated on Twitter, accusing Fox of hypocrisy for inviting him in the past despite criticizing his stance on the border wall. Fox fired back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of "lying". The exchange highlights the tension between Trump's controversial rhetoric and Mexico's strong rejection of his policies.
