SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox slammed Donald Trump's visit to Mexico, declaring him "not welcome" in the country. Fox, an outspoken critic of Trump, rejected the current President's decision to invite the Republican nominee, calling it a "big mistake" that would be seen as a "traitor"-like move. Trump fired back on Twitter, but Fox demanded an apology and accused Trump of "lying". The Twitter war escalated, with Fox calling Trump out for his past offenses, including his infamous proposal for a border wall. Fox's strong stance against Trump's visit was rooted in his belief that Mexico should not be "offended" by Trump's presence. The controversy highlights the deep-seated tensions between Trump and Mexico, with Fox leading the charge against the billionaire's divisive rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
