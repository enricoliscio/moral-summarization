SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox declared that Donald Trump is "not welcome" in Mexico, stating that "we don't like him" and "we reject his visit." Fox criticized current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to invite Trump, calling it an "enormous political risk" and labeling it a "big mistake." Trump responded on Twitter, but Fox fired back, demanding an apology and accusing Trump of "lying." The exchange was sparked by Trump's visit to Mexico, which Fox deemed an "offense" and a "mistake." Fox even went so far as to call Pena Nieto a "traitor" for hosting Trump. The Twitter war highlights the strong opposition to Trump's presence in Mexico, with Fox insisting that Trump is not welcome and should apologize for his actions. END OF SUMMARY.
