SUMMARY:

A Twitter war erupted between Donald Trump and former Mexican President Vicente Fox after Fox declared Trump "not welcome" in Mexico. Fox, an outspoken critic of Trump, disagreed with current President Enrique Pena Nieto's decision to host Trump, calling it a "big mistake" that would be seen as a "traitorous" act. Fox emphasized that Mexicans were "offended" by Trump's previous comments and didn't want him to visit with a "smile on his face." Trump fired back, accusing Fox of "railing" against him and "lying" about their past interactions. The exchange ended with Fox demanding an apology from Trump and telling him to "stop lying."

The moral framing of the article highlights the perceived wrongdoing of Trump's visit and the offense taken by Fox and the Mexican people. The use of words like "mistake," "offended," "railing," and "lying" emphasizes the negative moral judgment of Trump's actions.
