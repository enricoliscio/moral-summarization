Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Donald Trump and former Mexican President Vicente Fox having a Twitter war. 

So, Trump is visiting Mexico, and Fox is really against it. He told CNN that Trump isn't welcome and criticized the current president for inviting him. Fox thinks it's a big political risk and even called it a mistake. 

Trump responded on Twitter, bringing up a past incident where Fox used the "f bomb" and apologized. Trump is pointing out that Fox invited him despite that. Fox then asked Trump to apologize and stop lying. 

I should capture the key points: Fox's criticism, Trump's response referencing the wall comment, and the ongoing Twitter battle. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include both sides and the main conflict. 

Let me structure it: Start with Fox's comments, then Trump's response, and the resulting Twitter fight. Make sure it's clear and flows well. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it straightforward. 

Okay, time to put it all together in a summary that's under 200 words.
