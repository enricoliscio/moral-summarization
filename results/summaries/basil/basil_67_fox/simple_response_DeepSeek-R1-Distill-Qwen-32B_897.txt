Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article is about Donald Trump and Vicente Fox having a Twitter war before Trump's visit to Mexico. Fox criticized Trump, saying he's not welcome and called Trump's visit a mistake. Trump responded by bringing up Fox's past comments, specifically about the wall and the 'f bomb' incident. Fox then demanded an apology and accused Trump of lying.

I should capture the key points: the Twitter exchange, Fox's criticism, Trump's response, and the moral implications each side is highlighting. I need to make sure the summary reflects the conflict and the underlying issues they're addressing, like respect and truthfulness.

Let me structure it: start with the conflict, mention Fox's criticism, Trump's counter, and Fox's demand. Keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral elements are clear. I'll avoid any markdown and just write a straightforward summary.
