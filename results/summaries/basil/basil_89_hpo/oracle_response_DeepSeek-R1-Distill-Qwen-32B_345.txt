Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user has provided a list of these words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary awkward.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mattis's resignation, his role in the administration, his disagreements with Trump, and the implications of his departure. The key moral terms include progress, sound, improving, reforming, etc.

I'll start by noting Mattis's decision to step down and the reasons he gave, such as differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. I should use "step down" and "right" here. Then, mention the budget increase and the goals like improving readiness and reforming practices, using those terms.

Next, I'll address the conflicts with Trump, like the Syria withdrawal and the Iran deal. Here, I can use words like "strength" and "undermine." Also, mention Mattis's opposition to the transgender ban and torture, using "oppose."

Finally, I'll touch on Mattis's influence and the impact of his departure on the administration, using "prevail" and "sustain."

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral language flows naturally. I'll structure each sentence to include the appropriate terms without forcing them in. Let me draft a summary that hits all these points and then check the word count.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his retirement, effective February 28, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis emphasized the progress made in strengthening the military, improving readiness, and reforming the Department of Defense's practices. He praised the U.S. military's ability to provide capabilities to prevail in conflicts and sustain global influence. However, Mattis and Trump disagreed on key issues, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis opposed Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. His resignation highlights a major split with Trump over Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Mattis viewed Putin's actions as undercutting Western ideals, while Trump praised Putin's leadership. Mattis's departure follows a series of high-profile exits from the administration, underscoring the administration's challenges in maintaining cohesion. END OF SUMMARY.
