SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will be retiring at the end of February, as announced by President Donald Trump on Twitter. Mattis, who served over four decades in the military, was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks and had differing views with the President on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted the progress made on key defense goals, but also noted his disagreement with Trump on issues like Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. The news comes after Trump's abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed. Mattis' departure adds to the growing list of high-profile departures from the administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Tom Price. The White House had been discussing potential replacements for Mattis, with names like Gen. Jack Keane and Sen. Tom Cotton reportedly under consideration.
