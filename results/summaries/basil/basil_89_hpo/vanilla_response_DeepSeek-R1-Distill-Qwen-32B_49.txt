Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Jim Mattis's resignation. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that President Trump tweeted about Mattis retiring at the end of February. Mattis was a key figure in Trump's administration, known for supporting military strength. He's been in the Pentagon for over four decades. The budget increased significantly under his tenure.

Mattis's resignation letter highlights achievements in military readiness and budget management but also mentions differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Trump withdrew troops from Syria against Mattis's advice, which seems to be a point of contention.

There are reports about potential replacements, but Trump denied planning a change. Mattis has been critical of Trump's understanding, which was denied by Mattis. They also differ on Russia's role and the Iran nuclear deal, with Trump pulling out while Mattis wanted to stay.

Additionally, Mattis opposed Trump's transgender ban and the use of torture. His public role included handling airstrikes in Syria, where he disagreed with Trump on seeking congressional approval.

The administration has seen several high-profile departures, including Tillerson and others, indicating a pattern of turnover.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the main points: Mattis's resignation, his achievements, disagreements with Trump on key issues, potential replacements, and the broader context of administration turnover.
