SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will retire at the end of February, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday. Mattis, who served over four decades in the military, has made significant progress in strengthening the military and improving its combat readiness. In his resignation letter, Mattis highlighted the progress made in putting the Department on a sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in forces, and reforming business practices for greater performance. However, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, leading to Mattis' decision to step down. Mattis' departure comes after Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed. The move has raised concerns that it would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis' resignation is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the Trump administration. Despite their differences, Mattis emphasized the importance of sustaining strong U.S. global influence and prevailing in conflict.
