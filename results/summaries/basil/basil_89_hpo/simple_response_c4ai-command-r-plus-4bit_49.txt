SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's first Cabinet picks, is retiring at the end of February. Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure and worked to improve readiness and lethality in U.S. forces. However, he and Trump had differing views on key issues, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, the approach to Russia and China, and the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted these differences, stating that Trump had a right to a Defense Secretary whose views aligned more closely with his own. Mattis had previously been at odds with Trump on other issues, such as the proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. His departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Reince Priebus. Mattis' resignation underscores the ethical and ideological conflicts within the administration and raises questions about the stability and coherence of Trump's leadership.
END OF SUMMARY.
