Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's resignation. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning Trump's tweet that Mattis is retiring at the end of February. Mattis has been a key figure in Trump's administration, especially with his focus on military strength. The budget increase is a big point, so I should include that.

Mattis's resignation letter mentions disagreements with Trump on Russia and China. That's important because it shows the reason behind his departure. Also, Trump's recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria went against Mattis's advice, which is another key point.

I should note the budget hike, the main achievements Mattis mentions, and the disagreements on foreign policy. Additionally, the potential replacements are mentioned, but I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to cover Mattis's tenure, his achievements, the disagreements, and the impact of his departure. Also, mention Trump's denial of looking for a replacement and the context of the Woodward book.

I should avoid including too many minor details to keep it brief. Make sure to highlight the main reasons for Mattis's resignation and the implications for Trump's administration.
