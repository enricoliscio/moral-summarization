Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Mattis leaving Trump's administration, but they also want the moral framing preserved. Hmm, okay. First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points. 

The article mentions Mattis's long military career, his role in Trump's administration, and his support for military strengthening. It also talks about the budget increase and his resignation. The moral aspect comes into play with his differing views on Russia and China, and his opposition to some of Trump's policies like the transgender ban and the Syria withdrawal.

I should highlight the contrast between Mattis's strategic approach and Trump's decisions. Also, the mention of Mattis's criticism of Putin versus Trump's praise is a key moral point. I need to make sure the summary reflects the tension between Mattis's principles and Trump's actions, especially regarding military strategy and international relations.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it so that the moral framing is clear. Maybe start with Mattis's resignation, then touch on his achievements, his disagreements with Trump, and the implications of his departure. I should also mention the potential replacements and the book that criticized Trump, as that adds context to the moral dimension.

I'll make sure to include the key points: Mattis's support for military strength, budget increase, his departure due to policy disagreements, opposition to Trump's decisions, and the broader context of administration changes. That should cover the main aspects while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignation, effective February 28, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general and key figure in Trump's administration, supported military strengthening and budget increases, but opposed Trump's decisions on Syria, the Iran nuclear deal, and the use of torture. Mattis criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for undermining Western democracies, while Trump praised Putin's leadership. Mattis also opposed Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members. His departure follows a series of high-profile exits in Trump's administration, reflecting a growing divide between Mattis's strategic approach and Trump's unilateral decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
