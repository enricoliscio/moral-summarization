Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis leaving the Trump administration, but I have to make sure to keep the moral framing words the author used. The user provided a list of those words: progress, sound, improving, reforming, greater, continue, provide, prevail, sustain, right, step, strengthen, actions, undercut, compromise, belief. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Mattis is retiring at the end of February. He was a key figure in Trump's defense policies, supporting increased military spending. He mentions the progress made in the National Defense Strategy, like budget stability, readiness, and reforms. He also had disagreements with Trump on Russia and China, and on issues like the Iran deal, transgender ban, and Syria withdrawal.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. So, I'll use words like "progress," "sound," "improving," etc. I should mention Mattis's achievements in a positive light, but also note the disagreements, using words like "undercut" and "compromise" to show the conflict.

I'll structure the summary to first state Mattis's departure, then his achievements, then the disagreements, and finally the implications. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise but include the moral framing.

I should also mention the budget increase and the key goals, using "sound," "improving," and "reforming." Then, when talking about the disagreements, use "undercut" and "compromise" to show the opposing views.

I'll make sure to include Mattis's reasons for stepping down, emphasizing that he wanted to align with Trump's views, using "right" and "step." Also, mention the Syria withdrawal and the Iran deal as points of contention, using "strength" and "undermine."

Finally, I'll wrap it up by noting the impact of his departure on the administration's image and policy direction, using "sustain" and "prevail."

I think that covers all the key points with the moral framing intact. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include the required words and keep it within the word limit.
