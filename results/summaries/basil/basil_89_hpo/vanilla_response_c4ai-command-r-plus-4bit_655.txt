SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will retire at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first cabinet picks and served over four decades in the military. His resignation letter cited differences with Trump on key issues such as Russia and China, with Mattis emphasizing the importance of treating allies with respect. Mattis' departure comes after Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a move that Mattis had advised against. The defense secretary had also disagreed with Trump on other issues, such as the Iran nuclear deal, transgender service members, and the use of torture. Nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," he oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Tom Price.
END OF SUMMARY.
