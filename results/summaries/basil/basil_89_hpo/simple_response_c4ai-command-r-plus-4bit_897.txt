SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's earliest Cabinet picks, would retire at the end of February. Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure. His resignation letter revealed differences with Trump on key issues, including their views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis had previously disagreed with Trump's decisions to withdraw troops from Syria, ban transgender service members, and use torture in interrogations. He also had differing opinions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis's departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson, Tom Price, Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer. His resignation highlights the moral dilemma of serving in an administration with differing values and the challenges of maintaining one's integrity while navigating political differences.

END OF SUMMARY.
