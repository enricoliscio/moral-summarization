SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," has announced his retirement, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general, has been a key figure in Trump's administration, echoing the president's call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness. However, their views diverged on Russia and China, with Mattis characterizing Putin as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies. Trump, on the other hand, has praised Putin's leadership skills and called for Russia's reinstatement to the Group of Seven. Mattis also opposed Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. His resignation comes amid reports of a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
