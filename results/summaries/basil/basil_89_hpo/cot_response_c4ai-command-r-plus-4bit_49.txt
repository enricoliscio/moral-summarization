SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of President Trump's first Cabinet picks, will retire at the end of February. Mattis had served over four decades in the military and headed the US Central Command from 2010 to 2013. His resignation letter revealed differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, with Mattis characterizing Putin as undermining NATO and assaulting Western democracies while violating international norms. Mattis also opposed Trump's controversial proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. Their relationship was marked by friction, with Mattis reportedly frustrated and displeased with Trump's controversial decision-making. The final straw came after Trump's controversial withdrawal of troops from Syria, which Mattis disagreed with due to concerns that it would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in the region. Mattis joins a growing list of controversial departures from the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.
