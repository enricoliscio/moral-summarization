SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will retire at the end of February, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday. Mattis, known for his commitment to strengthening the military and improving combat readiness, has made significant progress in putting the Department of Defense on a sound budgetary footing and reforming its business practices for greater performance. However, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, leading to Mattis' decision to step down. Mattis' resignation comes after Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed, citing concerns about strengthening the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis' departure marks a significant split between the two on issues like Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Iran nuclear deal, and transgender service members. Despite their differences, Mattis remains committed to sustaining strong U.S. global influence and prevailing in conflict. His resignation is a significant loss for the administration, which has seen a growing list of high-profile departures.
