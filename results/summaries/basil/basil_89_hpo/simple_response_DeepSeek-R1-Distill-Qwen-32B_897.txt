Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's resignation from Trump's administration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read through the article to get the main points.

The article starts by stating that Trump tweeted Mattis is retiring at the end of February. Mattis has been a key figure in the administration, supporting increased military spending. He's been with Trump since the beginning, and his departure is significant. The budget increase is a big point, so I should include that.

Then, the article mentions Mattis's resignation letter, where he talks about differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. That's a moral point because it's about how each leader views other countries' governance. Mattis felt his views weren't aligned with Trump's, which is a key reason for his departure.

The article also covers specific disagreements, like Trump pulling troops out of Syria against Mattis's advice. That's another moral angle because it's about national security and alliances. Mattis thought leaving would strengthen Russia and Iran, which are adversaries. So that's a conflict in strategy and values.

Another point is the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis wanted to stay in it, but Trump withdrew. That's a significant policy difference, showing a clash in foreign policy approaches. Mattis's opposition to Trump's policies on transgender service members and torture also highlights their differing values.

The summary should include the main reasons for Mattis's resignation: policy disagreements, especially on Russia, Syria, Iran, and military readiness. Also, mention the budget increase and Mattis's achievements in the Department of Defense.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral framing, which is the clash of values and strategies between Mattis and Trump. I'll structure it by highlighting the key points: Mattis's support for military spending, his departure due to disagreements on authoritarianism, specific policy conflicts, and the implications of his resignation on the administration's stability.

I should avoid going into too much detail on each point but ensure each major disagreement is mentioned. Also, note that Mattis's departure is part of a trend of high-profile exits, indicating a problematic administration dynamic.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by stating that Mattis's exit reflects fundamental disagreements on foreign policy and governance, emphasizing the moral and strategic divides.
