SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, is resigning from his position, effective February 28. Mattis, who was one of President Trump's first Cabinet picks, has differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. The resignation comes after Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which Mattis opposed, and amidst reports that the White House was discussing potential replacements. Mattis has been a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, characterizing him as trying to undermine NATO and Western democracies. In contrast, Trump has praised Putin's leadership skills. Mattis has also disagreed with Trump on the Iran nuclear deal and transgender service members. His resignation marks another high-profile departure from the Trump administration, following Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Tom Price, and others. Mattis' departure raises concerns about the administration's national security and foreign policy direction.
