SUMMARY: President Trump announced via tweet that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will retire at the end of February, despite earlier assurances that he was "very happy" with him. Mattis, a retired Marine general with over four decades of military service, had been a strong advocate for strengthening the military and improving its readiness. In his resignation letter, Mattis highlighted the progress made during his tenure, including budgetary improvements and increased lethality of US forces. However, he also acknowledged differing views with Trump, particularly regarding Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, and the decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Mattis has consistently demonstrated his commitment to ethical standards and international norms, opposing Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture. His departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the administration, including Rex Tillerson and Tom Price. Mattis' resignation underscores the ongoing challenges within the Trump administration and the difficulty in sustaining a cohesive team with strong, aligned moral values.
END OF SUMMARY.
