SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of President Trump's earliest Cabinet picks, will be retiring at the end of February, as announced by Trump on Thursday. Mattis had a distinguished military career spanning over four decades and oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure as Defense Secretary. However, his resignation letter revealed a moral divergence with Trump, particularly regarding their views on Russia and China. Mattis expressed concern over the authoritarianism of these countries, while Trump praised Russian President Putin's leadership and sought to reinstate Russia into the Group of Seven. Mattis also opposed Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. He faced ethical questions and was at odds with the President on several issues, including the withdrawal of troops from Syria and the targeted airstrikes against Syria, which Trump unilaterally ordered despite Mattis' recommendation for congressional approval. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who resigned amidst ethical controversies.
END OF SUMMARY.
