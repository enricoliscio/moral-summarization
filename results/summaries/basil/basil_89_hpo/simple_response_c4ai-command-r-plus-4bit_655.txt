SUMMARY: President Trump announced that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's first Cabinet picks, will retire in February due to differing views. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted their differences on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, with Mattis expressing concern about Putin's actions undermining NATO and Western democracies. Trump, however, praised Putin's leadership and called for Russia's reinstatement in the G7. Other differences included the approach towards Syria and Iran, with Mattis advocating for a continued U.S. presence in Syria and considering staying in the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis also opposed Trump's ban on transgender service members and the use of torture. The announcement comes after reports of their differing views and potential replacements. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration.
