Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mattis's resignation, his contributions, and his disagreements with Trump. The morally framed words include progress, sound, improving, reforming, etc.

I'll start by outlining the key events: Mattis's resignation, his achievements, his disagreements on Russia and China, Syria withdrawal, Iran deal, and other policy differences. I need to incorporate the moral terms naturally into the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Mattis's positive contributions using words like "progress," "sound," "improving," and "reforming." Then, mention his disagreements with Trump, using terms like "strengthen," "undercut," and "compromise."

I'll also include the budget increase and his support for military readiness. Make sure to mention the specific issues where they differed, like Syria, Iran, and the transgender ban.

Finally, I'll note Mattis's departure as part of a trend of high-profile exits in Trump's administration. I'll ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit, using the moral terms effectively to frame the narrative as the author intended.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will retire at the end of February. Mattis, who has served over four decades in the military, played a key role in strengthening the U.S. military and improving its combat readiness. He emphasized progress in achieving the National Defense Strategy’s goals, including sound budgetary practices, improving readiness, and reforming business practices for greater performance. However, Mattis noted differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, stating it was "right" for him to step down. Trump recently withdrew U.S. troops from Syria against Mattis’s advice, which he believed would strengthen Russia and Iran. Mattis also opposed Trump’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal, as well as the ban on transgender service members and the use of torture. Mattis’s resignation comes amid reports of potential replacements, though Trump denied seeking his departure. The split between Mattis and Trump highlights tensions over Russia’s role in undermining Western democracies and the administration’s policies. Mattis’s departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from Trump’s administration. END OF SUMMARY.
