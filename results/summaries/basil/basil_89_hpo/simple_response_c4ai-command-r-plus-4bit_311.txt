SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's initial Cabinet picks, would retire in February. Mattis' resignation letter revealed differences with Trump on key issues such as the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, approaches to Russia and China, and the Iran nuclear deal. Nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," he oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure. Mattis also disagreed with Trump on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. His departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Reince Priebus. Mattis' resignation highlights ethical and ideological differences with Trump, particularly regarding the role of the US in global affairs and respect for democratic ideals.
END OF SUMMARY.
