Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided specific steps: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using those words.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" means. It likely refers to words that carry a moral judgment or connotation, such as "strength," "readiness," "aligned," "undermine," etc. I should go through the article and pick out these words.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the main points: Mattis's resignation, his achievements, disagreements with Trump, and the implications of his departure.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and maintains the moral perspective presented in the original text. I'll need to condense the information, focusing on key events and the moral implications, like the budget increase, the split on Russia and China, and Mattis's opposition to certain policies.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing the moral words and then the SUMMARY section, making sure it's concise and within the word limit. I need to double-check that I haven't missed any important moral terms and that the summary accurately reflects the article's moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignation, effective February 28, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a key figure in Trump's administration, emphasized his achievements in strengthening the military, improving readiness, and reforming the Defense Department. However, his departure highlights a major split with Trump over issues like Russia's reinstatement in the G7, the Iran nuclear deal, and opposition to Trump's policies on transgender service members and torture. Mattis also clashed with Trump over Syria, where Trump withdrew troops despite Mattis' concerns about counterterrorism efforts. The resignation follows reports of potential replacements, including military leaders and politicians. Mattis' departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from Trump's administration, reflecting ongoing tensions and ethical concerns.
