SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's first Cabinet picks, would retire at the end of February. Mattis' resignation letter cited policy differences with Trump, particularly regarding Russia and China, with Mattis emphasizing the importance of treating allies with respect and maintaining a strong military posture. Mattis had previously disagreed with Trump on various issues, including the need for a continued U.S. presence in Syria, the Iran nuclear deal, and the ban on transgender service members. Nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," he oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure and worked to improve the military's readiness and lethality. His departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House Communications Director Hope Hicks. The news of Mattis' resignation has sparked discussions about potential replacements, with several names already being considered.
END OF SUMMARY.
