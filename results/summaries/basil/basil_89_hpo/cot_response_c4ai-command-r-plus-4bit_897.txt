SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump announced via Twitter the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's earliest Cabinet picks. Mattis' resignation letter, which highlighted his disagreement with Trump's views on Russia and China, indicated his last day would be February 28st. Mattis had a long and distinguished military career, serving over four decades and heading the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013. He oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure as Defense Secretary. 

Mattis' departure comes on the heels of Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a move Mattis opposed, citing concerns about the ongoing counterterrorism mission and regional stability. Additionally, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russia's Vladimir Putin, with Mattis criticizing Putin for undermining NATO and assaulting Western democracies, while Trump praised his leadership skills. Other points of contention included the Iran nuclear deal, the proposed ban on transgender service members, and the use of torture in interrogations, where Mattis was overruled by Trump. 

Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile resignations and firings from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson, Tom Price, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, and Hope Hicks, raising concerns about ethical shortfalls and a lack of stability within the administration.
