SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's first Cabinet picks, will retire in February. Mattis served over four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013. His resignation letter indicated differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Earlier, Mattis had opposed Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and had a differing stance on other issues, including the Iran nuclear deal and the use of torture. Nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," he oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Tom Price.
END OF SUMMARY.
