SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a respected military leader, has announced his resignation, citing differences with President Trump on key issues such as Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis' departure marks a significant loss for the administration, as he was a strong advocate for a robust military and a voice of reason in the cabinet. Despite Trump's claims of being "very happy" with Mattis, the defense secretary's resignation letter suggests that their differences were irreconcilable. Mattis' commitment to democratic values and international norms clashed with Trump's admiration for authoritarian leaders like Putin. The resignation also highlights the administration's pattern of high-profile departures, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others. Mattis' departure raises concerns about the stability and coherence of US foreign policy, particularly in the face of growing global threats.
