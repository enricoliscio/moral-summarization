Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis's resignation. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Trump tweeted about Mattis retiring at the end of February. Mattis has been in the military for over four decades and was confirmed as Defense Secretary in 2017. He supported Trump's call to strengthen the military and increase its budget, which went up by over 15% this year. Mattis's resignation letter mentions his pride in the progress made on the National Defense Strategy, like budget stability and improving troop readiness. However, he also notes that he and Trump have differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, which is why he's stepping down.

Earlier, Trump withdrew troops from Syria against Mattis's advice, which is a point of contention. Mattis thought a small presence was needed, but Trump pulled out anyway. There are also mentions of potential replacements for Mattis, with names like Jack Keane and Tom Cotton being discussed, though Trump denied looking for a replacement. The article also touches on other disagreements, like the Iran nuclear deal, Mattis's opposition to Trump's policies on transgender service members and torture, and Mattis's handling of airstrikes in Syria without seeking congressional approval, which Trump overruled.

Additionally, Mattis's tenure is part of a pattern of high-profile departures in Trump's administration, including Rex Tillerson, Tom Price, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, Hope Hicks, and Joe Hagin. The article also mentions a book by Bob Woodward where Mattis supposedly criticized Trump's understanding, but Mattis denied that.

So, to summarize, the key points are Mattis's resignation, his reasons (differing views on Russia and China), the military budget increase, disagreements on Syria, potential replacements, other policy disagreements, and the pattern of departures in the administration.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the main events and reasons for his resignation, the implications, and the context of other administration changes. I'll make sure to mention the budget, the Syria withdrawal, the differing views, and the notable departures.

Let me structure it: start with Mattis's resignation, his tenure, the budget, his reasons for leaving, disagreements on Syria, mention potential replacements and Trump's denial, other policy disagreements, and the broader context of administration changes. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
