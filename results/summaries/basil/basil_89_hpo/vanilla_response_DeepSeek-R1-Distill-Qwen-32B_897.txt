Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis's resignation. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points. 

First, the article mentions that President Trump tweeted that Mattis is retiring at the end of February. Mattis has been a significant figure in Trump's administration, especially since he was one of the first Cabinet picks. He's a retired Marine general with a long military career. 

The article also notes that Mattis supported Trump's call to strengthen the military and increase defense spending. The budget for the Defense Department was increased by over 15%, which is the largest hike since 2002. Mattis's resignation letter highlights the progress made in the National Defense Strategy, like improving readiness and reforming business practices. 

However, there were disagreements between Mattis and Trump, particularly regarding Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, the withdrawal of troops from Syria, and the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis opposed Trump's decisions on these issues, which seems to have contributed to his resignation. 

Additionally, Mattis had differing views on other matters like the transgender ban and the use of torture in interrogations. His public disagreements with Trump, such as over the airstrikes in Syria, also played a role. 

The article also mentions that Mattis's departure is part of a trend of high-profile exits from Trump's administration, including Rex Tillerson and others. 

I need to condense all this information into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the main points: Mattis's resignation, his achievements, disagreements with Trump, and the broader context of administration changes. I should ensure clarity and conciseness, highlighting the key reasons for his departure and the implications for the administration.
