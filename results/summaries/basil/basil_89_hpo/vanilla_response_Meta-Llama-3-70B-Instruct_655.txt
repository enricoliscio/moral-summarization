SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will be retiring at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks and has served as defense secretary since January 2017. In his resignation letter, Mattis cited differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism as the reason for his departure. The two had disagreed on several issues, including the withdrawal of US troops from Syria and the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis had also opposed Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. His departure comes amid reports that the White House had been discussing potential replacements, including several high-ranking military officials and politicians. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration.
