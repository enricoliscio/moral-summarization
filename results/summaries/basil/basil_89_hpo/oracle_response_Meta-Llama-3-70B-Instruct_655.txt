SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will be retiring at the end of February, as announced by President Donald Trump. Mattis, who served for over four decades in the military, had differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the "progress" made in strengthening the military and improving its combat readiness. He also highlighted the need to "reform" the Department's business practices for "greater" performance. However, Mattis and Trump disagreed on key issues, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, which Mattis believed would "strengthen" the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis also characterized Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions as trying to "undercut" and "compromise" Western democracies. Trump, on the other hand, has praised Putin's leadership skills. Mattis' departure marks another high-profile exit from the Trump administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
