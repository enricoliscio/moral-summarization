Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The article is about Jim Mattis's resignation as Defense Secretary under Trump. 

First, Mattis was a respected military leader, known as "Mad Dog Mattis." He was one of Trump's first cabinet picks. He supported Trump's military strengthening policies and the increased defense budget. However, there were disagreements on foreign policy, especially regarding Russia and China. Mattis saw them as authoritarian threats, while Trump was more favorable.

Mattis also opposed Trump on issues like the Iran nuclear deal, transgender military ban, and the use of torture. Their biggest split was over Syria, where Trump withdrew troops against Mattis's advice. Mattis's resignation letter mentions differing views on authoritarianism, which is a moral point about the administration's approach to international relations.

I should highlight the contrast between Mattis's military expertise and Trump's leadership style. Also, note the implications of Mattis's departure on the administration's credibility and policy continuity. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral aspects are clear. The summary should show Mattis's support for military strength but opposition to Trump's policies, leading to his resignation. It's important to mention the key disagreements and the impact on the administration.

Let me structure it: start with Mattis's resignation, his support for military policies, then the disagreements on foreign policy, and the implications. Make sure to include the moral framing around authoritarianism and policy decisions.
