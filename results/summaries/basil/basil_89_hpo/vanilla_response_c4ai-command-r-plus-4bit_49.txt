SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will retire at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first cabinet picks and oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure. His resignation letter cited policy differences with Trump, particularly regarding Russia and China. Mattis had previously clashed with Trump on various issues, including the decision to withdraw troops from Syria, the Iran nuclear deal, and the proposed ban on transgender service members. Mattis' departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson, Tom Price, Reince Priebus, and Hope Hicks.
END OF SUMMARY.
