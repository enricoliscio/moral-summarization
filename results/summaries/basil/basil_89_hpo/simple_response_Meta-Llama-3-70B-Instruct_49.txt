SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has announced his resignation, effective February 28, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general, had been a key figure in Trump's administration, supporting the president's call for a stronger military and increased combat readiness. However, Mattis had disagreed with Trump on several issues, including the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, which Mattis believed would strengthen Russia and Iran's influence in the region. Mattis also had concerns about Trump's praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Mattis saw as a threat to NATO and Western democracies. The resignation comes amid reports of a growing divide between Mattis and Trump, with Mattis being the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the administration.
