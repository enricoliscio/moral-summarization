Alright, I need to summarize this article about Mattis's resignation. Let me read through the article first. It starts with Trump tweeting that Mattis is retiring at the end of February. Mattis has been a key figure in Trump's administration, especially with the defense budget and military reforms.

I should note the main points: Mattis's resignation, his tenure, the defense budget increase, his disagreements with Trump on Russia and China, and his opposition to Trump's policies like the Syria withdrawal and the transgender ban. Also, the mention of potential successors and other high-profile departures from the administration are important.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mattis's resignation, his role, the budget, and key achievements. Then, I'll mention his disagreements with Trump on Russia and China, the Syria withdrawal, and other policies. Finally, I'll touch on the possible replacements and other departures to give context about the administration's changes.

I should make sure to include the main reasons for his resignation, like differing views on authoritarianism, and his stance on military readiness. Also, the fact that Trump denied planning his replacement adds context.

Let me structure this clearly, ensuring each point flows logically. I'll avoid getting too detailed on each point to stay within the word limit.
