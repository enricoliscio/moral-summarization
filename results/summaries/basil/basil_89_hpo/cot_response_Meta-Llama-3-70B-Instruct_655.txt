SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," has announced his resignation, effective February 28. In his letter, Mattis expressed pride in the progress made towards strengthening the military and improving readiness. However, he and President Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, leading to his decision to step down. Mattis had previously opposed Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, citing concerns that it would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis also disagreed with Trump on Russian President Vladimir Putin, characterizing him as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies. Trump, on the other hand, has praised Putin's leadership skills. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration, citing differing views on key issues. END OF SUMMARY.
