SUMMARY: In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of his earliest Cabinet picks, would be stepping down at the end of February. Mattis' resignation comes on the heels of several key disagreements with Trump, including the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and differing views on how to handle Russia and China. Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure and worked to improve the readiness and lethality of U.S. forces. However, his moral compass and commitment to international alliances clashed with Trump's unilateral decisions and praise for authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted their differing views, stating that Trump had a right to a Defense Secretary whose views aligned more closely with his own. This departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, raising concerns about the President's ability to work with those who hold differing opinions and the moral implications of his leadership style. 

END OF SUMMARY.
