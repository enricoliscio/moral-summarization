SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced via tweet that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of Trump's earliest Cabinet picks, would be retiring at the end of February. Mattis, known as "Mad Dog Mattis" during his military career, oversaw a significant increase in military spending and worked to improve readiness and lethality in the armed forces. In his resignation letter, Mattis highlighted his pride in the progress made during his tenure, including budgetary improvements and enhanced performance through business reforms. Mattis' departure comes after a series of disagreements with Trump, including their differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, the withdrawal of troops from Syria, and the handling of international relations with Russia and Iran. Mattis has also opposed Trump on issues such as the transgender military ban and the use of torture. The defense secretary's resignation adds to a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Tom Price. Mattis' strong moral compass and commitment to progress, improvement, and sustainability in the military sphere are evident in his actions and words.
END OF SUMMARY.
