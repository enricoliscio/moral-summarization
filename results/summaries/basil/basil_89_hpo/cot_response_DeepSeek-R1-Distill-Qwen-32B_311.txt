Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. These are words that carry a moral judgment or implication, either positive or negative. So, I should look for words like "pride," "strength," "undermining," "wrongdoing," etc., that indicate a value judgment.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each paragraph and pick out these words. For example, "proud" is a positive moral word, "strength" is positive, "undermining" is negative. I'll list each of these, each on a new line starting with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the key points: Mattis's resignation, his achievements, disagreements with Trump, and the implications of his departure.

I should ensure that the summary flows naturally and includes the moral aspects without making it too long. I'll start by mentioning Mattis's resignation, his contributions, the disagreements on policy, and the impact on the administration's image.

I also need to make sure that the summary is accurate and doesn't add any information not present in the article. It should reflect the moral framing by using the identified words where appropriate.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing the words and then the SUMMARY, making sure to end with the required tokens. I'll double-check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

Alright, I think I have a clear plan. Let me start by reading through the article again to pick out those morally framed words and then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignation, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis expressed pride in strengthening the military and improving readiness but emphasized the need for alignment with Trump’s vision. Trump recently withdrew U.S. troops from Syria against Mattis’s advice, sparking concerns about regional instability. Mattis also opposed Trump’s policies on transgender service members, torture, and the Iran nuclear deal. His departure follows a series of high-profile exits from Trump’s administration, highlighting growing internal divisions. Mattis’s legacy includes advocating for military reform and opposing Trump’s praise for Russian President Putin. His resignation underscores tensions between traditional military values and the administration’s foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
