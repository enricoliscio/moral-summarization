Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main focus is on Mattis's resignation, his contributions, and his disagreements with Trump.

I notice the article uses specific morally framed words like "progress," "sound," "improving," etc. My goal is to include as many of these as possible in the summary without losing the essence. I should highlight Mattis's achievements, such as the budget increase and reforms, and contrast them with his disagreements on Russia, China, Syria, and the Iran deal.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating Mattis's resignation, then his accomplishments, followed by the areas of disagreement with Trump. I'll also mention his opposition to certain policies like the transgender ban and torture. Finally, I'll note his departure as part of a trend in the administration.

I must ensure the moral framing is maintained by using the specified words. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, known as "Mad Dog Mattis," announced his resignation, effective February 28, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was a key figure in Trump's administration, supporting military strengthening and reform. He highlighted progress in budgetary stability, readiness, and lethality of U.S. forces, as well as efforts to sustain global influence. However, Mattis opposed Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, arguing it would strengthen Russia and Iran. He also disagreed with Trump's praise of Russian President Putin and the decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis criticized Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. His departure follows a series of high-profile exits in Trump's administration, reflecting a growing divide between Mattis's commitment to sound defense strategies and Trump's policies. END OF SUMMARY.
