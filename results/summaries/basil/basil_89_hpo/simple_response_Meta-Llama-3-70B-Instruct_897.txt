SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is resigning from his position, effective February 28, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general, had been a key figure in Trump's administration, supporting the president's call for a stronger military and increased combat readiness. However, the two had significant disagreements, including Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which Mattis believed would strengthen Russia and Iran's influence in the region. Mattis also differed with Trump on Russian President Vladimir Putin, characterizing him as a threat to NATO and Western democracies, while Trump has praised Putin's leadership skills. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted the progress made in strengthening the military, but also emphasized the importance of having a Secretary of Defense whose views align with the president's.
