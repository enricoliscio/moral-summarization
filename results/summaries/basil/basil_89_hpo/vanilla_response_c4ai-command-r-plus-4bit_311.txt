SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will retire at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks and had served in the military for over four decades. His resignation letter highlighted his achievements in improving the budgetary footing, readiness, and lethality of the US military. However, Mattis also indicated that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, citing that Trump had "the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned" with his own. The announcement comes after Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which went against Mattis' advice. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson, Tom Price, Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer. Trump has denied looking to replace Mattis, despite reports to the contrary. Mattis has had several notable disagreements with Trump during his tenure, including on issues related to Russia, the Iran nuclear deal, transgender service members, and torture.
END OF SUMMARY.
