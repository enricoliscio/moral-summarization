SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will be retiring at the end of February, as announced by President Donald Trump on Twitter. Mattis, who served over four decades in the military, was a key Cabinet pick and echoed Trump's call for strengthening the military and improving its combat readiness. During his tenure, Mattis made progress on key goals, including putting the Department on a sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in forces, and reforming business practices for greater performance. However, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, leading to Mattis' decision to step down. Mattis' resignation letter highlighted the importance of sustaining strong U.S. global influence and prevailing in conflict. His departure comes after Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed, citing concerns that it would strengthen Russia and Iran's hand in the region. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
