SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has announced his retirement, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general, had been a strong advocate for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness. However, he had concerns about Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which Mattis believed would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis also opposed Trump's proposed ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. The defense secretary's resignation letter highlighted the progress made on key goals, including putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing and improving readiness and lethality in forces. Mattis' departure adds to the growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration. END OF SUMMARY.
