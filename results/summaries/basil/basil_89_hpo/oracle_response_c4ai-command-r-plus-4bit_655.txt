SUMMARY: President Trump announced via Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would be retiring at the end of February, despite earlier claims that he was "very happy" with him. Mattis, a retired Marine General with over four decades of military service, had been a strong advocate for strengthening the military and improving its readiness. In his resignation letter, Mattis highlighted the progress made under his tenure, including budgetary improvements and increased lethality. However, he also acknowledged differing views with Trump on key issues, such as the withdrawal of troops from Syria and the approach to Russia and China's authoritarian regimes. Mattis' departure follows a series of high-profile exits from the Trump administration and underscores the ongoing challenges in maintaining stability and sustaining strong global influence. Mattis' resignation is a significant loss, as he was widely respected for his commitment to reforming and improving the Defense Department's performance and capabilities. His departure raises concerns about the future direction of U.S. defense policy and the potential for further discord within the administration. 

END OF SUMMARY.
