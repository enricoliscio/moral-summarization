SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will be retiring at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks and has served as defense secretary since January 2017. In his resignation letter, Mattis cited differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, and stated that he believes it is right for him to step down. The news comes after Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed. Mattis has also disagreed with Trump on issues such as the Iran nuclear deal and transgender service members. He joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Mattis' final day in office will be February 28.
