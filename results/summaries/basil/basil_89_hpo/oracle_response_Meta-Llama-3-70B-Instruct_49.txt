SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, will retire at the end of February, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday. Mattis, who served over four decades in the military, has made significant progress in strengthening the military and improving its combat readiness. In his resignation letter, Mattis highlighted the progress made in putting the Department on a sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in forces, and reforming business practices for greater performance. However, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, with Mattis believing it is right to step down from his position. Mattis' departure comes after Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed, citing concerns that it would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis' resignation is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the administration, with many Republicans expressing concern over the actions of the President. END OF SUMMARY.
