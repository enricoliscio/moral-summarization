SUMMARY:  
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, announced his resignation, effective February 28, after serving as Trump's Cabinet member. Mattis praised the progress made in strengthening the military, improving readiness, and reforming the Department of Defense. He emphasized the need to sustain U.S. global influence and ensure troops continue to provide the capabilities to prevail in conflicts. However, Mattis noted differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, stating it was right for him to step down. Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria despite Mattis's concerns highlighted their growing divide. Mattis also opposed Trump's policies on transgender service members, torture, and the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from. Mattis's departure follows a series of high-profile exits in Trump's administration, underscoring a broader challenge to the administration's cohesion. His resignation reflects a split over key issues, including Putin's actions, which Mattis viewed as undercutting Western ideals, while Trump praised Putin's leadership. Mattis's tenure was marked by efforts to strengthen the military and reform its practices, but his departure leaves questions about the administration's direction. END OF SUMMARY.
