Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis's resignation from the Trump administration. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points without adding my own opinions.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Mattis is resigning, and Trump is replacing him. The article mentions their differing views on Russia and China, military spending, Syria withdrawal, Iran deal, and transgender ban. Also, Mattis's support for military strength and his criticism of Trump's policies.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like Mattis's concerns about authoritarianism and the impact of policies on U.S. influence. I should mention the key disagreements and how they reflect on Trump's leadership. Also, include the context of other departures in the administration to show instability.

I'll structure the summary to start with Mattis's resignation, his accomplishments, their disagreements, and the implications of his departure. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral framing.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these points without getting too detailed. I'll end with the token as instructed.
