SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general and one of President Trump's first Cabinet picks, announced his resignation, citing differing views with the President on key issues such as Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis," oversaw a significant increase in military spending during his tenure and worked to improve readiness and lethality in the U.S. forces. He also disagreed with Trump on other issues, such as the ban on transgender service members and the use of torture in interrogations. Mattis' resignation letter emphasized his belief in the importance of strengthening U.S. global influence and his commitment to reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. His departure comes after reports of growing tensions between him and Trump, including their differing views on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and how to handle Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mattis' resignation adds to a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Tom Price.
