SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, is retiring at the end of February, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, known for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness, wrote in his resignation letter that he is "proud" of the progress made on key goals, including putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing and improving readiness and lethality in forces. However, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, with Mattis characterizing Putin as trying to "undermine" NATO and "assaulting" Western democracies. Trump, on the other hand, has praised Putin's "leadership" skills. Mattis' departure adds to a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
