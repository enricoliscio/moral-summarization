SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis", will retire at the end of February, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, a retired Marine general, had served over four decades in the military and was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks. In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote that he was "proud" of the progress made on key goals, including strengthening the military and improving readiness. However, Mattis and Trump had differing views on Russia and China, with Mattis characterizing Putin as trying to "undermine" NATO and "assaulting" Western democracies. Trump, on the other hand, has praised Putin's leadership skills. Mattis also opposed Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, citing concerns that it would "strengthen" the hand of Russia and Iran. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
