SUMMARY: President Donald Trump announced that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, nicknamed "Mad Dog Mattis", will retire at the end of February, after more than four decades of military service. Mattis oversaw a significant increase in military spending and worked to improve readiness and lethality in U.S. forces. His resignation letter highlighted his commitment to progress and reform, and he expressed pride in the troops' ability to prevail in conflict and sustain U.S. global influence. However, Mattis also acknowledged his differing views with Trump on key issues, such as the withdrawal of troops from Syria and the approach to Russia and China. Mattis has consistently stood for moral principles, opposing the use of torture, advocating for transgender service members, and emphasizing the importance of seeking congressional approval for military strikes. His departure adds to a growing list of high-profile exits from the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Tom Price. Mattis' resignation underscores the importance of upholding moral principles and the challenges faced by those who seek to do so within the administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
