SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will be retiring at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, has served as defense secretary since January 2017. In his resignation letter, Mattis cited differences with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, stating that he believes it's right for him to step down. The news comes after Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which Mattis had opposed. Mattis has also disagreed with Trump on issues such as the Iran nuclear deal and transgender service members. He joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House Communications Director Hope Hicks. Mattis' final day in office will be February 28.
