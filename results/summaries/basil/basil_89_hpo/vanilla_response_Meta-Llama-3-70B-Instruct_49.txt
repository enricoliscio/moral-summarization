SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will be retiring at the end of February. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks and has served as defense secretary since January 2017. In his resignation letter, Mattis cited differences with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, and noted that he is proud of the progress made in strengthening the military and improving readiness. Mattis had previously disagreed with Trump on issues such as withdrawing troops from Syria and the Iran nuclear deal. The news of Mattis' departure comes after reports that the White House had been discussing potential replacements, including several high-ranking military officials and politicians. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration.
