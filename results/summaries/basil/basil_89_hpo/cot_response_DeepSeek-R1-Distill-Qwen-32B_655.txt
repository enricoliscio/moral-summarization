Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure, so I should follow that.

First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "strength," "readiness," "reform," "sound," "integrity," "understanding," "undermine," "compromise," "ideals," "poorly," "opposed," "torture," "ethics," "short tenure," "questioned," "loyalty," "duties," "integrity," and "values" seem to fit.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. I should mention Mattis's achievements, his disagreements with Trump, and the implications of his departure. I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the moral aspects highlighted in the article.

I should start by noting Mattis's resignation and his accomplishments, then move on to the disagreements, especially regarding Russia, China, Syria, and the Iran deal. I'll also touch on the broader implications of his departure and the administration's instability.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward, ensuring that the moral framing is evident throughout.

**SUMMARY:**  
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignation, citing differing views with President Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism. Mattis, known for his strong military background, emphasized progress in strengthening the military, improving readiness, and reforming the Department of Defense. However, his departure highlights a significant split with Trump, particularly over Trump's praise of Russian President Putin and withdrawal of troops from Syria against Mattis' advice. Mattis also opposed Trump's decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal and his proposed ban on transgender service members. The resignation underscores the administration's instability, with Mattis joining a list of high-profile departures. His exit reflects tensions over foreign policy, military strategy, and ethical considerations, leaving questions about the future of U.S. global influence and military integrity.
