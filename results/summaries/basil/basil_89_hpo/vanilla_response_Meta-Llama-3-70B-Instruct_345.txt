SUMMARY:

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will retire at the end of February, as announced by President Donald Trump on Twitter. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was one of Trump's first Cabinet picks and served as defense secretary since January 2017. In his resignation letter, Mattis cited differing views with Trump on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, and stated that he believes it is right for him to step down. Mattis had previously disagreed with Trump on several issues, including the withdrawal of US troops from Syria and the Iran nuclear deal. The news of Mattis' departure comes amid reports of potential replacements, including four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane and Sen. Tom Cotton. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the Trump administration.
