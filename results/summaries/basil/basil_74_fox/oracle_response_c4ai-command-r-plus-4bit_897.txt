SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin admitted that she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, in which she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. The image, which was first published by TMZ, was widely criticized on Twitter as "disturbing," "vile," and "wrong." Even Chelsea Clinton weighed in, calling it "vile and wrong." Griffin apologized, acknowledging that the image was "too disturbing" and "wasn't funny." She also took down the image, recognizing that it offended people and that she had "made a lot of mistakes." Shields, known for his controversial work, defended the image as art, invoking freedom of speech and artistic expression. He acknowledged that some people would hate the image but compared it to a movie scene, claiming it was "no different." However, this is not the first time Shields' work has caused uproar and resulted in threats, with some accusing him of making light of domestic abuse. Despite the backlash, Shields stands by the collaboration with Griffin, stating that he loves the idea of freedom of speech and that "nobody's killed me for this image so it's not that bad."
END OF SUMMARY.
