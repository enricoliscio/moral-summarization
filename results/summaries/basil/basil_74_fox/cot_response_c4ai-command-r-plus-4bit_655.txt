SUMMARY:
Kathy Griffin admitted that she "went too far" and apologized for participating in a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields, in which she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. The image, first published by TMZ, caused an uproar on Twitter, with people expressing their disdain and Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile and wrong." Shields, known for his shocking pictures, explained that the photo was intended as a bold political statement and a form of art. He defended their freedom of speech and the power of art to make people uncomfortable, but also acknowledged that it was disturbing and could be interpreted as offensive. Griffin took down the image and recognized her mistake, stating that she understood how it offended people. Despite the backlash, Shields did not express regret for the collaboration, noting that he loved the idea of stirring the pot with a powerful message. He also shared a behind-the-scenes video of the shoot, which was later removed due to technical glitches. This incident adds to Shields' history of creating controversial and upsetting images, including a previous photo that received death threats for appearing to make light of domestic abuse.
