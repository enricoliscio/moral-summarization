Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words: went, disturbing, funny, wrong, vile, threats, abuse, freedom, allowed. I have to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields, which included a bloodied Trump mask. She admitted it went too far and was disturbing, not funny, and wrong. Chelsea Clinton called it vile. Shields defended it as art, saying it's meant to make people uncomfortable, like in movies. He mentioned it's not real and doesn't promote violence. He also talked about freedom of speech and not facing death threats, unlike a previous photo with Heather Morris that was criticized for trivializing abuse.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with Griffin admitting she went too far, the image being disturbing and wrong. Mention Chelsea Clinton's reaction as vile. Then Shields' defense, using freedom and allowed. Also, reference the previous photo with Heather Morris and the threats. Keep it under 200 words and include all the moral words.

I should make sure the summary flows well, connecting each point without being too wordy. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloodied mask of President Trump, calling the image "disturbing" and "wrong." She acknowledged it wasn't "funny" and apologized for offending people. Chelsea Clinton condemned the photo as "vile and wrong." Photographer Tyler Shields defended the artwork, stating it was meant to provoke thought and that "some people love it, some hate it." He emphasized it was not real and likened it to a movie still. Shields, who previously faced death threats over a photo of Heather Morris that critics said trivialized domestic abuse, defended his work as an exercise of "freedom of speech." He expressed no regret for collaborating with Griffin, noting he was "allowed" to create such images without fear of harm. END OF SUMMARY.
