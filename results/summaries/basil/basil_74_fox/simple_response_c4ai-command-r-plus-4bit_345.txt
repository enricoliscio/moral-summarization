SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin and photographer Tyler Shields have sparked outrage and moral condemnation for a photo in which Griffin holds a bloodied mask of President Trump. While Griffin initially joked about the photo, she later apologized, admitting that she "went too far" and that the image was "too disturbing." Chelsea Clinton and others denounced the image as "vile and wrong," highlighting the moral implications of depicting violence against the President. Despite Shields' defense of the image as artistic expression and freedom of speech, the photo has caused widespread offense and backlash. Shields' past work has also faced criticism for seemingly making light of domestic abuse. Griffin's apology acknowledges the moral line that was crossed and the potential harm caused by such disturbing and violent imagery.

END OF SUMMARY.
