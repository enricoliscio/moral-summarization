Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her photo shoot with Tyler Shields. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, the article mentions that Kathy Griffin admitted she went too far with a photo where she's holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. The photo was taken by Tyler Shields, known for his controversial work. Griffin later tweeted that the image was too disturbing and not funny, apologizing for offending people. She also mentioned making mistakes in her career and planned to take down the image.

There's also some context about the photo session. Griffin joked with Shields about moving to Mexico to avoid imprisonment after the photos were released. Chelsea Clinton criticized the photo as "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image, saying it was art meant to make a bold political statement. He compared it to movies, emphasizing it's not real and no one was harmed. He also mentioned that some people love art, others hate it, and that's part of its purpose.

Additionally, Shields has a history of controversial photos, like one with Heather Morris that was criticized for trivializing domestic abuse. He doesn't regret working with Griffin, highlighting freedom of speech and hoping to visit her in Guantanamo humorously.

So, the key points to include in the summary are:
- Griffin's photo with a bloodied Trump mask.
- Her admission that it went too far and was offensive.
- Her plan to remove the image.
- Shields' defense of the art and its purpose.
- The comparison to movies and it being non-real.
- Chelsea Clinton's criticism.
- Shields' history with controversial photos.
- His stance on freedom of speech.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers these points clearly. I should avoid unnecessary details and focus on the main events and reactions.
