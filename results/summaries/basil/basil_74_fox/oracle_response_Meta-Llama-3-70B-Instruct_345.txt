SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with Tyler Shields, where she is holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. The "disturbing" image sparked outrage, with many calling it "vile and wrong". Griffin acknowledged her mistake, saying the image "isn't funny" and that she "understands how it offends people". She has since taken down the image, admitting she was "wrong". Shields, the photographer, defended the shoot, saying it was meant to be a bold statement and that "art is meant to do" - make people uncomfortable. However, this is not the first time Shields' work has caused controversy, having previously received "death threats" over a photo that made light of "domestic abuse". Shields stands by his work, citing "freedom of speech" and the fact that he is "allowed" to create such images. END OF SUMMARY.
