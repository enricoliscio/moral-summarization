SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin and photographer Tyler Shields have sparked outrage and moral condemnation for their recent photo shoot involving a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin has since apologized, admitting she "went too far" and that the image was "too disturbing." Despite their intentions to make a bold political statement, the photo was widely criticized as vile and offensive. Chelsea Clinton denounced it as "wrong," and people on Twitter expressed their moral outrage. Shields defended their freedom of speech and artistic expression, comparing the image to a movie scene, but acknowledged that it might make people uncomfortable. He has faced similar backlash in the past for his provocative images, including a photo that appeared to make light of domestic abuse. Griffin's apology acknowledges the moral boundaries that were crossed, and her recognition of the potential consequences, including possible imprisonment, underscores the severity of the moral infraction in the eyes of the public. 

END OF SUMMARY.
