Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo with Tyler Shields. They provided the article, so I need to read through it carefully to extract the key points. 

First, I notice that Kathy Griffin admitted she went too far with the photo where she's holding a bloodied Trump mask. She called it too disturbing and apologized. That's a main point. I should include her statement and her admission of mistakes.

Next, the article mentions that the photo was taken by Tyler Shields, known for shocking images. It's important to note his role and his explanation that the photo was meant as art, even though it's disturbing. Also, he compared it to a movie still, which is a good point to include about the artistic intent.

There's some context about the reaction: people on Twitter, including Chelsea Clinton, criticized it. I should mention the public backlash and the fact that Griffin's reps didn't respond immediately.

Additionally, Shields has a history of controversial photos, like the one with Heather Morris. This shows that this isn't the first time his work has caused issues. Including this adds depth to the summary.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Griffin's apology, the nature of the photo, Shields' artistic intent, the public reaction, and Shields' past controversies. I'll structure it concisely, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the user's instructions. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.
