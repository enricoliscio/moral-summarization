SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, in which she holds a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin tweeted that the image was "too disturbing" and "it wasn't funny," adding that she understands why it offends people. She also announced that she would be taking down the image. The photo sparked outrage on social media, with Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image, saying it was meant to be a bold statement and a form of art, and that it was not meant to be taken literally. He also stated that he doesn't regret the collaboration and believes in the importance of freedom of speech. This is not the first time Shields' photos have caused controversy, as he previously received death threats over a photo of "Glee" actress Heather Morris with bruises on her face.
