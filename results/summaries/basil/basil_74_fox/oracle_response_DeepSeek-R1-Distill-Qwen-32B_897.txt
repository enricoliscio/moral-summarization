Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Kathy Griffin's photo shoot controversy. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used specific morally charged words like "went too far," "disturbing," "funny," "wrong," "vile," "threats," "abuse," "freedom," and "allowed." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Kathy Griffin admitted she went too far with a photo where she's holding a bloodied Trump mask. She found it too disturbing and not funny, apologized, and took down the image. There was a lot of public backlash, including Chelsea Clinton calling it vile. The photographer, Tyler Shields, defended the art, saying it's meant to stir emotions and that it's just like a movie scene. He's had similar controversies before, like with Heather Morris, and doesn't regret working with Griffin.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Griffin admitted going too far, mention the photo and her reasons for taking it down. Include her apology and the public reaction, using "vile." Then explain Shields' defense, emphasizing freedom of speech and that it's just art, not real. Also, mention his past controversies. Make sure to include all the moral words listed.

I should structure it so each sentence flows logically, starting with Griffin's admission, her reasoning, public reaction, Shields' defense, and his past. I'll need to keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. Let me draft that and check the word count.

She apologized, stating it was "wrong" and offensive, and removed the photo. Public backlash included Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile." Photographer Tyler Shields defended the art, saying it aimed to stir emotions and was no different from a movie scene.

He emphasized freedom of speech, stating he wasn't killed for the image and defended Griffin's right to "stir the pot." END OF SUMMARY.
