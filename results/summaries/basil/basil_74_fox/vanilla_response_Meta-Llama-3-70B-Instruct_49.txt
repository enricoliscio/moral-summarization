SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, where she is seen holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin admitted on Twitter that the image was "too disturbing" and that she "went too far." She stated that she understands how the image offends people and that she has made mistakes in her career. The photo was met with widespread criticism, with Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image, saying it was meant to be a bold statement and that it's a form of art meant to evoke a reaction. He also clarified that the image was not meant to be taken literally and that no one was harmed in its creation. Griffin has since taken down the image, while Shields remains unapologetic about the collaboration.
