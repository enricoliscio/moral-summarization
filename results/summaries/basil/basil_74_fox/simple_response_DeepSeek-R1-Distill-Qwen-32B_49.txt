Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her photo shoot with Tyler Shields. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points and the ethical implications.

First, the article talks about Kathy Griffin holding a bloodied Trump mask. She later apologized, saying it was too disturbing and not funny. That's an important point because it shows her regret and the reaction from the public.

Tyler Shields defended the photo as art, saying it's meant to provoke and that it's not real. He's had issues before with similar photos, like the Heather Morris one, which was criticized for trivializing domestic abuse. So, his history adds context to why this photo is controversial.

Chelsea Clinton called it "vile and wrong," which shows the strong negative reaction. Griffin's team didn't respond immediately, but Shields stood by the art aspect. He also mentioned freedom of speech, which is a moral argument for his work.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the moral elements, like Griffin's apology, Shields' defense of art, the public's strong reaction, and the comparison to his past work. Also, include that the video was removed and re-uploaded due to glitches.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight Griffin's admission, the nature of the photo, the public and political reactions, Shields' perspective, and the broader implications of their work. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Griffin's statement, then Shields' defense, public reaction, and the context of his past controversies.

Public reaction was strongly negative, with Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the photo as art, emphasizing its provocative nature and denying any real harm, comparing it to a movie still.
