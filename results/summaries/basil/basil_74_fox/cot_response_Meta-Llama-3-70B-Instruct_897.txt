SUMMARY:
Comedian Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, where she is holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin admitted she "went too far" and that the image "is too disturbing" and "wasn't funny." She understood how it "offends people" and acknowledged making "mistakes" in her career. Many, including Chelsea Clinton, expressed disdain for the photo, calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image as art meant to make a bold statement, saying it's not meant to be taken literally and that he's aware it could make some viewers "uncomfortable." Despite the backlash, Shields doesn't regret the collaboration, citing freedom of speech. Griffin has since taken down the image, saying she was "wrong" to post it. END OF SUMMARY.
