Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her photo shoot with Tyler Shields. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I capture all the key points.

First, Kathy Griffin admitted she went too far with the photo where she's holding a bloodied Trump mask. She called it disturbing and not funny, understanding it offends people. She's apologized and said she'll take down the image. People on Twitter, including Chelsea Clinton, were upset, calling it vile and wrong. Shields defended the photo as art meant to make a statement, saying it's not real and shouldn't be taken literally. He also mentioned it's about freedom of speech and that no one was harmed. He's had issues before with controversial photos, like the Heather Morris one, which was criticized for trivializing abuse. He doesn't regret working with Griffin.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: went, disturbing, funny, wrong, vile, threats, abuse, freedom, allowed. Let me make sure each is included where appropriate. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it to flow logically. I'll start with Griffin's admission, her explanation, public reactions, Shields' defense, and mention his past controversies. I should end with his stance on freedom of speech.

I think that covers all the necessary points and includes the moral terms. Let me put it together clearly and concisely.
