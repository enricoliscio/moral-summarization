Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the task.

The user provided a news article about Kathy Griffin and Tyler Shields. They want me to do two things: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "controversial," "offends," "wrong," "vile," "distasteful," "stir the pot," and "freedom of speech" stand out. These words reflect judgments or moral evaluations.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include these morally framed words. I'll focus on the key points: Griffin admitting she went too far, the reaction from Chelsea Clinton, Shields' defense of the artwork, and the broader implications of free speech.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Griffin's admission, then the reactions, Shields' explanation, and ending with the debate over free speech. I need to ensure that the summary is concise and captures the essence of the article while keeping the moral language intact.

I also need to make sure that the summary doesn't include any markdown or special formatting, just plain text. I'll start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." to comply with the user's instructions.

Double-checking the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll read through the summary to make sure it's clear and all the important points are covered without unnecessary details.

* Distasteful  
* Stir the pot  
* Freedom of speech  

**SUMMARY:**  
Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" after a controversial photo shoot with Tyler Shields, where she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin called the image "too disturbing" and apologized, acknowledging it was "not funny" and understanding it "offends people." Chelsea Clinton condemned the photo as "vile and wrong." Shields defended the artwork, stating it was meant to stir controversy and provoke thought, emphasizing that it was not real and no harm was done. The photo shoot sparked widespread disdain, with Griffin vowing to remove the image. Shields, known for provocative work, defended his art, saying it reflects freedom of speech and that such reactions are part of the artistic process. The incident reignited debates over art, politics, and public reaction. END OF SUMMARY.
