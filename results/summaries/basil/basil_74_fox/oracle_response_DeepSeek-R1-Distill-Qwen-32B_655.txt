Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Kathy Griffin and her controversial photo with Tyler Shields. I need to focus on the morally charged words the author used: went, disturbing, funny, wrong, vile, threats, abuse, freedom, allowed.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Griffin admitted she went too far with the photo, which was disturbing and not funny. She apologized and took it down. People, including Chelsea Clinton, called it vile. Shields defended it as art, mentioning freedom of speech. He's had issues before with another photo causing threats and being accused of trivializing abuse.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible. I should mention Griffin's admission, the disturbing image, her saying it wasn't funny, calling it wrong. Include Chelsea Clinton's reaction as vile. Shields' defense about art, freedom, and allowed. Also, reference his past with Heather Morris and the death threats, tying in the abuse angle.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Griffin's admission, the image's impact, her apology, public reaction, Shields' defense, his past controversies, and the moral implications. Make sure to include all the key moral terms without making it too long.

I think that covers all the points. Let me put it together now.

SUMMARY:  
Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloodied mask of President Trump, calling the image "disturbing" and "not funny." She apologized, stating it was "wrong" and offensive, and promised to take it down. Chelsea Clinton condemned the photo as "vile and wrong." Photographer Tyler Shields defended the artwork, claiming it was meant to provoke thought and that "some people love it, some hate it." He emphasized it was not real and compared it to a movie still. Shields, known for controversial photos, has faced death threats in the past, including over a photo of Heather Morris that critics accused of trivializing domestic abuse. He defended his work, citing freedom of speech and the right to create such images without harm. Griffin, who joked about fleeing to Mexico after the photo's release, acknowledged her mistakes and expressed regret.  

END OF SUMMARY.
