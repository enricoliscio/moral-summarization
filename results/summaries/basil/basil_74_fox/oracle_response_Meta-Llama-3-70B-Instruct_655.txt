SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields, where she holds a bloodied mask of President Trump. The gory image, published in TMZ, was met with widespread disdain, with many calling it "disturbing" and "vile". Griffin herself acknowledged it "wasn't funny" and that she "made a mistake". Shields, known for his provocative work, defended the image as art meant to evoke a reaction, stating "that's what art is meant to do". However, this is not the first time Shields' work has sparked outrage, having previously received "death threats" over a photo that made light of domestic "abuse". Despite the backlash, Shields stands by the image, citing "freedom of speech" and the fact that he was "allowed" to create it. Griffin, on the other hand, has apologized and removed the image, acknowledging she was "wrong".

END OF SUMMARY.
