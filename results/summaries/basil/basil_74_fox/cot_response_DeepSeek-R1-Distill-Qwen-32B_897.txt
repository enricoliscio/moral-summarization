Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the morally framed words. The user wants me to list each word with a star, so I'll make sure to pick out terms that carry moral implications. Words like "controversial," "offends," "disturbing," "wrong," "vile," "touchy," "freedom of speech," "stir the pot," "kill," "imprisonment," "death threats," and "abuse" stand out. These words indicate the moral aspects discussed in the article.

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these terms where appropriate. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the main points: Kathy Griffin's photo shoot, her admission of going too far, the reactions, Tyler Shields' perspective, and the broader context of controversial art. I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the moral framing without being too lengthy.

I'll start by introducing Kathy Griffin and the photo, then mention her admission and the public reaction. I'll include Shields' defense of the art and his past controversies. Finally, I'll note the debate it sparked. This should cover all necessary points while keeping it under 200 words.

I should double-check that I included all the morally framed words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone. Making sure the summary is clear and concise is key. Once done, I'll present the identified words first and then the summary as per the user's instructions.
