Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her photo shoot with Tyler Shields. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Kathy Griffin did a photo shoot with Tyler Shields, known for controversial photos. The image in question is her holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. TMZ published it first, and it's pretty disturbing. Griffin later admitted on Twitter that she went too far and the image wasn't funny, apologizing and saying she'd take it down. People on Twitter were upset, including Chelsea Clinton calling it vile. Shields explained they wanted to make a bold political statement, and the image was meant as art, not real. He compared it to movies and mentioned it's just a still image. He also mentioned past controversies, like with Heather Morris, and doesn't regret working with Griffin. The video behind the scenes was removed but later re-uploaded.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start with Griffin's admission, the nature of the photo, her apology, public reaction, Shields' defense as art, and mention past controversies briefly. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going into too much detail.

Wait, did I miss anything? Oh, the part about moving to Mexico was a joke between them, but it's not crucial for the summary. Also, the behind-the-scenes video glitch is minor. Focus on the main elements: the photo, Griffin's apology, public and Clinton's reaction, Shields' explanation, and his past issues. That should cover it.
