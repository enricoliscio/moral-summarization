SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, where she is seen holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin admitted on Twitter that the image was "too disturbing" and that she "went too far." She also stated that she would take down the image. The photo sparked outrage on social media, with many calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image, saying it was meant to be a bold statement and a form of art, adding that it was not meant to be taken literally. This is not the first time Shields' photos have caused controversy, as he previously received death threats over a photo of an actress with bruises on her face.
