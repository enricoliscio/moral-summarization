SUMMARY:

Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with Tyler Shields, where she holds a bloodied mask of President Trump. The gory image was deemed "disturbing" and "vile" by many, including Chelsea Clinton, who tweeted that it was "vile and wrong". Griffin acknowledged that the image "isn't funny" and that she "made a mistake" by creating it. Shields, the photographer, defended the image as art meant to make a bold statement and spark controversy. He noted that it's a "touchy subject" and that some people would "hate it", but emphasized that it's not real and doesn't promote violence. Griffin has since taken down the image, saying she was "wrong" to create it. Shields, however, doesn't regret the collaboration, citing "freedom of speech" and the ability to create provocative art without facing "death threats" or "abuse".

END OF SUMMARY.
