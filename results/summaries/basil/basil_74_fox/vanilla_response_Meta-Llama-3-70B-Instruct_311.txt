SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, in which she is holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin tweeted that the image was "too disturbing" and "it wasn't funny," saying she understands how it offends people and that she's made mistakes in her career. She has since taken down the image. The photo sparked outrage on Twitter, with Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image as art, saying it was meant to make a statement and provoke a reaction. He added that the image was not meant to be taken literally and that it's a form of freedom of speech. This is not the first time Shields' photos have caused controversy, having previously received death threats over a photo of an actress with bruises on her face.
