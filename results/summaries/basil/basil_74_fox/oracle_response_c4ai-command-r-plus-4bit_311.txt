SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin and photographer Tyler Shields went too far with a disturbing photo depicting a fake, bloody Trump head. Griffin admitted the image was wrong and not funny, and took it down from Twitter, but not before inciting threats and disdain. Chelsea Clinton called it vile. Shields defended the image as art, invoking freedom of speech, but others saw it as abusing that freedom, and making light of abuse. 

END OF SUMMARY.
