SUMMARY:
Comedian Kathy Griffin and photographer Tyler Shields faced severe backlash and criticism for a disturbing photo shoot in which Griffin held a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin admitted that she "went too far" and that the image was "too disturbing" and "wasn't funny." She acknowledged that it offended people and expressed regret for her mistake. People on Twitter, including Chelsea Clinton, condemned the photo as vile and wrong. Shields defended their artistic freedom, stating that the image was meant to be bold and provocative, but understood that it could make viewers uncomfortable or even hate it. He also addressed the criticism and death threats he received for a previous photo that appeared to make light of domestic abuse. Shields stood by their collaboration, stating that he loved the idea of freedom of speech and the power of art to evoke strong emotions. However, Griffin took down the image, recognizing that it crossed a line. END OF SUMMARY.
