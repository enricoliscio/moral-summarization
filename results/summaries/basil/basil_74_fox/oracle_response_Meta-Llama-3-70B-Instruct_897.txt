SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with Tyler Shields, where she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin described the image as "disturbing" and "wrong," saying it "wasn't funny" and that she understands how it offends people. The image sparked widespread outrage, with Chelsea Clinton calling it "vile and wrong." Shields, the photographer, defended the image as art, saying it's meant to make a statement and provoke a reaction. He acknowledged that it could make some viewers uncomfortable, but emphasized that it's not meant to promote violence or harm. Shields has faced backlash before, including death threats over a previous photo that was criticized for making light of domestic abuse. Despite the controversy, Shields stands by his work, citing the importance of freedom of speech and the ability to create provocative images without fear of persecution. END OF SUMMARY.
