SUMMARY:
Comedian Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, where she is holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin tweeted that the image "is too disturbing" and "it wasn't funny," acknowledging that it "offends people." She apologized, saying "I went too far and I was wrong." Many, including Chelsea Clinton, condemned the photo, calling it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image as art, meant to make a bold statement and stir controversy. He argued that it's a form of free speech, and that it's not meant to be taken literally. Despite the backlash, Shields doesn't regret the collaboration, saying "I love the idea we have freedom of speech." Griffin, on the other hand, has taken down the image, acknowledging her mistake. END OF SUMMARY.
