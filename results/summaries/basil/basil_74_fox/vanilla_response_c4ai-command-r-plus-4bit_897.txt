SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin and photographer Tyler Shields faced backlash for a photo depicting Griffin holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin later apologized, admitting she "went too far" and that the image was "too disturbing." She acknowledged the offense it caused and took down the image. Chelsea Clinton and others expressed their disdain for the photo shoot on Twitter. Shields defended the image as a form of art and freedom of speech, but it is not the first time his work has caused controversy. He previously received death threats for a photo that appeared to make light of domestic abuse. Despite the backlash, Shields stands by the image and Griffin's intention to make a bold political statement. He emphasized that the image is not meant to be taken literally and is similar to a movie scene.
END OF SUMMARY.
