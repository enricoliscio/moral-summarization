SUMMARY:
Comedian Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" with a controversial photo shoot featuring a bloodied mask of President Trump, calling the image "too disturbing" and "wrong". Griffin apologized on Twitter, saying she understands how the image "offends people" and that she's made mistakes in her career. The photo, taken by photographer Tyler Shields, was meant to be a bold statement, but many, including Chelsea Clinton, deemed it "vile and wrong". Shields defended the image as art, saying it's meant to make viewers uncomfortable, but emphasized that it's not promoting violence. Despite the backlash, Shields doesn't regret the collaboration, citing freedom of speech. Griffin, however, has taken down the image, acknowledging her mistake. END OF SUMMARY.
