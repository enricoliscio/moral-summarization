SUMMARY:
Kathy Griffin has apologized for a controversial photo shoot in which she posed with a bloodied mask of President Trump, admitting that she "went too far." The image, created with photographer Tyler Shields, known for his provocative work, sparked outrage and was deemed *vile* and *wrong* by many, including Chelsea Clinton. Griffin expressed regret, acknowledging that the image was *disturbing* and *offensive*. She took responsibility for her *mistakes* and the potential repercussions, initially joking about moving to Mexico to avoid imprisonment. Shields defended their artistic freedom, stating that the image was meant to be provocative and make people uncomfortable, highlighting their *freedom of speech* and the *power* of art to evoke strong emotions. However, he also acknowledged that it might be seen as crossing a line, and some found it *hateful*. Shields stands by the collaboration despite the backlash, while recognizing the potential severity of the image's message. This incident underscores the delicate balance between artistic expression and *offensive* content, and the potential consequences that can arise from *vicious* imagery. 

END OF SUMMARY.
