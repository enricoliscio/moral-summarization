Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and the photo she took with Tyler Shields. The article is a bit long, so I'll start by reading through it carefully to understand the main points.

First, Kathy Griffin admitted she went too far with a photo where she's holding a bloodied mask of Trump. The photo was published by TMZ, and she later apologized on Twitter, saying it was too disturbing and not funny. She also mentioned making mistakes in her career and planning to take down the image.

Next, the article mentions that Griffin and Shields joked about moving to Mexico to avoid imprisonment. That's an interesting detail to include. There's also Chelsea Clinton's reaction, calling it "vile and wrong."

Then, Tyler Shields explains that the photo was meant to be art and a bold political statement. He argues that art can make people uncomfortable and that the image isn't real. He also mentions a behind-the-scenes video that was removed but later re-uploaded. Shields has had similar controversies before, like with Heather Morris, and he doesn't regret working with Griffin, emphasizing freedom of speech.

I should structure the summary to include these key points: Griffin's admission, the photo's impact, her apology, Shields' explanation, the political message, and the broader context of Shields' past controversies. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, making sure each point is clear and flows logically.

I'll start by introducing Griffin and the photo, then her apology, followed by Shields' defense and the context of his previous work. I'll end with the implications of their collaboration. That should cover all the essential elements without getting too detailed.
