SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin and Tyler Shields went too far with a disturbing and vile photo of Griffin holding a bloodied mask of President Trump. While Griffin admitted that the image was wrong and not funny, Shields defended it as a form of art and an exercise of freedom of speech. People on Twitter expressed their disdain for the photo, with Chelsea Clinton calling it out as wrong. Shields, known for his shocking images, has previously received threats for a photo that appeared to make light of domestic abuse. This new image with Griffin is another example of his willingness to push boundaries, but it has crossed a line for many. Griffin's reps have not commented further.
END OF SUMMARY.
