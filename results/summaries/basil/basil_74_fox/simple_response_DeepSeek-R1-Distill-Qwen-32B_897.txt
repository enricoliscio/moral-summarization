Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Kathy Griffin took a photo with Tyler Shields holding a bloodied Trump mask. The photo was published on TMZ and caused a stir. Griffin apologized, saying it was too disturbing and not funny. She admitted it was a mistake and would remove the image. Some people, like Chelsea Clinton, called it vile. Shields defended the photo as art meant to make a statement, saying it's not real and compares it to movies. He's had controversial photos before, like the Heather Morris one, which was criticized for trivializing domestic abuse. He doesn't regret working with Griffin and mentions freedom of speech.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects: Griffin's apology, the offense caused, Shields' defense of art, and the comparison to past controversies. Keep it under 200 words, include the key points, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: Start with Griffin's photo and apology, mention the reaction, Shields' explanation, his past controversies, and his stance on free speech. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like the offensiveness and the artistic intent.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and concise. Let me draft the summary accordingly.
