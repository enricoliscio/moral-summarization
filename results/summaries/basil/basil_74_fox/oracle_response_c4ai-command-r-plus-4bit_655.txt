SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin admitted that she "went too far" in a recent photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields, in which she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. The image, which Griffin herself described as "disturbing" and "not funny," caused widespread disdain and was criticized by many, including Chelsea Clinton, who called it "vile and wrong." Shields defended the image as a form of art, stating that it was meant to be provocative and that he is aware it could make viewers uncomfortable. He also highlighted the importance of freedom of speech and the fact that he is allowed to create such images. However, the photo shoot has sparked intense backlash, with some people even making threats against Griffin and Shields. Griffin has since apologized for the image, acknowledging that it was wrong and has taken it down. This incident raises important questions about the boundaries of artistic expression and the potential consequences of crossing them. 

END OF SUMMARY.
