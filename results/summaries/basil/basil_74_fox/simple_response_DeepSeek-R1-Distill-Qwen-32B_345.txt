Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kathy Griffin and her photo shoot with Tyler Shields. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Kathy Griffin admitted she went too far with a photo where she's holding a bloodied Trump mask. The photo was published on TMZ, and she later apologized on Twitter, saying it was too disturbing and not funny. She also mentioned making mistakes in her career. Some people, like Chelsea Clinton, called it vile and wrong. Tyler Shields defended the photo as art, saying it's meant to make people uncomfortable but it's not real. He compared it to movies and mentioned that it's a touchy subject. He also talked about freedom of speech and not regretting the collaboration. The article also mentions Shields' past controversial photos, like the one with Heather Morris from Glee, which was criticized for trivializing domestic abuse.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The article presents both Griffin's apology and Shields' defense. It's important to highlight the controversy, the reactions from the public, and the artistic versus offensive perspectives. I should also mention the comparison to previous controversies to show Shields' history.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral framing. I'll start with Griffin's admission, the photo details, her apology, public reactions, Shields' defense, and the context of his past work. I'll structure it so that the summary flows logically, showing both sides of the issue.
