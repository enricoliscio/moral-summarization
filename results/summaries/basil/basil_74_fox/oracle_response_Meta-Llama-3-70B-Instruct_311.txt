SUMMARY: Kathy Griffin admitted to going too far in a controversial photo shoot with Tyler Shields, where she holds a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin described the image as "disturbing” and “wrong,” saying she understands how it offends people. She took to Twitter to apologize, stating she made a mistake and would take down the image. Many, including Chelsea Clinton, expressed disdain for the photo, calling it “vile and wrong.” Shields, the photographer, defended the image as art, meant to make a bold statement and stir controversy. He acknowledged that it could make viewers uncomfortable, but emphasized that it's not real and doesn't promote violence. This is not the first time Shields' photos have caused uproar, having received death threats in the past for a photo that made light of domestic abuse. Shields stands by his work, valuing the freedom of speech that allows him to create such images. END OF SUMMARY.
