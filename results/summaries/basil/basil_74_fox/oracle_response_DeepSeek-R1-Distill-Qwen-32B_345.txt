SUMMARY:  
Kathy Griffin admitted she "went too far" after a controversial photo shoot with Tyler Shields, where she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. She called the image "disturbing" and "not funny," acknowledging it was "wrong" and apologized for offending people. Chelsea Clinton condemned it as "vile and wrong." Shields defended the photo as art, stating it was meant to make a bold political statement and that it was "not real." He emphasized that art can provoke strong reactions but argued it's protected under "freedom of speech." Shields has faced backlash before, including death threats over a photo of Heather Morris that critics saw as trivializing domestic abuse. Despite the controversy, he defended the collaboration with Griffin, saying he "can't speak for her" but emphasized his belief in artistic expression.
